TL;DR: 这是首个专门研究三维和四维世界建模的综述文章，建立了标准化定义和分类系统，系统总结了视频基、占位基和雷达基方法，并提供了数据集和评估指标的系统分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要集中在2D图像生成，忽视了3D/4D表示的重要性，同时缺乏标准化定义和分类导致研究分散不一致。

Method: 通过系统性综述方法，建立了三维四维世界建模的精确定义和结构化分类系统（VideoGen、OccGen、LiDARGen），系统总结了专门的数据集和评估指标。

Result: 提供了一个包含准确定义、结构化分类、数据集资源和评估标准的全面参考框架，为领域研究提供了基础性支撑。

Abstract: World modeling has become a cornerstone in AI research, enabling agents to
understand, represent, and predict the dynamic environments they inhabit. While
prior work largely emphasizes generative methods for 2D image and video data,
they overlook the rapidly growing body of work that leverages native 3D and 4D
representations such as RGB-D imagery, occupancy grids, and LiDAR point clouds
for large-scale scene modeling. At the same time, the absence of a standardized
definition and taxonomy for ``world models'' has led to fragmented and
sometimes inconsistent claims in the literature. This survey addresses these
gaps by presenting the first comprehensive review explicitly dedicated to 3D
and 4D world modeling and generation. We establish precise definitions,
introduce a structured taxonomy spanning video-based (VideoGen),
occupancy-based (OccGen), and LiDAR-based (LiDARGen) approaches, and
systematically summarize datasets and evaluation metrics tailored to 3D/4D
settings. We further discuss practical applications, identify open challenges,
and highlight promising research directions, aiming to provide a coherent and
foundational reference for advancing the field. A systematic summary of
existing literature is available at https://github.com/worldbench/survey

TL;DR: XFloodNet是一个基于深度学习的新型城市洪水分类框架，通过多模态特征融合和分层注意力机制，在三个基准数据集上取得了最先进的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统洪水检测方法依赖单模态数据和静态规则系统，无法捕捉洪水事件的动态非线性关系，现有注意力机制和集成学习方法在分层细化、跨模态特征集成以及对噪声环境的适应性方面存在局限性。

Method: XFloodNet集成了三个核心组件：1)分层跨模态门控注意力机制，动态对齐视觉和文本特征；2)异构卷积自适应多尺度注意力模块，提取和优先处理判别性洪水相关特征；3)级联卷积变换器特征细化技术，通过自适应缩放和级联操作协调分层特征。

Result: 在Chennai Floods、Rhine18 Floods和Harz17 Floods三个基准数据集上，XFloodNet分别实现了93.33%、82.24%和88.60%的F1分数，显著超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: XFloodNet通过创新的深度学习技术重新定义了城市洪水分类，为解决城市洪水检测中的动态非线性关系和多模态数据融合问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In an era of escalating climate change, urban flooding has emerged as a
critical challenge for sustainable cities, threatening lives, infrastructure,
and ecosystems. Traditional flood detection methods are constrained by their
reliance on unimodal data and static rule-based systems, which fail to capture
the dynamic, non-linear relationships inherent in flood events. Furthermore,
existing attention mechanisms and ensemble learning approaches exhibit
limitations in hierarchical refinement, cross-modal feature integration, and
adaptability to noisy or unstructured environments, resulting in suboptimal
flood classification performance. To address these challenges, we present
XFloodNet, a novel framework that redefines urban flood classification through
advanced deep-learning techniques. XFloodNet integrates three novel components:
(1) a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Gated Attention mechanism that dynamically
aligns visual and textual features, enabling precise multi-granularity
interactions and resolving contextual ambiguities; (2) a Heterogeneous
Convolutional Adaptive Multi-Scale Attention module, which leverages
frequency-enhanced channel attention and frequency-modulated spatial attention
to extract and prioritize discriminative flood-related features across spectral
and spatial domains; and (3) a Cascading Convolutional Transformer Feature
Refinement technique that harmonizes hierarchical features through adaptive
scaling and cascading operations, ensuring robust and noise-resistant flood
detection. We evaluate our proposed method on three benchmark datasets, such as
Chennai Floods, Rhine18 Floods, and Harz17 Floods, XFloodNet achieves
state-of-the-art F1-scores of 93.33%, 82.24%, and 88.60%, respectively,
surpassing existing methods by significant margins.

### [3] [Video Parallel Scaling: Aggregating Diverse Frame Subsets for VideoLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08016)
*Hyungjin Chung,Hyelin Nam,Jiyeon Kim,Hyojun Go,Byeongjun Park,Junho Kim,Joonseok Lee,Seongsu Ha,Byung-Hoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video Parallel Scaling (VPS) 是一种推理时方法，通过并行处理视频帧子集来扩展VideoLLMs的感知带宽，避免长上下文窗口带来的计算成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VideoLLMs在处理更多输入帧以捕捉细粒度时间细节时面临计算成本过高和长上下文长度导致的性能下降问题。

Method: VPS运行多个并行推理流，每个流处理视频帧的不同子集，然后聚合这些互补流的输出概率来整合更丰富的视觉信息。

Result: 在Video-MME和EventHallusion等基准测试中，VPS在不同模型架构和规模(2B-32B)上均显著提升性能，比Self-consistency等并行替代方案扩展性更好。

Conclusion: VPS提供了一个内存高效且鲁棒的框架，可增强VideoLLMs的时间推理能力，且与其他解码策略互补，无需额外训练即可提升性能。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) face a critical bottleneck:
increasing the number of input frames to capture fine-grained temporal detail
leads to prohibitive computational costs and performance degradation from long
context lengths. We introduce Video Parallel Scaling (VPS), an inference-time
method that expands a model's perceptual bandwidth without increasing its
context window. VPS operates by running multiple parallel inference streams,
each processing a unique, disjoint subset of the video's frames. By aggregating
the output probabilities from these complementary streams, VPS integrates a
richer set of visual information than is possible with a single pass. We
theoretically show that this approach effectively contracts the Chinchilla
scaling law by leveraging uncorrelated visual evidence, thereby improving
performance without additional training. Extensive experiments across various
model architectures and scales (2B-32B) on benchmarks such as Video-MME and
EventHallusion demonstrate that VPS consistently and significantly improves
performance. It scales more favorably than other parallel alternatives (e.g.
Self-consistency) and is complementary to other decoding strategies, offering a
memory-efficient and robust framework for enhancing the temporal reasoning
capabilities of VideoLLMs.

TL;DR: 多模态立场检测框架，通过大语言模型和图像描述生成器整合文本与视觉信息，在气候变化立场检测任务上超越现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有立场检测方法主要关注文本数据，而真实社交媒体内容越来越多地结合文本和视觉元素，需要进阶的多模态方法

Method: 采用分层融合方法：大语言模型提取文本摘要，领域知识图像描述生成器解释视觉内容，专门的transformer模块建模文本与图像之间的交互作用

Result: 在MultiClimate数据集上达到准确率76.2%、精度76.3%、召回率76.2%和F1分76.2%，超越现有最优方法

Conclusion: 该多模态框架能够有效整合多种模态信息，实现稳健的立场分类，为社交媒体分析提供了更加全面的解决方案

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of information across digital platforms, stance
detection has emerged as a pivotal challenge in social media analysis. While
most of the existing approaches focus solely on textual data, real-world social
media content increasingly combines text with visual elements creating a need
for advanced multimodal methods. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal
stance detection framework that integrates textual and visual information
through a hierarchical fusion approach. Our method first employs a Large
Language Model to retrieve stance-relevant summaries from source text, while a
domain-aware image caption generator interprets visual content in the context
of the target topic. These modalities are then jointly modeled along with the
reply text, through a specialized transformer module that captures interactions
between the texts and images. The proposed modality fusion framework integrates
diverse modalities to facilitate robust stance classification. We evaluate our
approach on the MultiClimate dataset, a benchmark for climate change-related
stance detection containing aligned video frames and transcripts. We achieve
accuracy of 76.2%, precision of 76.3%, recall of 76.2% and F1-score of 76.2%,
respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

### [6] [MCTED: A Machine-Learning-Ready Dataset for Digital Elevation Model Generation From Mars Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08027)
*Rafał Osadnik,Pablo Gómez,Eleni Bohacek,Rickbir Bahia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 一个新的火星数字高程模型预测数据集MCTED，包含80,898个样本，用于机器学习应用，小型U-Net模型在该数据集上的表现超过了零样本深度估计基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模DEM处理流程中存在的人工物和缺失数据问题，为火星表面高程模型预测任务提供专门的机器学习数据集。

Method: 使用火星重追水手卡众成像仪(CTX)获取的高分辨率火星正弄图像和DEM对，通过综合处理流程生成80,898个数据样本，包含光学图像补丁、DEM补丁和两个掩码补丁，分为训练集和验证集。

Result: 生成了MCTED数据集，包含7,000个验证样本和73,898个训练样本，并提供了统计分析。小型U-Net模型在该数据集上的表现超过了DepthAnythingV2基础模型的零样本性能。

Conclusion: MCTED数据集为火星DEM预测任务提供了专门的机器学习资源，小型专门模型的表现超过大型通用基础模型，数据集和代码已开源发布。

Abstract: This work presents a new dataset for the Martian digital elevation model
prediction task, ready for machine learning applications called MCTED. The
dataset has been generated using a comprehensive pipeline designed to process
high-resolution Mars orthoimage and DEM pairs from Day et al., yielding a
dataset consisting of 80,898 data samples. The source images are data gathered
by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter using the CTX instrument, providing a very
diverse and comprehensive coverage of the Martian surface. Given the complexity
of the processing pipelines used in large-scale DEMs, there are often artefacts
and missing data points in the original data, for which we developed tools to
solve or mitigate their impact. We divide the processed samples into training
and validation splits, ensuring samples in both splits cover no mutual areas to
avoid data leakage. Every sample in the dataset is represented by the optical
image patch, DEM patch, and two mask patches, indicating values that were
originally missing or were altered by us. This allows future users of the
dataset to handle altered elevation regions as they please. We provide
statistical insights of the generated dataset, including the spatial
distribution of samples, the distributions of elevation values, slopes and
more. Finally, we train a small U-Net architecture on the MCTED dataset and
compare its performance to a monocular depth estimation foundation model,
DepthAnythingV2, on the task of elevation prediction. We find that even a very
small architecture trained on this dataset specifically, beats a zero-shot
performance of a depth estimation foundation model like DepthAnythingV2. We
make the dataset and code used for its generation completely open source in
public repositories.

### [7] [APML: Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss for Robust 3D Point Cloud Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08104)
*Sasan Sharifipour,Constantino Álvarez Casado,Mohammad Sabokrou,Miguel Bordallo López*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了自适应概率匹配损失（APML），一种完全可微分的一对一匹配近似方法，通过Sinkhorn迭代和温度缩放相似度矩阵来解决点云预测中传统损失函数的点拥堵和覆盖不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统点云预测损失函数（如Chamfer Distance）依赖最近邻分配，导致多对一对应关系，造成密集区域点拥堵和稀疏区域覆盖不足，且包含不可微分操作。Earth Mover Distance虽然效果好但计算复杂度高。

Method: 使用Sinkhorn迭代在温度缩放的相似度矩阵上进行概率匹配，通过分析计算温度来保证最小分配概率，无需手动调参，实现近二次方时间复杂度。

Result: 在ShapeNet基准测试和WiFi CSI到3D人体点云生成的时空Transformer上，APML损失实现了更快收敛、更好的空间分布（特别是在低密度区域），以及相当或改进的定量性能。

Conclusion: APML损失提供了一种高效可微分的替代方案，解决了传统点云损失函数的局限性，在多个应用场景中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Training deep learning models for point cloud prediction tasks such as shape
completion and generation depends critically on loss functions that measure
discrepancies between predicted and ground-truth point sets. Commonly used
functions such as Chamfer Distance (CD), HyperCD, and InfoCD rely on
nearest-neighbor assignments, which often induce many-to-one correspondences,
leading to point congestion in dense regions and poor coverage in sparse
regions. These losses also involve non-differentiable operations due to index
selection, which may affect gradient-based optimization. Earth Mover Distance
(EMD) enforces one-to-one correspondences and captures structural similarity
more effectively, but its cubic computational complexity limits its practical
use. We propose the Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss (APML), a fully
differentiable approximation of one-to-one matching that leverages Sinkhorn
iterations on a temperature-scaled similarity matrix derived from pairwise
distances. We analytically compute the temperature to guarantee a minimum
assignment probability, eliminating manual tuning. APML achieves near-quadratic
runtime, comparable to Chamfer-based losses, and avoids non-differentiable
operations. When integrated into state-of-the-art architectures (PoinTr, PCN,
FoldingNet) on ShapeNet benchmarks and on a spatiotemporal Transformer (CSI2PC)
that generates 3D human point clouds from WiFi CSI measurements, APM loss
yields faster convergence, superior spatial distribution, especially in
low-density regions, and improved or on-par quantitative performance without
additional hyperparameter search. The code is available at:

### [8] [Lightweight Deep Unfolding Networks with Enhanced Robustness for Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08205)
*Jingjing Liu,Yinchao Han,Xianchao Xiu,Jianhua Zhang,Wanquan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出L-RPCANet，一种基于RPCA的轻量级红外小目标检测框架，通过瓶颈结构和噪声抑制模块实现参数轻量化和噪声鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度展开网络在红外小目标检测中存在参数不够轻量和噪声鲁棒性不足的问题

Method: 构建分层瓶颈结构减少通道维度，嵌入噪声抑制模块，采用SENet通道注意力机制

Result: 在ISTD数据集上验证了优于RPCANet、DRPCANet和RPCANet++等先进方法的性能

Conclusion: L-RPCANet在保持轻量级和鲁棒性的同时实现了优异的检测性能

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is one of the key techniques in image
processing. Although deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have demonstrated promising
performance in ISTD due to their model interpretability and data adaptability,
existing methods still face significant challenges in parameter lightweightness
and noise robustness. In this regard, we propose a highly lightweight framework
based on robust principal component analysis (RPCA) called L-RPCANet.
Technically, a hierarchical bottleneck structure is constructed to reduce and
increase the channel dimension in the single-channel input infrared image to
achieve channel-wise feature refinement, with bottleneck layers designed in
each module to extract features. This reduces the number of channels in feature
extraction and improves the lightweightness of network parameters. Furthermore,
a noise reduction module is embedded to enhance the robustness against complex
noise. In addition, squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENets) are leveraged as a
channel attention mechanism to focus on the varying importance of different
features across channels, thereby achieving excellent performance while
maintaining both lightweightness and robustness. Extensive experiments on the
ISTD datasets validate the superiority of our proposed method compared with
state-of-the-art methods covering RPCANet, DRPCANet, and RPCANet++. The code
will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/L-RPCANet.

### [9] [Sparse Transformer for Ultra-sparse Sampled Video Compressive Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08228)
*Miao Cao,Siming Zheng,Lishun Wang,Ziyang Chen,David Brady,Xin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了超稀疏采样(USS)策略和BSTFormer模型，通过在光学传感器层进行高频调制来降低视频捐像的功耗，实现了10-100倍的功耗优化和更高的动态范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高分辨率、高帧率摄像头的高功耗问题，传统的4K传感器在30fps下功耗达20W，而千万像素摄像头在100-1000fps下的功耗将无法持续。

Method: 提出超稀疏采样(USS)策略，在每个空间位置只设置一个子帧为1，其他为0；设计了BSTFormer模型，结合局部块注意力、全局稀疏注意力和时间注意力来利用USS测量的稀疏性。

Result: 在模拟和实际数据上的实验结果显示，该方法显著超越了之前的所有最优算法，并且USS策略比随机采样(RS)策略具有更高的动态范围。

Conclusion: USS策略因其固定曝光时间特性，是实现芯片上完整视频SCI系统的良好选择，为高速、高分辨率摄像提供了可持续的解决方案。

Abstract: Digital cameras consume ~0.1 microjoule per pixel to capture and encode
video, resulting in a power usage of ~20W for a 4K sensor operating at 30 fps.
Imagining gigapixel cameras operating at 100-1000 fps, the current processing
model is unsustainable. To address this, physical layer compressive measurement
has been proposed to reduce power consumption per pixel by 10-100X. Video
Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) introduces high frequency modulation in the
optical sensor layer to increase effective frame rate. A commonly used sampling
strategy of video SCI is Random Sampling (RS) where each mask element value is
randomly set to be 0 or 1. Similarly, image inpainting (I2P) has demonstrated
that images can be recovered from a fraction of the image pixels. Inspired by
I2P, we propose Ultra-Sparse Sampling (USS) regime, where at each spatial
location, only one sub-frame is set to 1 and all others are set to 0. We then
build a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) encoding system to verify the
effectiveness of our USS strategy. Ideally, we can decompose the USS
measurement into sub-measurements for which we can utilize I2P algorithms to
recover high-speed frames. However, due to the mismatch between the DMD and
CCD, the USS measurement cannot be perfectly decomposed. To this end, we
propose BSTFormer, a sparse TransFormer that utilizes local Block attention,
global Sparse attention, and global Temporal attention to exploit the sparsity
of the USS measurement. Extensive results on both simulated and real-world data
show that our method significantly outperforms all previous state-of-the-art
algorithms. Additionally, an essential advantage of the USS strategy is its
higher dynamic range than that of the RS strategy. Finally, from the
application perspective, the USS strategy is a good choice to implement a
complete video SCI system on chip due to its fixed exposure time.

Motivation: 现有视频异常检测方法难以检测枪击、刺杀等致命事件，主要因为这些事件罕见且存在数据收集的伦理问题。

Method: 利用GTA5游戏构建致命视频数据集，包含多视角CCTV视频；提出基于Wasserstein对抗训练的片段级域适应策略，弥合合成数据与真实数据特征差距。

Result: 实验验证了GTA-Crime数据集的有效性，结合域适应策略能持续提升真实世界致命暴力检测准确率。

Conclusion: GTA-Crime为解决致命事件检测的数据稀缺问题提供了有效解决方案，数据集和生成框架已开源。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video anomaly detection (VAD) have enabled
identification of various criminal activities in surveillance videos, but
detecting fatal incidents such as shootings and stabbings remains difficult due
to their rarity and ethical issues in data collection. Recognizing this
limitation, we introduce GTA-Crime, a fatal video anomaly dataset and
generation framework using Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA5). Our dataset contains
fatal situations such as shootings and stabbings, captured from CCTV multiview
perspectives under diverse conditions including action types, weather, time of
day, and viewpoints. To address the rarity of such scenarios, we also release a
framework for generating these types of videos. Additionally, we propose a
snippet-level domain adaptation strategy using Wasserstein adversarial training
to bridge the gap between synthetic GTA-Crime features and real-world features
like UCF-Crime. Experimental results validate our GTA-Crime dataset and
demonstrate that incorporating GTA-Crime with our domain adaptation strategy
consistently enhances real world fatal violence detection accuracy. Our dataset
and the data generation framework are publicly available at

Motivation: 解决ViT模型预训练于三频道自然图像而X光照片是单频道灰度图像的格式不匹配问题

Method: 提出RepViT-CXR方法，通过通道复制策略将单频道CXR图像转换为ViT兼容格式，不引入额外信息损失

Result: 在TB-CXR数据集上达到99.9%准确度和AUC，超越Topo-CXR；在儿科肺炎数据集上达到99.0%准确度；在Shenzhen TB数据集上达到91.1%准确度

Conclusion: 简单有效的通道复制策略能让ViT在灰度医学图像任务上充分发挥表征能力，为临床筛查系统提供了强大潜力

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging remains one of the most widely used diagnostic
tools for detecting pulmonary diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) and pneumonia.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Vision Transformers (ViTs), have
shown strong potential for automated medical image analysis. However, most ViT
architectures are pretrained on natural images and require three-channel
inputs, while CXR scans are inherently grayscale. To address this gap, we
propose RepViT-CXR, a channel replication strategy that adapts single-channel
CXR images into a ViT-compatible format without introducing additional
information loss. We evaluate RepViT-CXR on three benchmark datasets. On the
TB-CXR dataset,our method achieved an accuracy of 99.9% and an AUC of 99.9%,
surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods such as Topo-CXR (99.3% accuracy,
99.8% AUC). For the Pediatric Pneumonia dataset, RepViT-CXR obtained 99.0%
accuracy, with 99.2% recall, 99.3% precision, and an AUC of 99.0%,
outperforming strong baselines including DCNN and VGG16. On the Shenzhen TB
dataset, our approach achieved 91.1% accuracy and an AUC of 91.2%, marking a
performance improvement over previously reported CNN-based methods. These
results demonstrate that a simple yet effective channel replication strategy
allows ViTs to fully leverage their representational power on grayscale medical
imaging tasks. RepViT-CXR establishes a new state of the art for TB and
pneumonia detection from chest X-rays, showing strong potential for deployment
in real-world clinical screening systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多数基于预训练或忽略了脑部疾病引起的不对称特征，需要一种能够重点关注病理性不对称的方法来提高诊断性能。

Method: 提出结合3D CNN编码器和对称交互Transformer(SIT)的端到端网络。通过交互均等网格块获取操作，将左右半球特征对齐后输入SIT进行诊断分析。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效检测AD引起的不对称病理特征，显示了较好的解释性和有效性，为阴性症诊断提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) combined with deep learning has
achieved remarkable progress in the prediction and diagnosis of Alzheimer's
disease (AD). Existing studies have used CNN and transformer to build a
well-performing network, but most of them are based on pretraining or ignoring
the asymmetrical character caused by brain disorders. We propose an end-to-end
network for the detection of disease-based asymmetric induced by left and right
brain atrophy which consist of 3D CNN Encoder and Symmetry Interactive
Transformer (SIT). Following the inter-equal grid block fetch operation, the
corresponding left and right hemisphere features are aligned and subsequently
fed into the SIT for diagnostic analysis. SIT can help the model focus more on
the regions of asymmetry caused by structural changes, thus improving
diagnostic performance. We evaluated our method based on the ADNI dataset, and
the results show that the method achieves better diagnostic accuracy (92.5\%)
compared to several CNN methods and CNNs combined with a general transformer.
The visualization results show that our network pays more attention in regions
of brain atrophy, especially for the asymmetric pathological characteristics
induced by AD, demonstrating the interpretability and effectiveness of the
method.

that leverages the high temporal resolution of event cameras to mitigate motion
blur and enable intermediate frame prediction. Specifically, the Learnable
Double Integral (LDI) network is designed to estimate the mapping relation
between reference frames and sharp latent images. Then, we refine the coarse
results and optimize overall training efficiency by introducing a
learning-based division reconstruction module, enabling images to be converted
with varying exposure intervals. We devise an adaptive parameter-free fusion
strategy to obtain the final results, utilizing the confidence embedded in the
LDI outputs of concurrent events. A self-supervised learning framework is
proposed to enable network training with real-world blurry videos and events by
exploring the mutual constraints among blurry frames, latent images, and event
streams. We further construct a dataset with real-world blurry images and
events using a DAVIS346c camera, demonstrating the generalizability of the
proposed EVDI++ in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in video deblurring and interpolation tasks.

TL;DR: 提出HyMamba网络，利用状态空间模块统一建模光谱、跨深度和时间信息，在高光谱目标跟踪中实现SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高光谱跟踪器无法有效捕捉内在光谱信息、时间依赖性和跨深度交互，需要新的方法来充分利用高光谱数据的丰富信息

Method: 设计Spectral State Integration (SSI)模块和Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM)模块，通过三个方向扫描的状态空间模块同步学习空间和光谱信息，构建假彩色和高光谱输入的联合特征

Result: 在7个基准数据集上达到最先进性能，在HOTC2020数据集上获得73.0%的AUC分数和96.3%的DP@20分数

Conclusion: HyMamba通过统一的光谱、跨深度和时间建模，有效解决了高光谱目标跟踪中的关键挑战，展现了优越的性能

Abstract: Hyperspectral object tracking holds great promise due to the rich spectral
information and fine-grained material distinctions in hyperspectral images,
which are beneficial in challenging scenarios. While existing hyperspectral
trackers have made progress by either transforming hyperspectral data into
false-color images or incorporating modality fusion strategies, they often fail
to capture the intrinsic spectral information, temporal dependencies, and
cross-depth interactions. To address these limitations, a new hyperspectral
object tracking network equipped with Mamba (HyMamba), is proposed. It unifies
spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling through state space modules
(SSMs). The core of HyMamba lies in the Spectral State Integration (SSI)
module, which enables progressive refinement and propagation of spectral
features with cross-depth and temporal spectral information. Embedded within
each SSI, the Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM) module is introduced to learn spatial
and spectral information synchronously via three directional scanning SSMs.
Based on SSI and HSM, HyMamba constructs joint features from false-color and
hyperspectral inputs, and enhances them through interaction with original
spectral features extracted from raw hyperspectral images. Extensive
experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyMamba
achieves state-of-the-art performance. For instance, it achieves 73.0\% of the
AUC score and 96.3\% of the DP@20 score on the HOTC2020 dataset. The code will
be released at https://github.com/lgao001/HyMamba.

TL;DR: VLMs存在固有偏见，在回答需要关注图像特定区域的精确问题时表现不佳。研究建立了多维分析框架，发现图像特征和提示语细微变化会导致VLM回答方式和性能显著变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现VLMs在训练过程中学习到的固有偏见会影响其对图像视觉属性的判断，特别是在需要关注图像特定区域的精确问题上表现不佳，需要系统分析导致这种性能差异的因素。

Method: 建立多维分析框架，使用开源VLMs，通过改变输入参数（如图像大小、物体数量、背景颜色、提示语特异性）来研究注意力值的变化，系统分析图像和提示语特征对模型性能的影响。

Result: 研究表明，即使图像特征和提示语特异性的微小变化也会导致VLM回答方式和整体性能的显著变化，验证了模型对输入参数的高度敏感性。

Conclusion: VLMs对输入数据的细微变化非常敏感，需要开发更好的方法来表征和理解这种变化，以提高模型在精确视觉任务中的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent research on Vision Language Models (VLMs) suggests that they rely on
inherent biases learned during training to respond to questions about visual
properties of an image. These biases are exacerbated when VLMs are asked highly
specific questions that require focusing on specific areas of the image. For
example, a VLM tasked with counting stars on a modified American flag (e.g.,
with more than 50 stars) will often disregard the visual evidence and fail to
answer accurately. We build upon this research and develop a multi-dimensional
examination framework to systematically determine which characteristics of the
input data, including both the image and the accompanying prompt, lead to such
differences in performance. Using open-source VLMs, we further examine how
attention values fluctuate with varying input parameters (e.g., image size,
number of objects in the image, background color, prompt specificity). This
research aims to learn how the behavior of vision language models changes and
to explore methods for characterizing such changes. Our results suggest, among
other things, that even minor modifications in image characteristics and prompt
specificity can lead to large changes in how a VLM formulates its answer and,
subsequently, its overall performance.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了3D点云零样本分割中的过置信问题，无需为见过和未见数据使用单独的分类器，显著提升了模型性能

Abstract: Generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds aims to
classify each point into both seen and unseen classes. A significant challenge
with these models is their tendency to make biased predictions, often favoring
the classes encountered during training. This problem is more pronounced in 3D
applications, where the scale of the training data is typically smaller than in
image-based tasks. To address this problem, we propose a novel method called
E3DPC-GZSL, which reduces overconfident predictions towards seen classes
without relying on separate classifiers for seen and unseen data. E3DPC-GZSL
tackles the overconfidence problem by integrating an evidence-based uncertainty
estimator into a classifier. This estimator is then used to adjust prediction
probabilities using a dynamic calibrated stacking factor that accounts for
pointwise prediction uncertainty. In addition, E3DPC-GZSL introduces a novel
training strategy that improves uncertainty estimation by refining the semantic
space. This is achieved by merging learnable parameters with text-derived
features, thereby improving model optimization for unseen data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation datasets, including
ScanNet v2 and S3DIS.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的弱监督物体检测方法，解决了现有方法在伪真实框生成、基础网络结构和优化过程中的三个关键问题，在PASCAL VOC数据集上达到了狭领先水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的弱监督物体检测方法存在三个主要问题：1）伪真实框要么只关注区别性部分要么无法区分相邻的同类实例；2）WSDDN基础网络缺乏背景类表征且分支间语义间隔大；3）忽略建议在优化中被丢弃，导致收敛慢。

Method: 提出了三个核心技术：1）热力图导向的建议选择算法(HGPS)，利用双阈值预选建议；2）弱监督基础检测网络(WSBDN)，为每个建议增加背景类表征并使用热力图进行预监测；3）负确定性监督损失，加速忽略建议的收敛。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2007和2012数据集上分别达到了58.5%/81.8%和55.6%/80.5%的mAP/mCorLoc分数，表现超过了当前最先进的弱监督物体检测方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法有效解决了弱监督物体检测中的三个关键问题，通过热力图导向的建议选择、基础网络改进和负确定性监督等技术，显著提升了检测性能和收敛速度。

Abstract: Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has attracted significant attention
in recent years, as it does not require box-level annotations. State-of-the-art
methods generally adopt a multi-module network, which employs WSDDN as the
multiple instance detection network module and multiple instance refinement
modules to refine performance. However, these approaches suffer from three key
limitations. First, existing methods tend to generate pseudo GT boxes that
either focus only on discriminative parts, failing to capture the whole object,
or cover the entire object but fail to distinguish between adjacent intra-class
instances. Second, the foundational WSDDN architecture lacks a crucial
background class representation for each proposal and exhibits a large semantic
gap between its branches. Third, prior methods discard ignored proposals during
optimization, leading to slow convergence. To address these challenges, we
first design a heatmap-guided proposal selector (HGPS) algorithm, which
utilizes dual thresholds on heatmaps to pre-select proposals, enabling pseudo
GT boxes to both capture the full object extent and distinguish between
adjacent intra-class instances. We then present a weakly supervised basic
detection network (WSBDN), which augments each proposal with a background class
representation and uses heatmaps for pre-supervision to bridge the semantic gap
between matrices. At last, we introduce a negative certainty supervision loss
on ignored proposals to accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on the
challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our framework. We achieve mAP/mCorLoc scores of 58.5%/81.8% on VOC 2007 and
55.6%/80.5% on VOC 2012, performing favorably against the state-of-the-art WSOD
methods. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: Oil palm cultivation remains one of the leading causes of deforestation in
Indonesia. To better track and address this challenge, detailed and reliable
mapping is needed to support sustainability efforts and emerging regulatory
frameworks. We present an open-access geospatial dataset of oil palm
plantations and related land cover types in Indonesia, produced through expert

provides polygon-based, wall-to-wall annotations across a range of
agro-ecological zones and includes a hierarchical typology that distinguishes
oil palm planting stages as well as similar perennial crops. Quality was
ensured through multi-interpreter consensus and field validation. The dataset
was created using wall-to-wall digitization over large grids, making it
suitable for training and benchmarking both conventional convolutional neural
networks and newer geospatial foundation models. Released under a CC-BY

Conclusion: SimCroP框架通过相似性驱动对齐和跨粒度融合，能够更好地捕捉稀疏放射图像中的关键病理结构，在多尺度下游任务中表现出优异性能。

Abstract: Medical vision-language pre-training shows great potential in learning
representative features from massive paired radiographs and reports. However,
in computed tomography (CT) scans, the distribution of lesions which contain
intricate structures is characterized by spatial sparsity. Besides, the complex
and implicit relationships between different pathological descriptions in each
sentence of the report and their corresponding sub-regions in radiographs pose
additional challenges. In this paper, we propose a Similarity-Driven
Cross-Granularity Pre-training (SimCroP) framework on chest CTs, which combines
similarity-driven alignment and cross-granularity fusion to improve radiograph
interpretation. We first leverage multi-modal masked modeling to optimize the
encoder for understanding precise low-level semantics from radiographs. Then,
similarity-driven alignment is designed to pre-train the encoder to adaptively
select and align the correct patches corresponding to each sentence in reports.
The cross-granularity fusion module integrates multimodal information across
instance level and word-patch level, which helps the model better capture key
pathology structures in sparse radiographs, resulting in improved performance
for multi-scale downstream tasks. SimCroP is pre-trained on a large-scale
paired CT-reports dataset and validated on image classification and
segmentation tasks across five public datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that SimCroP outperforms both cutting-edge medical self-supervised
learning methods and medical vision-language pre-training methods. Codes and
models are available at https://github.com/ToniChopp/SimCroP.

TL;DR: BTS-EE是一种针对早期退出网络的顺序训练方法，通过分支顺序训练和校准来解决协方差偏移问题，在保持精度的同时显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时图像分类在资源受限平台上需要平衡精度和延迟/功耗。传统早期退出训练存在协方差偏移问题：下游分支在全数据集上训练，但推理时只处理未退出的困难样本，限制了效率-精度权衡。

Method: 提出BTS-EE顺序训练方案，逐分支训练和校准以对齐推理时数据分布；设计基于1D卷积的轻量分支架构；提出类精度边际(CPM)校准方法实现逐类阈值调优。

Result: 在CINIC-10数据集和ResNet18骨干网络上，BTS-EE在64种配置中均优于非增强训练，计算量减少高达45%，精度仅下降2%。

Conclusion: BTS-EE扩展了CNN在实时图像处理系统中的部署设计空间，为工业检测、嵌入式视觉和无人机监控等应用提供实用效率增益。

Abstract: Real-time image classification on resource-constrained platforms demands
inference methods that balance accuracy with strict latency and power budgets.
Early-exit strategies address this need by attaching auxiliary classifiers to
intermediate layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), allowing "easy"
samples to terminate inference early. However, conventional training of early
exits introduces a covariance shift: downstream branches are trained on full
datasets, while at inference they process only the harder, non-exited samples.
This mismatch limits efficiency--accuracy trade-offs in practice. We introduce
the Boosted Training Scheme for Early Exits (BTS-EE), a sequential training
approach that aligns branch training with inference-time data distributions.
Each branch is trained and calibrated before the next, ensuring robustness
under selective inference conditions. To further support embedded deployment,
we propose a lightweight branch architecture based on 1D convolutions and a
Class Precision Margin (CPM) calibration method that enables per-class
threshold tuning for reliable exit decisions. Experiments on the CINIC-10
dataset with a ResNet18 backbone demonstrate that BTS-EE consistently
outperforms non-boosted training across 64 configurations, achieving up to 45
percent reduction in computation with only 2 percent accuracy degradation.
These results expand the design space for deploying CNNs in real-time image
processing systems, offering practical efficiency gains for applications such
as industrial inspection, embedded vision, and UAV-based monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate and early diagnosis of malignant melanoma is critical for improving
patient outcomes. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise
in dermoscopic image analysis, they often neglect clinical metadata and require
extensive preprocessing. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a multimodal
alternative but struggle to capture clinical specificity when trained on
general-domain data. To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented VLM
framework that incorporates semantically similar patient cases into the
diagnostic prompt. Our method enables informed predictions without fine-tuning
and significantly improves classification accuracy and error correction over
conventional baselines. These results demonstrate that retrieval-augmented
prompting provides a robust strategy for clinical decision support.

Abstract: Three-dimensional Object Detection from multi-view cameras and LiDAR is a
crucial component for autonomous driving and smart transportation. However, in
the process of basic feature extraction, perspective transformation, and
feature fusion, noise and error will gradually accumulate. To address this
issue, we propose InsFusion, which can extract proposals from both raw and

mitigating the impact of accumulated errors. Additionally, by incorporating
attention mechanisms applied to the raw features, it thereby mitigates the
impact of accumulated errors. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that InsFusion is compatible with various advanced baseline methods and
delivers new state-of-the-art performance for 3D object detection.

Abstract: We propose a novel and general framework to disentangle video data into its
dynamic motion and static content components. Our proposed method is a
self-supervised pipeline with less assumptions and inductive biases than
previous works: it utilizes a transformer-based architecture to jointly
generate flexible implicit features for frame-wise motion and clip-wise
content, and incorporates a low-bitrate vector quantization as an information
bottleneck to promote disentanglement and form a meaningful discrete motion
space. The bitrate-controlled latent motion and content are used as conditional
inputs to a denoising diffusion model to facilitate self-supervised
representation learning. We validate our disentangled representation learning
framework on real-world talking head videos with motion transfer and
auto-regressive motion generation tasks. Furthermore, we also show that our
method can generalize to other types of video data, such as pixel sprites of 2D
cartoon characters. Our work presents a new perspective on self-supervised
learning of disentangled video representations, contributing to the broader
field of video analysis and generation.

Abstract: Vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction is a critical task in 3D vision
that integrates volumetric 3D reconstruction with semantic understanding.
Existing methods, however, often rely on modular pipelines. These modules are
typically optimized independently or use pre-configured inputs, leading to
cascading errors. In this paper, we address this limitation by designing a
novel causal loss that enables holistic, end-to-end supervision of the modular
2D-to-3D transformation pipeline. Grounded in the principle of 2D-to-3D
semantic causality, this loss regulates the gradient flow from 3D voxel
representations back to the 2D features. Consequently, it renders the entire
pipeline differentiable, unifying the learning process and making previously
non-trainable components fully learnable. Building on this principle, we
propose the Semantic Causality-Aware 2D-to-3D Transformation, which comprises
three components guided by our causal loss: Channel-Grouped Lifting for
adaptive semantic mapping, Learnable Camera Offsets for enhanced robustness
against camera perturbations, and Normalized Convolution for effective feature
propagation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Occ3D benchmark, demonstrating significant
robustness to camera perturbations and improved 2D-to-3D semantic consistency.

Motivation: 现实交通监控中，恶劣天气、光照不足或高速运动导致车辆图像存在严重噪声和模糊，特别是车牌区域较小的情况下，会显著降低车牌识别系统的准确性，需要实时图像增强作为预处理步骤

Method: 提出垂直残差自编码器(VRAE)架构，在编码阶段引入辅助块注入输入感知特征来指导表示学习过程，相比传统自编码器能更好地保持全局信息

Result: 在包含可见车牌的车牌图像数据集上，VRAE在相同深度下比自编码器PSNR提升约20%，NMSE降低约50%，SSIM提升1%，参数仅增加约1%，且优于GAN和基于流的方法

Conclusion: VRAE方法能有效提升交通监控图像质量，为车牌识别系统提供高质量的预处理图像，具有较好的实用价值和性能优势

Abstract: In real-world traffic surveillance, vehicle images captured under adverse
weather, poor lighting, or high-speed motion often suffer from severe noise and
blur. Such degradations significantly reduce the accuracy of license plate
recognition systems, especially when the plate occupies only a small region
within the full vehicle image. Restoring these degraded images a fast realtime
manner is thus a crucial pre-processing step to enhance recognition
performance. In this work, we propose a Vertical Residual Autoencoder (VRAE)
architecture designed for the image enhancement task in traffic surveillance.
The method incorporates an enhancement strategy that employs an auxiliary
block, which injects input-aware features at each encoding stage to guide the
representation learning process, enabling better general information
preservation throughout the network compared to conventional autoencoders.
Experiments on a vehicle image dataset with visible license plates demonstrate
that our method consistently outperforms Autoencoder (AE), Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN), and Flow-Based (FB) approaches. Compared with AE at
the same depth, it improves PSNR by about 20\%, reduces NMSE by around 50\%,
and enhances SSIM by 1\%, while requiring only a marginal increase of roughly
1\% in parameters.

Motivation: 多视角多目标跟踪(MVMOT)在监控、自动驾驶等领域很重要，但多视角之间的视角变化、光照异常和遮挡使得对象身份保持一致性很难。屏蔽上的BEV投影方法容易产生特征扭曲和密度不均问题，影响检测和跟踪准确性。

Method: 1. 稀疏变换：避免投影过程中的不自然插值
2. 密度感知加权：根据空间信心和相机距离自适应地融合特征
3. 多视角一致性损失：鼓励每个相机在融合前独立学习区分性特征

Conclusion: SCFusion有效减少了传统BEV投影方法的限制，为多视角对象检测和跟踪提供了稳健而准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-View Multi-Object Tracking (MVMOT) is essential for applications such
as surveillance, autonomous driving, and sports analytics. However, maintaining
consistent object identities across multiple cameras remains challenging due to
viewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions, which often lead to
tracking errors.Recent methods project features from multiple cameras into a
unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to improve robustness against occlusion.
However, this projection introduces feature distortion and non-uniform density
caused by variations in object scale with distance. These issues degrade the
quality of the fused representation and reduce detection and tracking
accuracy.To address these problems, we propose SCFusion, a framework that
combines three techniques to improve multi-view feature integration. First, it
applies a sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation during
projection. Next, it performs density-aware weighting to adaptively fuse
features based on spatial confidence and camera distance. Finally, it
introduces a multi-view consistency loss that encourages each camera to learn
discriminative features independently before fusion.Experiments show that
SCFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an IDF1 score of 95.9%
on WildTrack and a MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, outperforming the baseline
method TrackTacular. These results demonstrate that SCFusion effectively
mitigates the limitations of conventional BEV projection and provides a robust
and accurate solution for multi-view object detection and tracking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LD-ViCE是一个基于潜在扩散模型的视频反事实解释框架，通过在潜在空间中操作降低计算成本，同时生成真实可解释的反事实解释，在多个视频数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频AI系统在安全关键领域应用日益广泛，但现有解释技术存在时间连贯性不足、鲁棒性差、缺乏因果洞察等问题，需要开发更有效的解释方法。

Method: 使用最先进的扩散模型在潜在空间中操作，通过额外的精炼步骤生成现实且可解释的反事实解释，显著降低计算成本。

Result: 在三个不同视频数据集上验证有效性，R2分数提升高达68%，推理时间减少一半，定性分析确认生成语义有意义且时间连贯的解释。

Conclusion: LD-ViCE代表了在安全关键领域可信AI部署的重要进展，为理解视频AI模型行为提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Video-based AI systems are increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains
such as autonomous driving and healthcare. However, interpreting their
decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of
video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation
techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient
robustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual
explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target
model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent
Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework
designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous
approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations
by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while
producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional
refinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE
across three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac
ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action
recognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving
an increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half.
Qualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful
and temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the
target model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the
trustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了HyperTTA框架，通过多退化高光谱数据集、光谱空间Transformer分类器和轻量级测试时自适应策略，显著提升了高光谱图像分类模型在各种退化条件下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分类模型对噪声、模糊、压缩和大气效应等现实世界退化引起的分布偏移高度敏感，需要提高模型在各种退化条件下的鲁棒性。

Method: 1) 构建包含9种代表性退化的多退化高光谱数据集；2) 设计光谱空间Transformer分类器(SSTC)，采用多级感受野机制和标签平滑正则化；3) 提出置信度感知熵最小化LayerNorm适配器(CELA)，仅更新LayerNorm层的仿射参数。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，HyperTTA在各种退化场景下均优于现有基线方法，验证了其分类主干和TTA方案的有效性。

Conclusion: HyperTTA框架通过系统性的数据集构建、先进的分类器设计和轻量级自适应策略，成功提升了高光谱图像分类在退化条件下的鲁棒性能，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification models are highly sensitive to
distribution shifts caused by various real-world degradations such as noise,
blur, compression, and atmospheric effects. To address this challenge, we
propose HyperTTA, a unified framework designed to enhance model robustness
under diverse degradation conditions. Specifically, we first construct a
multi-degradation hyperspectral dataset that systematically simulates nine
representative types of degradations, providing a comprehensive benchmark for
robust classification evaluation. Based on this, we design a spectral-spatial
transformer classifier (SSTC) enhanced with a multi-level receptive field
mechanism and label smoothing regularization to jointly capture multi-scale
spatial context and improve generalization. Furthermore, HyperTTA incorporates
a lightweight test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy, the confidence-aware
entropy-minimized LayerNorm adapter (CELA), which updates only the affine
parameters of LayerNorm layers by minimizing prediction entropy on
high-confidence unlabeled target samples. This confidence-aware adaptation
prevents unreliable updates from noisy predictions, enabling robust and dynamic
adaptation without access to source data or target annotations. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperTTA outperforms
existing baselines across a wide range of degradation scenarios, validating the
effectiveness of both its classification backbone and the proposed TTA scheme.
Code will be made available publicly.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于球形布朗桥扩散模型(SBDM)的个性化皮层厚度轨迹预测方法，通过双向条件布朗桥扩散过程和条件球形U-Net架构，在ADNI和OASIS数据集上实现了显著降低的预测误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测个体化高分辨率皮层厚度轨迹对于检测细微皮层变化、理解神经退行性过程和实现早期精确干预至关重要，但由于大脑皮层的复杂非欧几何特性和多模态数据整合需求，这是一个具有挑战性的任务。

Method: 提出了球形布朗桥扩散模型(SBDM)，采用双向条件布朗桥扩散过程在配准皮层表面的顶点级别预测皮层厚度轨迹，并开发了条件球形U-Net(CoS-UNet)去噪模型，结合球形卷积和密集交叉注意力机制来无缝整合皮层表面和表格条件数据。

Result: 在ADNI和OASIS纵向数据集上的实验表明，与之前的方法相比，SBDM实现了显著降低的预测误差，并能够生成个体事实和反事实皮层厚度轨迹。

Conclusion: SBDM为探索皮层发育的假设情景提供了一个新颖框架，在皮层厚度预测方面表现出优越性能，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of individualized, high-resolution cortical thickness
(CTh) trajectories is essential for detecting subtle cortical changes,
providing invaluable insights into neurodegenerative processes and facilitating
earlier and more precise intervention strategies. However, CTh forecasting is a
challenging task due to the intricate non-Euclidean geometry of the cerebral
cortex and the need to integrate multi-modal data for subject-specific
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce the Spherical Brownian
Bridge Diffusion Model (SBDM). Specifically, we propose a bidirectional
conditional Brownian bridge diffusion process to forecast CTh trajectories at
the vertex level of registered cortical surfaces. Our technical contribution
includes a new denoising model, the conditional spherical U-Net (CoS-UNet),
which combines spherical convolutions and dense cross-attention to integrate
cortical surfaces and tabular conditions seamlessly. Compared to previous
approaches, SBDM achieves significantly reduced prediction errors, as
demonstrated by our experiments based on longitudinal datasets from the ADNI
and OASIS. Additionally, we demonstrate SBDM's ability to generate individual
factual and counterfactual CTh trajectories, offering a novel framework for
exploring hypothetical scenarios of cortical development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数Mamba基于视觉模型集中于网络架构和扫描路径，对状态空间模型模块本身关注不够，需要深入挖掘SSM的潜力

Method: 提出一阶状态空间模型(FSSM)，在SSM中应用一阶持有条件，派生新的离散化形式，并分析累积误差，通过添加token相关性来改善性能

Result: 在5个标准数据集上验证，FSSM在不增加参数的情况下显著提升了MambaIR的性能，超越了当前的轻量级SR方法，达到了state-of-the-art结果

Conclusion: 一阶状态空间模型(FSSM)通过改进SSM的计算过程有效提升了轻量级超分辨率任务的性能，为SSM在视觉任务中的深入应用提供了新的思路

Abstract: State space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have shown promise in NLP
tasks and are increasingly applied to vision tasks. However, most Mamba-based
vision models focus on network architecture and scan paths, with little
attention to the SSM module. In order to explore the potential of SSMs, we
modified the calculation process of SSM without increasing the number of
parameters to improve the performance on lightweight super-resolution tasks. In
this paper, we introduce the First-order State Space Model (FSSM) to improve
the original Mamba module, enhancing performance by incorporating token
correlations. We apply a first-order hold condition in SSMs, derive the new
discretized form, and analyzed cumulative error. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that FSSM improves the performance of MambaIR on five benchmark
datasets without additionally increasing the number of parameters, and
surpasses current lightweight SR methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 对比自监督学习在平衡数据集上表现良好，但在不平衡数据集上泛化能力不足。受Yann LeCun关于多视图框架的启发，作者希望扩展自监督学习到多于两个视图的情况，以解决数据集不平衡问题

Method: 基于互信息理论提出多于两个视图的目标函数，通过分离类内和类间判别特征来提取尾部类的代表性特征。引入新的损失函数来过滤极端特征，学习更好的表示

Result: 在多种自监督框架（对比和非对比）上验证了多视图目标在不平衡数据集上的有效性：Cifar10-LT提升2%（Resnet-18），Cifar100-LT提升5%（Resnet-18），Imagenet-LT提升3%（Resnet-50）

Conclusion: 多视图互信息方法能够有效解决自监督学习在不平衡数据集上的问题，通过提取尾部类特征和过滤极端特征，显著提升了分类精度，为自监督学习在不平衡数据上的应用提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: The robustness of contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL) for imbalanced
datasets is largely unexplored. CSSL usually makes use of \emph{multi-view}
assumptions to learn discriminatory features via similar and dissimilar data
samples. CSSL works well on balanced datasets, but does not generalize well for
imbalanced datasets. In a very recent paper, as part of future work, Yann LeCun
pointed out that the self-supervised multiview framework can be extended to
cases involving \emph{more than two views}. Taking a cue from this insight we
propose a theoretical justification based on the concept of \emph{mutual
information} to support the \emph{more than two views} objective and apply it
to the problem of dataset imbalance in self-supervised learning. The proposed
method helps extract representative characteristics of the tail classes by
segregating between \emph{intra} and \emph{inter} discriminatory
characteristics. We introduce a loss function that helps us to learn better
representations by filtering out extreme features. Experimental evaluation on a
variety of self-supervised frameworks (both contrastive and non-contrastive)
also prove that the \emph{more than two view} objective works well for
imbalanced datasets. We achieve a new state-of-the-art accuracy in
self-supervised imbalanced dataset classification (2\% improvement in
Cifar10-LT using Resnet-18, 5\% improvement in Cifar100-LT using Resnet-18, 3\%
improvement in Imagenet-LT (1k) using Resnet-50).

Abstract: Prompt-driven image analysis converts a single natural-language instruction
into multiple steps: locate, segment, edit, and describe. We present a
practical case study of a unified pipeline that combines open-vocabulary
detection, promptable segmentation, text-conditioned inpainting, and
vision-language description into a single workflow. The system works end to end
from a single prompt, retains intermediate artifacts for transparent debugging
(such as detections, masks, overlays, edited images, and before and after
composites), and provides the same functionality through an interactive UI and
a scriptable CLI for consistent, repeatable runs. We highlight integration
choices that reduce brittleness, including threshold adjustments, mask
inspection with light morphology, and resource-aware defaults. In a small,
single-word prompt segment, detection and segmentation produced usable masks in
over 90% of cases with an accuracy above 85% based on our criteria. On a
high-end GPU, inpainting makes up 60 to 75% of total runtime under typical
guidance and sampling settings, which highlights the need for careful tuning.
The study offers implementation-guided advice on thresholds, mask tightness,
and diffusion parameters, and details version pinning, artifact logging, and
seed control to support replay. Our contribution is a transparent, reliable
pattern for assembling modern vision and multimodal models behind a single
prompt, with clear guardrails and operational practices that improve
reliability in object replacement, scene augmentation, and removal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海底物体检测对海洋研究、潜水机器人等领域至关重要，但现有方法无法充分应对海底环境的复杂性。需要系统分析挑战并探索更有效的解决方案。

Method: 将海底物体检测挑战系统分为五大类别：图像质量逍化、目标相关问题、数据挑战、计算处理约束和检测方法限制。分析了从传统到现代方法的进化，探索大视觉-语言模型的应甦潜力，并通过DALL-E 3生成合成数据集和微调Florence-2模型进行案例研究。

Result: 获得三个关键见解：(i)现有方法在动态海底环境中对图像逍化和小物体检测的处理不充分；(ii)LVLMs生成合成数据具有潜力但需提高实际性；(iii)LVLMs在海底检测中展示了广阔前景，但实时应甦仍需深入研究。

Conclusion: 大视觉-语言模型为海底物体检测带来了新的机遇，特别是在合成数据生成和多模态处理方面。但需要进一步优化模型以满足实时应甦需求，并提高合成数据的真实性和适用性。

Abstract: Underwater object detection (UOD) is vital to diverse marine applications,
including oceanographic research, underwater robotics, and marine conservation.
However, UOD faces numerous challenges that compromise its performance. Over
the years, various methods have been proposed to address these issues, but they
often fail to fully capture the complexities of underwater environments. This
review systematically categorizes UOD challenges into five key areas: Image
quality degradation, target-related issues, data-related challenges,
computational and processing constraints, and limitations in detection
methodologies. To address these challenges, we analyze the progression from
traditional image processing and object detection techniques to modern
approaches. Additionally, we explore the potential of large vision-language
models (LVLMs) in UOD, leveraging their multi-modal capabilities demonstrated
in other domains. We also present case studies, including synthetic dataset
generation using DALL-E 3 and fine-tuning Florence-2 LVLM for UOD. This review
identifies three key insights: (i) Current UOD methods are insufficient to
fully address challenges like image degradation and small object detection in
dynamic underwater environments. (ii) Synthetic data generation using LVLMs
shows potential for augmenting datasets but requires further refinement to
ensure realism and applicability. (iii) LVLMs hold significant promise for UOD,
but their real-time application remains under-explored, requiring further
research on optimization techniques.

Motivation: 开发对时间视觉变化敏感的紧凑视频表征，解决现有视频嵌入表征在双向动作（如打开/关闭门）识别中表现差的问题。

Method: 提出自监督监督的适配方法，在冻结的图像特征序列上注入时间敏感性。采用受感矩直化启发的自编码器潜在空间设计。

Result: 在Something-Something、EPIC-Kitchens和Charade三个数据集上表现优异，超过大规模视频模型，并能提升现有模型在标准分类任务上的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成紧凑但对时间变化敏感的视频表征，在双向动作识别中表现突出，为视频理解提供了有效的时间敏感性注入方案。

Abstract: Our objective is to develop compact video representations that are sensitive
to visual change over time. To measure such time-sensitivity, we introduce a
new task: chiral action recognition, where one needs to distinguish between a
pair of temporally opposite actions, such as "opening vs. closing a door",
"approaching vs. moving away from something", "folding vs. unfolding paper",
etc. Such actions (i) occur frequently in everyday life, (ii) require
understanding of simple visual change over time (in object state, size, spatial
position, count . . . ), and (iii) are known to be poorly represented by many
video embeddings. Our goal is to build time aware video representations which
offer linear separability between these chiral pairs. To that end, we propose a
self-supervised adaptation recipe to inject time-sensitivity into a sequence of
frozen image features. Our model is based on an auto-encoder with a latent
space with inductive bias inspired by perceptual straightening. We show that
this results in a compact but time-sensitive video representation for the
proposed task across three datasets: Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and
Charade. Our method (i) outperforms much larger video models pre-trained on
large-scale video datasets, and (ii) leads to an improvement in classification
performance on standard benchmarks when combined with these existing models.

Abstract: Human-Centric Video Generation (HCVG) methods seek to synthesize human videos
from multimodal inputs, including text, image, and audio. Existing methods
struggle to effectively coordinate these heterogeneous modalities due to two
challenges: the scarcity of training data with paired triplet conditions and
the difficulty of collaborating the sub-tasks of subject preservation and
audio-visual sync with multimodal inputs. In this work, we present HuMo, a
unified HCVG framework for collaborative multimodal control. For the first
challenge, we construct a high-quality dataset with diverse and paired text,
reference images, and audio. For the second challenge, we propose a two-stage
progressive multimodal training paradigm with task-specific strategies. For the
subject preservation task, to maintain the prompt following and visual
generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt the minimal-invasive
image injection strategy. For the audio-visual sync task, besides the commonly
adopted audio cross-attention layer, we propose a focus-by-predicting strategy
that implicitly guides the model to associate audio with facial regions. For
joint learning of controllabilities across multimodal inputs, building on
previously acquired capabilities, we progressively incorporate the audio-visual
sync task. During inference, for flexible and fine-grained multimodal control,
we design a time-adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance strategy that dynamically
adjusts guidance weights across denoising steps. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that HuMo surpasses specialized state-of-the-art methods in
sub-tasks, establishing a unified framework for collaborative
multimodal-conditioned HCVG. Project Page:

Method: 使用问答框架（二元和多选题），包含目标和陷阱实例，采用自下而上方法评估基础对象、粗到细的主体特征以及主体-动作对

Result: LVMs在识别基础对象和特征方面表现优秀，但在处理精细细节或对齐涉及多个主体的多个动作时，幻觉敏感性显著增加

Conclusion: MESH提供了一个有效且全面的方法来识别视频中的幻觉，揭示了LVMs在复杂场景中的局限性

Abstract: Large Video Models (LVMs) build on the semantic capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) and vision modules by integrating temporal information
to better understand dynamic video content. Despite their progress, LVMs are
prone to hallucinations-producing inaccurate or irrelevant descriptions.
Current benchmarks for video hallucination depend heavily on manual
categorization of video content, neglecting the perception-based processes
through which humans naturally interpret videos. We introduce MESH, a benchmark
designed to evaluate hallucinations in LVMs systematically. MESH uses a
Question-Answering framework with binary and multi-choice formats incorporating
target and trap instances. It follows a bottom-up approach, evaluating basic
objects, coarse-to-fine subject features, and subject-action pairs, aligning
with human video understanding. We demonstrate that MESH offers an effective
and comprehensive approach for identifying hallucinations in videos. Our
evaluations show that while LVMs excel at recognizing basic objects and
features, their susceptibility to hallucinations increases markedly when
handling fine details or aligning multiple actions involving various subjects
in longer videos.

Motivation: 传统单视角分类或回归方法无法充分捕捉植物表型特征的所有信息，影响植物健康评估和收获预测的准确性

Method: 使用多视角数据集，引入24个视角的选择向量进行随机选择来学习视角不变嵌入，并尝试了120个视角的选择矩阵进行随机视角选择

Result: ViewSparsifier方法在植物年龄预测和叶片计数估计两个任务中都获得了最佳性能

Conclusion: 多视角学习方法能有效提升植物表型分析的准确性，随机视角选择策略是未来研究的有前景方向

Abstract: Plant phenotyping involves analyzing observable characteristics of plants to
better understand their growth, health, and development. In the context of deep
learning, this analysis is often approached through single-view classification
or regression models. However, these methods often fail to capture all
information required for accurate estimation of target phenotypic traits, which
can adversely affect plant health assessment and harvest readiness prediction.
To address this, the Growth Modelling (GroMo) Grand Challenge at ACM Multimedia
2025 provides a multi-view dataset featuring multiple plants and two tasks:
Plant Age Prediction and Leaf Count Estimation. Each plant is photographed from
multiple heights and angles, leading to significant overlap and redundancy in
the captured information. To learn view-invariant embeddings, we incorporate 24
views, referred to as the selection vector, in a random selection. Our
ViewSparsifier approach won both tasks. For further improvement and as a
direction for future research, we also experimented with randomized view
selection across all five height levels (120 views total), referred to as
selection matrices.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的多模态医学图像分割方法，通过EM聚合机制和文本导向像素解码器解决了多模态融合中的语义间隔和特征分散问题，在心脏和眼底数据集上达到了独创性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态模型在自然图像分割中表现出色，但在医学领域应用中性能不佳。访问发现这主要因为抽象文本提示与细粒度医学视觉特征之间存在显著的语义间隔，以及由此导致的特征分散问题。

Method: 从语义聚合角度出发，提出了期望最大化(EM)聚合机制和文本导向像素解码器。EM聚合通过动态聚类特征到紧凑的语义中心来减少特征分散，增强跨模态对应性。文本导向像素解码器利用域不变的文本知识来指导深度视觉表征，缩小语义间隔。

Result: 在公开的心脏和眼底数据集上进行了大量实验，结果表明该方法在多个域适应性测试中一贯地超越了现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过EM聚合机制和文本导向像素解码器的协同作用，显著提升了模型的沿半径适应能力，有效解决了医学图像分割中的多模态融合挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal models have achieved remarkable success in natural image
segmentation, yet they often underperform when applied to the medical domain.
Through extensive study, we attribute this performance gap to the challenges of
multimodal fusion, primarily the significant semantic gap between abstract
textual prompts and fine-grained medical visual features, as well as the
resulting feature dispersion. To address these issues, we revisit the problem
from the perspective of semantic aggregation. Specifically, we propose an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) Aggregation mechanism and a Text-Guided Pixel
Decoder. The former mitigates feature dispersion by dynamically clustering
features into compact semantic centers to enhance cross-modal correspondence.
The latter is designed to bridge the semantic gap by leveraging
domain-invariant textual knowledge to effectively guide deep visual
representations. The synergy between these two mechanisms significantly
improves the model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments on public
cardiac and fundus datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing SOTA approaches across multiple domain generalization
benchmarks.

gradient features and polynomial trends to capture both local variability and
broad structure. To handle data gaps, we employ a hybrid loss that combines
confidence-weighted radar supervision with dynamically balanced regularization.
Applied to three Greenland subregions, GraphTopoNet outperforms interpolation,
convolutional, and graph-based baselines, reducing error by up to 60 percent
while preserving fine-scale glacial features. The resulting bed maps improve
reliability for operational modeling, supporting agencies engaged in climate
forecasting and policy. More broadly, GraphTopoNet shows how graph machine
learning can convert sparse, uncertain geophysical observations into actionable
knowledge at continental scale.

Motivation: 减轻医学专业人员在3D分割任务中的手动工作量，特别是在放疗规划和退行性疾病诊断中，这些任务目前无法完全自动化

Method: 引入隐式形状先验从稀疏切片手动标注中分割体积，扩展到多器官情况，并提供自动选择最具信息量切片的框架来指导最小化后续交互

Conclusion: 该方法能显著减少医学3D分割任务中的人工工作量，在放疗规划和肌少症诊断等应用中具有实用价值

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to significantly reduce the manual workload
required from medical professionals in complex 3D segmentation tasks that
cannot be yet fully automated. For instance, in radiotherapy planning, organs
at risk must be accurately identified in computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scans to ensure they are spared from harmful radiation.
Similarly, diagnosing age-related degenerative diseases such as sarcopenia,
which involve progressive muscle volume loss and strength, is commonly based on
muscular mass measurements often obtained from manual segmentation of medical
volumes. To alleviate the manual-segmentation burden, this paper introduces an
implicit shape prior to segment volumes from sparse slice manual annotations
generalized to the multi-organ case, along with a simple framework for
automatically selecting the most informative slices to guide and minimize the
next interactions. The experimental validation shows the method's effectiveness
on two medical use cases: assisted segmentation in the context of at risks
organs for brain cancer patients, and acceleration of the creation of a new
database with unseen muscle shapes for patients with sarcopenia.

Abstract: With imaging devices delivering ever-higher resolutions and the emerging
diffusion-based forgery methods, current detectors trained only on traditional
datasets (with splicing, copy-moving and object removal forgeries) lack
exposure to this new manipulation type. To address this, we propose a novel
high-resolution SIF dataset of 1200+ diffusion-generated manipulations with
semantically extracted masks. However, this also imposes a challenge on
existing methods, as they face significant computational resource constraints
due to their prohibitive computational complexities. Therefore, we propose a
novel EfficientIML model with a lightweight, three-stage EfficientRWKV
backbone. EfficientRWKV's hybrid state-space and attention network captures
global context and local details in parallel, while a multi-scale supervision
strategy enforces consistency across hierarchical predictions. Extensive
evaluations on our dataset and standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach outperforms ViT-based and other SOTA lightweight baselines in
localization performance, FLOPs and inference speed, underscoring its
suitability for real-time forensic applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), have significantly impacted medical image segmentation, especially in
retinal imaging, where precise segmentation is vital for diagnosis. Despite
this progress, current methods face critical challenges: 1) modality ambiguity
in textual disease descriptions, 2) a continued reliance on manual prompting
for SAM-based workflows, and 3) a lack of a unified framework, with most
methods being modality- and task-specific. To overcome these hurdles, we
propose CLIP-unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation (\CLAPS), a novel method for
unified segmentation across diverse tasks and modalities in retinal imaging.
Our approach begins by pre-training a CLIP-based image encoder on a large,
multi-modal retinal dataset to handle data scarcity and distribution imbalance.
We then leverage GroundingDINO to automatically generate spatial bounding box
prompts by detecting local lesions. To unify tasks and resolve ambiguity, we
use text prompts enhanced with a unique "modality signature" for each imaging
modality. Ultimately, these automated textual and spatial prompts guide SAM to
execute precise segmentation, creating a fully automated and unified pipeline.
Extensive experiments on 12 diverse datasets across 11 critical segmentation
categories show that CLAPS achieves performance on par with specialized expert
models while surpassing existing benchmarks across most metrics, demonstrating
its broad generalizability as a foundation model.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have taken a great step towards AGI. Meanwhile,
an increasing number of domain-specific problems such as math and programming
boost these general-purpose models to continuously evolve via learning deeper
expertise. Now is thus the time further to extend the diversity of specialized
applications for knowledgeable LLMs, though collecting high quality data with
unexpected and informative tasks is challenging. In this paper, we propose to
use advertisement (ad) videos as a challenging test-bed to probe the ability of
LLMs in perceiving beyond the objective physical content of common visual
domain. Our motivation is to take full advantage of the clue-rich and
information-dense ad videos' traits, e.g., marketing logic, persuasive
strategies, and audience engagement. Our contribution is three-fold: (1) To our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to use ad videos with well-designed tasks
to evaluate LLMs. We contribute AdsQA, a challenging ad Video QA benchmark
derived from 1,544 ad videos with 10,962 clips, totaling 22.7 hours, providing
5 challenging tasks. (2) We propose ReAd-R, a Deepseek-R1 styled RL model that
reflects on questions, and generates answers via reward-driven optimization.
(3) We benchmark 14 top-tier LLMs on AdsQA, and our \texttt{ReAd-R}~achieves
the state-of-the-art outperforming strong competitors equipped with long-chain

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决多模态眼科图像数据不平衡问题，通过OCT空间前知提升了仅使用本底照的疾病识别性能

Abstract: Significant advancements in AI-driven multimodal medical image diagnosis have
led to substantial improvements in ophthalmic disease identification in recent
years. However, acquiring paired multimodal ophthalmic images remains
prohibitively expensive. While fundus photography is simple and cost-effective,
the limited availability of OCT data and inherent modality imbalance hinder
further progress. Conventional approaches that rely solely on fundus or textual
features often fail to capture fine-grained spatial information, as each
imaging modality provides distinct cues about lesion predilection sites. In
this study, we propose a novel unpaired multimodal framework \UOPSL that
utilizes extensive OCT-derived spatial priors to dynamically identify
predilection sites, enhancing fundus image-based disease recognition. Our
approach bridges unpaired fundus and OCTs via extended disease text
descriptions. Initially, we employ contrastive learning on a large corpus of
unpaired OCT and fundus images while simultaneously learning the predilection
sites matrix in the OCT latent space. Through extensive optimization, this
matrix captures lesion localization patterns within the OCT feature space.
During the fine-tuning or inference phase of the downstream classification task
based solely on fundus images, where paired OCT data is unavailable, we
eliminate OCT input and utilize the predilection sites matrix to assist in
fundus image classification learning. Extensive experiments conducted on 9
diverse datasets across 28 critical categories demonstrate that our framework
outperforms existing benchmarks.

Result: 在部分监督下的深度到图像转换任务中表现出优越性能，能够处理多源转换（深度图和分割掩码）和多目标转换的类条件风格迁移任务。

Conclusion: LADB为现实世界域转换提供了一个可扩展且通用的解决方案，特别适用于数据标注成本高或不完整的场景。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality outputs but face challenges
in data-scarce domains, where exhaustive retraining or costly paired data are
often required. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Aligned
Diffusion Bridges (LADB), a semi-supervised framework for sample-to-sample
translation that effectively bridges domain gaps using partially paired data.
By aligning source and target distributions within a shared latent space, LADB
seamlessly integrates pretrained source-domain diffusion models with a
target-domain Latent Aligned Diffusion Model (LADM), trained on partially
paired latent representations. This approach enables deterministic domain
mapping without the need for full supervision. Compared to unpaired methods,
which often lack controllability, and fully paired approaches that require
large, domain-specific datasets, LADB strikes a balance between fidelity and
diversity by leveraging a mixture of paired and unpaired latent-target
couplings. Our experimental results demonstrate superior performance in
depth-to-image translation under partial supervision. Furthermore, we extend
LADB to handle multi-source translation (from depth maps and segmentation
masks) and multi-target translation in a class-conditioned style transfer task,
showcasing its versatility in handling diverse and heterogeneous use cases.
Ultimately, we present LADB as a scalable and versatile solution for real-world
domain translation, particularly in scenarios where data annotation is costly
or incomplete.

Conclusion: DSLNet通过解耦手势形态和轨迹建模，有效解决了孤立手语识别中的几何模糊问题，在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) is challenged by gestures that are
morphologically similar yet semantically distinct, a problem rooted in the
complex interplay between hand shape and motion trajectory. Existing methods,
often relying on a single reference frame, struggle to resolve this geometric
ambiguity. This paper introduces Dual-SignLanguageNet (DSLNet), a
dual-reference, dual-stream architecture that decouples and models gesture
morphology and trajectory in separate, complementary coordinate systems. Our
approach utilizes a wrist-centric frame for view-invariant shape analysis and a
facial-centric frame for context-aware trajectory modeling. These streams are
processed by specialized networks-a topology-aware graph convolution for shape
and a Finsler geometry-based encoder for trajectory-and are integrated via a
geometry-driven optimal transport fusion mechanism. DSLNet sets a new
state-of-the-art, achieving 93.70%, 89.97% and 99.79% accuracy on the
challenging WLASL-100, WLASL-300 and LSA64 datasets, respectively, with
significantly fewer parameters than competing models.

Motivation: 传统光流估计方法需要大量标注数据，而真实标注数据获取困难且成本高。本文旨在开发一个无需真实标注的无监督框架，能够直接从连续帧中学习准确的光流估计。

Method: 采用分形变形网络（FDN）架构，基于分形几何和自相似性设计递归编码器-解码器结构，使用总变差正则化的变分公式作为训练目标，结合L1和L2数据保真度项来保证亮度恒定性和空间平滑性。

Result: 在合成和基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够生成准确、平滑且保持边缘细节的光流场，特别在高分辨率数据和标注有限场景下表现优异。

Conclusion: FractalPINN-Flow提供了一个有效的无监督光流估计解决方案，通过分形网络架构和变分正则化方法，在无需真实标注的情况下实现了高质量的光流估计性能。

Abstract: We present FractalPINN-Flow, an unsupervised deep learning framework for
dense optical flow estimation that learns directly from consecutive grayscale
frames without requiring ground truth. The architecture centers on the Fractal
Deformation Network (FDN) - a recursive encoder-decoder inspired by fractal
geometry and self-similarity. Unlike traditional CNNs with sequential
downsampling, FDN uses repeated encoder-decoder nesting with skip connections
to capture both fine-grained details and long-range motion patterns. The
training objective is based on a classical variational formulation using total
variation (TV) regularization. Specifically, we minimize an energy functional
that combines $L^1$ and $L^2$ data fidelity terms to enforce brightness
constancy, along with a TV term that promotes spatial smoothness and coherent
flow fields. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets show that
FractalPINN-Flow produces accurate, smooth, and edge-preserving optical flow
fields. The model is especially effective for high-resolution data and
scenarios with limited annotations.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive survey of computational imaging (CI)
techniques and their transformative impact on computer vision (CV)
applications. Conventional imaging methods often fail to deliver high-fidelity

reconstruction processes. This survey systematically explores the synergies
between CI techniques and core CV tasks, including object detection, depth

analyzing the relationships between CI methods and their practical
contributions to CV applications, this work highlights emerging opportunities,
challenges, and future research directions. We emphasize the potential for
task-specific, adaptive imaging pipelines that improve robustness, accuracy,

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance, their large-scale
architectures pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained
environments. In the age of large models, where energy efficiency,
computational scalability and environmental sustainability are paramount, the
development of lightweight and high-performance models is critical for
real-world applications. As such, we propose a lightweight MLLM framework for
end-to-end visual question answering. Our proposed approach centres on
BreezeCLIP, a compact yet powerful vision-language encoder optimised for
efficient multimodal understanding. With only 1.2 billion parameters overall,
our model significantly reduces computational cost while achieving performance
comparable to standard-size MLLMs. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets
further validate its effectiveness in balancing accuracy and efficiency. The
modular and extensible design enables generalisation to broader multimodal
tasks. The proposed lightweight vision-language framework is denoted as BcQLM
(BreezeCLIP-enhanced Q-Gated Multimodal Language Model). It offers a promising
path toward deployable MLLMs under practical hardware constraints. The source

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for end-to-end crowd detection that
leverages object density information to enhance existing transformer-based
detectors. We present CrowdQuery (CQ), whose core component is our CQ module
that predicts and subsequently embeds an object density map. The embedded
density information is then systematically integrated into the decoder.
Existing density map definitions typically depend on head positions or
object-based spatial statistics. Our method extends these definitions to
include individual bounding box dimensions. By incorporating density
information into object queries, our method utilizes density-guided queries to
improve detection in crowded scenes. CQ is universally applicable to both 2D
and 3D detection without requiring additional data. Consequently, we are the
first to design a method that effectively bridges 2D and 3D detection in
crowded environments. We demonstrate the integration of CQ into both a general
2D and 3D transformer-based object detector, introducing the architectures CQ2D
and CQ3D. CQ is not limited to the specific transformer models we selected.
Experiments on the STCrowd dataset for both 2D and 3D domains show significant
performance improvements compared to the base models, outperforming most
state-of-the-art methods. When integrated into a state-of-the-art crowd
detector, CQ can further improve performance on the challenging CrowdHuman
dataset, demonstrating its generalizability. The code is released at

Conclusion: ArgoTweak为可解释的先验辅助高精地图建立了基准，推动了可扩展、自改进的地图解决方案发展。

Abstract: Reliable integration of prior information is crucial for self-verifying and
self-updating HD maps. However, no public dataset includes the required triplet
of prior maps, current maps, and sensor data. As a result, existing methods
must rely on synthetic priors, which create inconsistencies and lead to a
significant sim2real gap. To address this, we introduce ArgoTweak, the first
dataset to complete the triplet with realistic map priors. At its core,
ArgoTweak employs a bijective mapping framework, breaking down large-scale
modifications into fine-grained atomic changes at the map element level, thus
ensuring interpretability. This paradigm shift enables accurate change
detection and integration while preserving unchanged elements with high
fidelity. Experiments show that training models on ArgoTweak significantly
reduces the sim2real gap compared to synthetic priors. Extensive ablations
further highlight the impact of structured priors and detailed change
annotations. By establishing a benchmark for explainable, prior-aided HD
mapping, ArgoTweak advances scalable, self-improving mapping solutions. The
dataset, baselines, map modification toolbox, and further resources are

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在评估文本到图像生成系统时存在偏见、过份自信和不一致性问题，而标准的提示集成方法在多模态任务中效果不佳。

Method: 提出多模态注意力贝叶斯提示集成方法(MMB)，结合图像聚类技术，让模型能够根据每个样本的视觉特征动态分配提示权重。

Result: 在HPSv2和MJBench两个TTI测试集上，MMB方法在对比偏好判断中提高了准确性，大大增强了检验准确性，在与人工注释的对齐度和不同图像内容的检验性方面超过了现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了多模态特定策略对于评估模型检验的重要性，为可靠的大规模TTI评估指明了前进方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate
text-to-image (TTI) generation systems, providing automated judgments based on
visual and textual context. However, these "judge" models often suffer from
biases, overconfidence, and inconsistent performance across diverse image
domains. While prompt ensembling has shown promise for mitigating these issues
in unimodal, text-only settings, our experiments reveal that standard
ensembling methods fail to generalize effectively for TTI tasks. To address
these limitations, we propose a new multimodal-aware method called Multimodal
Mixture-of-Bayesian Prompt Ensembles (MMB). Our method uses a Bayesian prompt
ensemble approach augmented by image clustering, allowing the judge to
dynamically assign prompt weights based on the visual characteristics of each
sample. We show that MMB improves accuracy in pairwise preference judgments and
greatly enhances calibration, making it easier to gauge the judge's true
uncertainty. In evaluations on two TTI benchmarks, HPSv2 and MJBench, MMB
outperforms existing baselines in alignment with human annotations and
calibration across varied image content. Our findings highlight the importance
of multimodal-specific strategies for judge calibration and suggest a promising
path forward for reliable large-scale TTI evaluation.

Abstract: Background: Arsenicosis is a serious public health concern in South and
Southeast Asia, primarily caused by long-term consumption of
arsenic-contaminated water. Its early cutaneous manifestations are clinically
significant but often underdiagnosed, particularly in rural areas with limited
access to dermatologists. Automated, image-based diagnostic solutions can
support early detection and timely interventions.
  Methods: In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework for arsenicosis
diagnosis using mobile phone-captured skin images. A dataset comprising 20
classes and over 11000 images of arsenic-induced and other dermatological
conditions was curated. Multiple deep learning architectures, including
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, were
benchmarked for arsenicosis detection. Model interpretability was integrated
via LIME and Grad-CAM, while deployment feasibility was demonstrated through a
web-based diagnostic tool.
  Results: Transformer-based models significantly outperformed CNNs, with the
Swin Transformer achieving the best results (86\\% accuracy). LIME and Grad-CAM
visualizations confirmed that the models attended to lesion-relevant regions,
increasing clinical transparency and aiding in error analysis. The framework
also demonstrated strong performance on external validation samples, confirming
its ability to generalize beyond the curated dataset.
  Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of deep
learning for non-invasive, accessible, and explainable diagnosis of arsenicosis
from mobile-acquired images. By enabling reliable image-based screening, it can
serve as a practical diagnostic aid in rural and resource-limited communities,
where access to dermatologists is scarce, thereby supporting early detection
and timely intervention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的研究难以确定事件相机在真实数据中的准确真实值，需要一种可靠的方法来量化事件相机星迹踪系统的精度。

Method: 通过将静止事件相机指向夜空，使得相机在天球参考系中的唯一运动是由地球自转引起。将事件流处理生成方向估计，与国际地球自转参考系统(IERS)测量的地球方向进行对比。

Result: 事件相机系统达到了平均欧几里得误差18.47秒和绝对误差78.84秒的精度。

Conclusion: 结合事件相机相比帧率传感器的其他优势（更稀疏的数据流、更高动态范围、更低能消耗、更快更新率），这种精度水平表明事件相机在低成本低延迟星迹踪中具有应用价值。

Abstract: Event-based cameras (EBCs) are a promising new technology for star
tracking-based attitude determination, but prior studies have struggled to
determine accurate ground truth for real data. We analyze the accuracy of an
EBC star tracking system utilizing the Earth's motion as the ground truth for
comparison. The Earth rotates in a regular way with very small irregularities
which are measured to the level of milli-arcseconds. By keeping an event camera
static and pointing it through a ground-based telescope at the night sky, we
create a system where the only camera motion in the celestial reference frame
is that induced by the Earth's rotation. The resulting event stream is
processed to generate estimates of orientation which we compare to the
International Earth Rotation and Reference System (IERS) measured orientation
of the Earth. The event camera system is able to achieve a root mean squared
across error of 18.47 arcseconds and an about error of 78.84 arcseconds.
Combined with the other benefits of event cameras over framing sensors (reduced
computation due to sparser data streams, higher dynamic range, lower energy
consumption, faster update rates), this level of accuracy suggests the utility
of event cameras for low-cost and low-latency star tracking. We provide all
code and data used to generate our results:

TL;DR: BEAMER提出了一种新的密集图像匹配方法，通过在每个尺度为每个源位置预测多个对应假设，而不是单一假设，提高了在深度不连续和强缩放情况下的匹配鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集匹配方法在每个尺度为每个源位置只产生单一对应假设，在深度不连续或目标图像是源图像的强缩放时，相邻源位置的对应点可能分布广泛，单一假设容易导致错误匹配。

Method: 采用beam search策略在每个尺度传播多个假设，并将这些多假设集成到交叉注意力层中，构建了BEAMER架构，学习在跨尺度时保留和传播多个假设。

Result: BEAMER相比现有最先进方法显著提高了鲁棒性，特别是在深度不连续和目标图像是源图像强缩放的情况下表现更好。

Conclusion: 通过在每个尺度预测和传播多个对应假设，BEAMER架构能够更有效地处理密集图像匹配中的挑战性情况，为密集匹配任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Dense image matching aims to find a correspondent for every pixel of a source
image in a partially overlapping target image. State-of-the-art methods
typically rely on a coarse-to-fine mechanism where a single correspondent
hypothesis is produced per source location at each scale. In challenging cases
-- such as at depth discontinuities or when the target image is a strong
zoom-in of the source image -- the correspondents of neighboring source
locations are often widely spread and predicting a single correspondent
hypothesis per source location at each scale may lead to erroneous matches. In
this paper, we investigate the idea of predicting multiple correspondent
hypotheses per source location at each scale instead. We consider a beam search
strategy to propagat multiple hypotheses at each scale and propose integrating
these multiple hypotheses into cross-attention layers, resulting in a novel
dense matching architecture called BEAMER. BEAMER learns to preserve and
propagate multiple hypotheses across scales, making it significantly more
robust than state-of-the-art methods, especially at depth discontinuities or
when the target image is a strong zoom-in of the source image.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概率生成模型虽然能够进行文本驱动的视频生成，但其固有的随机性会导致不可预测的伪影，如不可能的物理现象和时间不一致性。由于视频的时空复杂性，现有数据集主要关注图像生成，缺乏专门针对视频生成伪影的系统性基准。

Method: 构建GeneVA数据集，包含大规模的视频样本和丰富的人工标注，专门关注从自然文本提示生成的视频中的时空伪影问题。

Result: GeneVA数据集填补了视频生成伪影评估的空白，为系统性地评估模型性能和提升生成视频质量提供了重要资源。

Conclusion: GeneVA数据集能够支持和辅助关键应用，如基准测试模型性能和改进生成视频质量，推动视频生成技术的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in probabilistic generative models have extended capabilities
from static image synthesis to text-driven video generation. However, the
inherent randomness of their generation process can lead to unpredictable
artifacts, such as impossible physics and temporal inconsistency. Progress in
addressing these challenges requires systematic benchmarks, yet existing
datasets primarily focus on generative images due to the unique spatio-temporal
complexities of videos. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeneVA, a large-scale
artifact dataset with rich human annotations that focuses on spatio-temporal
artifacts in videos generated from natural text prompts. We hope GeneVA can
enable and assist critical applications, such as benchmarking model performance
and improving generative video quality.

Conclusion: RewardDance成功解决了视觉生成奖励模型的扩展难题和奖励黑客问题，通过生成式奖励范式实现了模型和上下文两个维度的有效扩展，显著缓解了模式崩溃问题。

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are critical for improving generation models via
Reinforcement Learning (RL), yet the RM scaling paradigm in visual generation
remains largely unexplored. It primarily due to fundamental limitations in
existing approaches: CLIP-based RMs suffer from architectural and input
modality constraints, while prevalent Bradley-Terry losses are fundamentally
misaligned with the next-token prediction mechanism of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), hindering effective scaling. More critically, the RLHF optimization
process is plagued by Reward Hacking issue, where models exploit flaws in the
reward signal without improving true quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce RewardDance, a scalable reward modeling framework that overcomes
these barriers through a novel generative reward paradigm. By reformulating the
reward score as the model's probability of predicting a "yes" token, indicating
that the generated image outperforms a reference image according to specific
criteria, RewardDance intrinsically aligns reward objectives with VLM
architectures. This alignment unlocks scaling across two dimensions: (1) Model
Scaling: Systematic scaling of RMs up to 26 billion parameters; (2) Context
Scaling: Integration of task-specific instructions, reference examples, and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image,
text-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Crucially, we resolve the
persistent challenge of "reward hacking": Our large-scale RMs exhibit and
maintain high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, proving their resistance
to hacking and ability to produce diverse, high-quality outputs. It greatly
relieves the mode collapse problem that plagues smaller models.

Abstract: The reconstruction of three-dimensional dynamic scenes is a well-established
yet challenging task within the domain of computer vision. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach that combines the domains of 3D geometry
reconstruction and appearance estimation for physically based rendering and
present a system that is able to perform both tasks for fabrics, utilizing only
a single monocular RGB video sequence as input. In order to obtain realistic
and high-quality deformations and renderings, a physical simulation of the
cloth geometry and differentiable rendering are employed. In this paper, we
introduce two novel regularization terms for the 3D reconstruction task that
improve the plausibility of the reconstruction by addressing the depth
ambiguity problem in monocular video. In comparison with the most recent
methods in the field, we have reduced the error in the 3D reconstruction by a
factor of 2.64 while requiring a medium runtime of 30 min per scene.
Furthermore, the optimized motion achieves sufficient quality to perform an
appearance estimation of the deforming object, recovering sharp details from
this single monocular RGB video.
