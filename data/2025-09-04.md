Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has drawn tremendous attention recently. Many
works focus on using modular deep neural networks to construct the end-to-end
archi-tecture. However, whether using powerful large language models (LLM),
especially multi-modality Vision Language Models (VLM) could benefit the
end-to-end driving tasks remain a question. In our work, we demonstrate that
combining end-to-end architectural design and knowledgeable VLMs yield
impressive performance on the driving tasks. It is worth noting that our method
only uses a single camera and is the best camera-only solution across the
leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of vision-based driving approach
and the potential for end-to-end driving tasks.

### [2] [PixFoundation 2.0: Do Video Multi-Modal LLMs Use Motion in Visual Grounding?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02807)
*Mennatullah Siam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究多模态大语言模型在视频中的像素级视觉基准能力，特别是识别物体运动模式的能力，并提出了专门考虑运动特征的新测评标准MoCentric-Bench。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 提出四种以运动为中心的探测技术，用于研究视频MLLMs识别真实运动和理解运动顺序的能力，并建立了MoCentric-Bench测评标准。还建立了强大的单帧基线模型，并探索了简单的运动适配技术。

Result: 建立的单帧基线模型表现与现有方法相当或更优，运动适配技术在MoCentric-Bench上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 这个以运动为中心的测评标准、评估方法和发现将促使未来模型改善密集时空基准和像素级视觉理解能力。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
generalization across tasks using images and text modalities. While their
extension to video has enabled tasks such as video question answering and video
captioning, their pixel-level visual grounding abilities are less studied. In
this work, we raise the pertinent question of whether motion is used in
pixel-level visual grounding and whether video MLLMs can segment objects based
on natural language expressions describing their motion patterns. We identify
the shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame
can often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any
temporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing
techniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video
MLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to
grasp the motion order. Consequently, we provide a motion-centric benchmark,
MoCentric-Bench. It ensures that video MLLMs are evaluated towards leveraging
the interaction between motion and language rather than being dominated by
static appearance cues emphasized in existing visual grounding datasets. We
further establish strong single-image baselines that are on par with or
outperform prior methods. Finally, we explore simple motion-centric adaptation
techniques that provide state-of-the-art performance on our MoCentric-Bench.
Our motion-centric benchmark, evaluation and findings challenge future models
to improve dense spatiotemporal grounding and pixel-level understanding within
videos. Code and datasets will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/MSiam/PixFoundation-2.0.git.

Abstract: Colon cancer also known as Colorectal cancer, is one of the most malignant
types of cancer worldwide. Early-stage detection of colon cancer is highly
crucial to prevent its deterioration. This research presents a hybrid
multi-scale deep learning architecture that synergizes capsule networks, graph
attention mechanisms, transformer modules, and residual learning to advance
colon cancer classification on the Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological
Image Dataset (LC25000) dataset. The proposed model in this paper utilizes the
HG-TNet model that introduces a hybrid architecture that joins strength points
in transformers and convolutional neural networks to capture multi-scale
features in histopathological images. Mainly, a transformer branch extracts
global contextual bonds by partitioning the image into patches by
convolution-based patch embedding and then processing these patches through a
transformer encoder. Analogously, a dedicated CNN branch captures fine-grained,
local details through successive Incorporation these diverse features, combined
with a self-supervised rotation prediction objective, produce a robust
diagnostic representation that surpasses standard architectures in performance.
Results show better performance not only in accuracy or loss function but also
in these algorithms by utilizing capsule networks to preserve spatial orders
and realize how each element individually combines and forms whole structures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于强化学习的主动视频采集框架，用于主动脉狭窄诊断，仅用47%的超声视频即可达到80.6%的分类准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决农村和资源匮乏地区超声心动图检查资源有限的问题，以及传统方法需要固定视频序列的局限性

Method: 使用强化学习驱动的主动视频采集框架，动态选择每个患者最具信息量的超声视频，持续评估是否需要额外成像

Result: 在2,572名患者数据上测试，达到80.6%分类准确率，仅使用47%的超声视频（相比完整采集）

Conclusion: 主动特征采集方法能够提高主动脉狭窄诊断效率，使超声心动图评估更加高效、可扩展和个性化

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a life-threatening condition caused by a narrowing of
the aortic valve, leading to impaired blood flow. Despite its high prevalence,
access to echocardiography (echo), the gold-standard diagnostic tool, is often
limited due to resource constraints, particularly in rural and underserved
areas. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) offers a more accessible alternative
but is restricted by operator expertise and the challenge of selecting the most
relevant imaging views. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning
(RL)-driven active video acquisition framework that dynamically selects each
patient's most informative echo videos. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
a fixed set of videos, our approach continuously evaluates whether additional
imaging is needed, optimizing both accuracy and efficiency. Tested on data from
2,572 patients, our method achieves 80.6% classification accuracy while using
only 47% of the echo videos compared to a full acquisition. These results
demonstrate the potential of active feature acquisition to enhance AS
diagnosis, making echocardiographic assessments more efficient, scalable, and
personalized. Our source code is available at:

Abstract: There is a growing interest in the development of lidar-based autonomous
mobility and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). To operate and research
on lidar data, researchers often develop code specific to application niche.
This approach leads to duplication of efforts across studies that, in many
cases, share multiple methodological steps such as data input/output (I/O),
pre/post processing, and common algorithms in multi-stage solutions. Moreover,
slight changes in data, algorithms, and/or research focus may force major
revisions in the code. To address these challenges, we present LiGuard, an
open-source software framework that allows researchers to: 1) rapidly develop
code for their lidar-based projects by providing built-in support for data I/O,
pre/post processing, and commonly used algorithms, 2) interactively
add/remove/reorder custom algorithms and adjust their parameters, and 3)
visualize results for classification, detection, segmentation, and tracking
tasks. Moreover, because it creates all the code files in structured
directories, it allows easy sharing of entire projects or even the individual
components to be reused by other researchers. The effectiveness of LiGuard is
demonstrated via case studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能交通系统中的LiDAR感知任务依赖大规模标注数据集，但创建这些数据集成本高、耗时、需要人工动，限制了系统的可扩展性。Sim2Real学习是一种可扩展的替代方案，但其效果取决于源模拟器的保真度。

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), for tasks
such as object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation, is
predominantly solved by deep neural network models which often require
large-scale labeled datasets during training to achieve generalization.
However, creating these datasets is costly. time consuming and require human
labor before the datasets are ready for training models. This hinders
scalability of the LiDAR-based perception systems in ITS. Sim2Real learning
offers scalable alternative, however, its effectiveness is dependent on the
fidelity of the source simulation(s) to real-world, in terms of environment
structure, actor dynamics, and sensor emulations. In response, this paper
introduces a rigorous and reproducible methodology for creating large-scale,
high-quality synthetic datasets using High-Fidelity Digital Twins (HiFi DTs).
The proposed workflow outlines the steps, tools, and best practices for
digitally replicating real-world environments, encompassing static geometry
modeling, road infrastructure replication, and dynamic traffic scenario
generation. Leveraging open-source and readily available resources such as
satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap data, alongside specific sensor
configurations, this paper provides practical, detailed guidance for
constructing robust synthetic environments. These environments subsequently
facilitate scalable, cost-effective, and diverse dataset generation, forming a
reliable foundation for robust Sim2Real learning.

Conclusion: 高保真数字孪生能有效减少域偏移，提升模型泛化能力，证明数字孪生在实现可靠的基于仿真的LiDAR感知方面具有重要作用。

Abstract: Sim2Real domain transfer offers a cost-effective and scalable approach for
developing LiDAR-based perception (e.g., object detection, tracking,
segmentation) in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, perception
models trained in simulation often under perform on real-world data due to
distributional shifts. To address this Sim2Real gap, this paper proposes a
high-fidelity digital twin (HiFi DT) framework that incorporates real-world
background geometry, lane-level road topology, and sensor-specific
specifications and placement. We formalize the domain adaptation challenge
underlying Sim2Real learning and present a systematic method for constructing
simulation environments that yield in-domain synthetic data. An off-the-shelf
3D object detector is trained on HiFi DT-generated synthetic data and evaluated
on real data. Our experiments show that the DT-trained model outperforms the
equivalent model trained on real data by 4.8%. To understand this gain, we
quantify distributional alignment between synthetic and real data using
multiple metrics, including Chamfer Distance (CD), Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD), Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), and Fr'echet Distance (FD), at both
raw-input and latent-feature levels. Results demonstrate that HiFi DTs
substantially reduce domain shift and improve generalization across diverse
evaluation scenarios. These findings underscore the significant role of digital
twins in enabling reliable, simulation-based LiDAR perception for real-world
ITS applications.

*Midhat Urooj,Ayan Banerjee,Farhat Shaikh,Kuntal Thakur,Sandeep Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KG-DG是一个神经符号框架，通过整合视觉变换器和专家引导的符号推理，在糖尿病视网膜病变分类中实现跨域泛化，在多个数据集上取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像中领域泛化的关键挑战，传统单源训练模型在真实世界分布偏移下表现不佳，需要构建临床鲁棒且领域不变的医疗AI系统。

Method: 提出神经符号框架KG-DG，整合视觉变换器与专家引导的符号推理，利用临床病变本体构建结构化规则特征和视网膜血管分割，通过置信度加权集成策略与深度视觉表示融合，最小化域嵌入间的KL散度来对齐高层临床语义。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上实验显示：跨域设置准确率提升5.2%，比基线ViT模型提升6%；符号模型在MDG中达到63.67%平均准确率；神经符号集成在SDG场景中达到最高准确率；基于病变的特征准确率达84.65%，显著优于纯神经方法。

Conclusion: 神经符号集成是构建临床鲁棒、领域不变医疗AI系统的有前景范式，符号组件不仅是可解释性增强工具，更是有效的正则化器。

Abstract: Domain generalization remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
models trained on single sources often fail under real-world distribution
shifts. We propose KG-DG, a neuro-symbolic framework for diabetic retinopathy
(DR) classification that integrates vision transformers with expert-guided
symbolic reasoning to enable robust generalization across unseen domains. Our
approach leverages clinical lesion ontologies through structured, rule-based
features and retinal vessel segmentation, fusing them with deep visual
representations via a confidence-weighted integration strategy. The framework
addresses both single-domain generalization (SDG) and multi-domain
generalization (MDG) by minimizing the KL divergence between domain embeddings,
thereby enforcing alignment of high-level clinical semantics. Extensive
experiments across four public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1,
Messidor-2) demonstrate significant improvements: up to a 5.2% accuracy gain in
cross-domain settings and a 6% improvement over baseline ViT models. Notably,
our symbolic-only model achieves a 63.67% average accuracy in MDG, while the
complete neuro-symbolic integration achieves the highest accuracy compared to
existing published baselines and benchmarks in challenging SDG scenarios.
Ablation studies reveal that lesion-based features (84.65% accuracy)
substantially outperform purely neural approaches, confirming that symbolic
components act as effective regularizers beyond merely enhancing
interpretability. Our findings establish neuro-symbolic integration as a
promising paradigm for building clinically robust, and domain-invariant medical
AI systems.

*Zeyu Liu,Shengwei Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STAR是一个快速、轻量级的开源框架，用于全切片组织病理图像的刚性配准，特别适用于连续切片的多染色对齐，具有高效、鲁棒和可复现的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的序列全切片组织病理图像配准方法通常依赖计算密集且难以复现的复杂可变形或深度学习方案，而适用于连续切片场景的轻量级刚性配准框架开发不足。

Method: STAR集成了染色条件预处理、分层粗到精相关策略、自适应核缩放和内置质量控制，实现跨异质组织类型和染色协议的可靠刚性配准。

Result: 在ANHIR 2019和ACROBAT 2022数据集上的评估显示，STAR能在几分钟内为每张切片生成稳定的对齐结果，对跨染色变异性和部分组织重叠具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: STAR作为一个开放轻量级工具，提供了可复现的基线，降低了临床应用的障碍，并为下一代计算病理学的大规模配对数据准备提供了支持。

Abstract: Registration of serial whole-slide histopathological images (WSIs) is
critical for enabling direct comparison across diverse stains and for preparing
paired datasets in artificial intelligence (AI) workflows such as virtual
staining and biomarker prediction. While existing methods often rely on complex
deformable or deep learning approaches that are computationally intensive and
difficult to reproduce, lightweight rigid frameworks-sufficient for many
consecutive-section scenarios-remain underdeveloped. We introduce STAR (Serial
Tissue Alignment for Rigid registration), a fast and robust open-source
framework for multi-WSI alignment. STAR integrates stain-conditioned
preprocessing with a hierarchical coarse-to-fine correlation strategy, adaptive
kernel scaling, and built-in quality control, achieving reliable rigid
registration across heterogeneous tissue types and staining protocols,
including hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), special histochemical stains (e.g., PAS,
PASM, Masson's), and immunohistochemical (IHC) markers (e.g., CD31, KI67).
Evaluated on the ANHIR 2019 and ACROBAT 2022 datasets spanning multiple organs
and scanning conditions, STAR consistently produced stable alignments within
minutes per slide, demonstrating robustness to cross-stain variability and
partial tissue overlap. Beyond benchmarks, we present case studies on H&E-IHC
alignment, construction of multi-IHC panels, and typical failure modes,
underscoring both utility and limitations. Released as an open and lightweight
tool, STAR provides a reproducible baseline that lowers the barrier for
clinical adoption and enables large-scale paired data preparation for
next-generation computational pathology.

Abstract: Multimodal industrial surface defect detection (MISDD) aims to identify and
locate defect in industrial products by fusing RGB and 3D modalities. This
article focuses on modality-missing problems caused by uncertain sensors
availability in MISDD. In this context, the fusion of multiple modalities
encounters several troubles, including learning mode transformation and
information vacancy. To this end, we first propose cross-modal prompt learning,
which includes: i) the cross-modal consistency prompt serves the establishment
of information consistency of dual visual modalities; ii) the modality-specific
prompt is inserted to adapt different input patterns; iii) the missing-aware
prompt is attached to compensate for the information vacancy caused by dynamic
modalities-missing. In addition, we propose symmetric contrastive learning,
which utilizes text modality as a bridge for fusion of dual vision modalities.
Specifically, a paired antithetical text prompt is designed to generate binary
text semantics, and triple-modal contrastive pre-training is offered to
accomplish multimodal learning. Experiment results show that our proposed
method achieves 73.83% I-AUROC and 93.05% P-AUROC with a total missing rate 0.7
for RGB and 3D modalities (exceeding state-of-the-art methods 3.84% and 5.58%
respectively), and outperforms existing approaches to varying degrees under
different missing types and rates. The source code will be available at

### [12] [EdgeAttNet: Towards Barb-Aware Filament Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02964)
*Victor Solomon,Piet Martens,Jingyu Liu,Rafal Angryk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EdgeAttNet是一种基于U-Net的太阳细丝分割架构，通过引入可学习的边缘图来增强自注意力机制，显著提高了细丝边界和分支的识别精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在H-alpha观测中难以准确捕捉太阳细丝的精细结构（特别是分支），主要原因是缺乏对长距离依赖关系和空间细节的建模能力。

Method: 在U-Net骨干网络上引入直接从输入图像派生的可学习边缘图，通过将边缘信息线性变换到注意力Key和Query矩阵中，引导瓶颈层的自注意力机制更好地捕捉细丝边界。

Result: 在MAGFILO数据集上，EdgeAttNet优于U-Net和其他基于U-Net的transformer基线，实现了更高的分割精度和显著更好的细丝分支识别，同时推理速度更快。

Conclusion: 通过将结构先验显式集成到注意力计算中，EdgeAttNet在减少可训练参数的同时增强了空间敏感性和分割精度，适合实际部署应用。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of solar filaments in H-alpha observations is critical
for determining filament chirality, a key factor in the behavior of Coronal
Mass Ejections (CMEs). However, existing methods often fail to capture
fine-scale filament structures, particularly barbs, due to a limited ability to
model long-range dependencies and spatial detail.
  We propose EdgeAttNet, a segmentation architecture built on a U-Net backbone
by introducing a novel, learnable edge map derived directly from the input
image. This edge map is incorporated into the model by linearly transforming
the attention Key and Query matrices with the edge information, thereby guiding
the self-attention mechanism at the network's bottleneck to more effectively
capture filament boundaries and barbs. By explicitly integrating this
structural prior into the attention computations, EdgeAttNet enhances spatial
sensitivity and segmentation accuracy while reducing the number of trainable
parameters.
  Trained end-to-end, EdgeAttNet outperforms U-Net and other U-Net-based
transformer baselines on the MAGFILO dataset. It achieves higher segmentation
accuracy and significantly better recognition of filament barbs, with faster
inference performance suitable for practical deployment.

TL;DR: KEPT是一个知识增强的视觉语言模型框架，通过检索场景对齐的范例和链式思维提示，在nuScenes数据集上实现了最先进的短时轨迹预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在自动驾驶轨迹预测中难以有效基于场景动态和领域知识进行推理，需要提升预测准确性和安全性。

Method: 结合时间频率-空间融合视频编码器、k-means+HNSW检索堆栈提供场景对齐范例，通过三阶段微调将检索先验嵌入链式思维提示。

Abstract: Accurate short-horizon trajectory prediction is pivotal for safe and reliable
autonomous driving, yet existing vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to
effectively ground their reasoning in scene dynamics and domain knowledge. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces KEPT, a knowledge-enhanced VLM
framework that predicts ego trajectories directly from consecutive front-view
driving frames. KEPT couples a temporal frequency-spatial fusion (TFSF) video
encoder, trained via self-supervised learning with hard-negative mining, with a
scalable k-means + HNSW retrieval stack that supplies scene-aligned exemplars.
Retrieved priors are embedded into chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts with explicit
planning constraints, while a triple-stage fine-tuning schedule incrementally
aligns the language head to metric spatial cues, physically feasible motion,
and temporally conditioned front-view planning. Evaluated on nuScenes dataset,
KEPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across open-loop protocols: under
NoAvg, it achieves 0.70m average L2 with a 0.21\% collision rate; under TemAvg
with lightweight ego status, it attains 0.31m average L2 and a 0.07\% collision
rate. Ablation studies show that all three fine-tuning stages contribute
complementary benefits, and that using Top-2 retrieved exemplars yields the
best accuracy-safety trade-off. The k-means-clustered HNSW index delivers
sub-millisecond retrieval latency, supporting practical deployment. These
results indicate that retrieval-augmented, CoT-guided VLMs offer a promising,
data-efficient pathway toward interpretable and trustworthy autonomous driving.

*Xianbao Hou,Yonghao He,Zeyd Boukhers,John See,Hu Su,Wei Sui,Cong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstaDA是一个无需训练的双智能体系统，通过文本智能体和图像智能体协同工作，提升实例分割数据集的质量和多样性，在LVIS 1.0验证集上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实例分割数据标注成本高、类别不平衡的问题，现有方法缺乏大语言模型与扩散模型的深度协作，且未充分利用现有训练数据的丰富信息。

Method: 提出双智能体系统：1) 文本智能体(T-Agent)通过Prompt Rethink机制迭代优化提示词，促进LLM与扩散模型协作；2) 图像智能体(I-Agent)基于训练图像生成新实例来丰富数据分布。两个智能体都是独立自动化的流程。

Result: 在LVIS 1.0验证集上，相比基线方法提升box AP +4.0和mask AP +3.3，优于领先模型DiverGen，在常见类别上获得+0.7 box AP增益，在常见和频繁类别上分别获得+0.2和+0.5 mask AP增益。

Conclusion: InstaDA通过双智能体架构有效提升了实例分割数据集的多样性和质量，证明了LLM与扩散模型深度协作的价值，为数据增强提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality instance segmentation data is challenging due to the
labor-intensive nature of the annotation process and significant class
imbalances within datasets. Recent studies have utilized the integration of
Copy-Paste and diffusion models to create more diverse datasets. However, these
studies often lack deep collaboration between large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, and underutilize the rich information within the existing
training data. To address these limitations, we propose InstaDA, a novel,
training-free Dual-Agent system designed to augment instance segmentation
datasets. First, we introduce a Text-Agent (T-Agent) that enhances data
diversity through collaboration between LLMs and diffusion models. This agent
features a novel Prompt Rethink mechanism, which iteratively refines prompts
based on the generated images. This process not only fosters collaboration but
also increases image utilization and optimizes the prompts themselves.
Additionally, we present an Image-Agent (I-Agent) aimed at enriching the
overall data distribution. This agent augments the training set by generating
new instances conditioned on the training images. To ensure practicality and
efficiency, both agents operate as independent and automated workflows,
enhancing usability. Experiments conducted on the LVIS 1.0 validation set
indicate that InstaDA achieves significant improvements, with an increase of
+4.0 in box average precision (AP) and +3.3 in mask AP compared to the
baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the leading model, DiverGen, by +0.3 in
box AP and +0.1 in mask AP, with a notable +0.7 gain in box AP on common
categories and mask AP gains of +0.2 on common categories and +0.5 on frequent
categories.

TL;DR: SPENet是一个用于少样本医学图像分割的自引导原型增强网络，通过多级原型生成和查询引导的局部原型增强来解决传统方法忽略类内变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于原型的少样本医学图像分割方法通常为支持图像生成单一全局原型来匹配查询图像，忽略了类内变化，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出SPENet网络，包含多级原型生成模块（同时生成全局原型和自适应数量的局部原型）和查询引导的局部原型增强模块（利用查询图像指导来精炼支持原型）。

Result: 在三个公共医学数据集上的大量实验表明，SPENet优于现有的最先进方法，实现了卓越的性能。

Conclusion: SPENet通过多粒度原型匹配和查询引导的原型增强，有效解决了少样本医学图像分割中的类内变化问题，取得了state-of-the-art的性能。

Abstract: Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation (FSMIS) aims to segment novel classes of
medical objects using only a few labeled images. Prototype-based methods have
made significant progress in addressing FSMIS. However, they typically generate
a single global prototype for the support image to match with the query image,
overlooking intra-class variations. To address this issue, we propose a
Self-guided Prototype Enhancement Network (SPENet). Specifically, we introduce
a Multi-level Prototype Generation (MPG) module, which enables
multi-granularity measurement between the support and query images by
simultaneously generating a global prototype and an adaptive number of local
prototypes. Additionally, we observe that not all local prototypes in the
support image are beneficial for matching, especially when there are
substantial discrepancies between the support and query images. To alleviate
this issue, we propose a Query-guided Local Prototype Enhancement (QLPE)
module, which adaptively refines support prototypes by incorporating guidance
from the query image, thus mitigating the negative effects of such
discrepancies. Extensive experiments on three public medical datasets
demonstrate that SPENet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior performance.

Motivation: 遥感图像中的小目标实例分割研究不足，缺乏专用数据集，且现有SAM模型由于1/16的粗糙特征分辨率导致小目标分割性能显著下降

Method: SOPSeg框架包含区域自适应放大策略以保留细粒度细节，定制解码器集成边缘预测和渐进细化，以及针对遥感应用中广泛采用的定向边界框的新提示机制

Result: SOPSeg在小目标分割方面优于现有方法，并促进了遥感任务的高效数据集构建

Conclusion: 该研究填补了小目标实例分割的空白，提出的SOPSeg框架和构建的数据集将为未来研究提供支持

Abstract: Extracting small objects from remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in
various applications, including urban planning, environmental monitoring, and
disaster management. While current research primarily focuses on small object
detection, instance segmentation for small objects remains underexplored, with
no dedicated datasets available. This gap stems from the technical challenges
and high costs of pixel-level annotation for small objects. While the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates impressive zero-shot generalization, its
performance on small-object segmentation deteriorates significantly, largely
due to the coarse 1/16 feature resolution that causes severe loss of fine
spatial details. To this end, we propose SOPSeg, a prompt-based framework
specifically designed for small object segmentation in remote sensing imagery.
It incorporates a region-adaptive magnification strategy to preserve
fine-grained details, and employs a customized decoder that integrates edge
prediction and progressive refinement for accurate boundary delineation.
Moreover, we introduce a novel prompting mechanism tailored to the oriented
bounding boxes widely adopted in remote sensing applications. SOPSeg
outperforms existing methods in small object segmentation and facilitates
efficient dataset construction for remote sensing tasks. We further construct a
comprehensive small object instance segmentation dataset based on SODA-A, and
will release both the model and dataset to support future research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后处理水印相比处理中水印更具灵活性，可应用于任何生成模型的输出，且能为单个图像嵌入独特水印，但需要增强其鲁棒性

Method: 构建CNN和Transformer在空间域和频域的多种攻击网络组合，研究不同组合对水印模型鲁棒性的影响，采用集成攻击网络进行训练

Result: 空间域CNN攻击网络与频域Transformer攻击网络的组合获得最高鲁棒性，在WAVES基准测试中平均比特准确率显著提升，特别是对再生攻击使StegaStamp提升18.743%

Conclusion: 集成攻击网络训练能有效增强后处理水印的鲁棒性，空间域CNN与频域Transformer的组合是最优攻击网络配置

Abstract: Recent studies on deep watermarking have predominantly focused on
in-processing watermarking, which integrates the watermarking process into
image generation. However, post-processing watermarking, which embeds
watermarks after image generation, offers more flexibility. It can be applied
to outputs from any generative model (e.g. GANs, diffusion models) without
needing access to the model's internal structure. It also allows users to embed
unique watermarks into individual images. Therefore, this study focuses on
post-processing watermarking and enhances its robustness by incorporating an
ensemble attack network during training. We construct various versions of
attack networks using CNN and Transformer in both spatial and frequency domains
to investigate how each combination influences the robustness of the
watermarking model. Our results demonstrate that combining a CNN-based attack
network in the spatial domain with a Transformer-based attack network in the
frequency domain yields the highest robustness in watermarking models.
Extensive evaluation on the WAVES benchmark, using average bit accuracy as the
metric, demonstrates that our ensemble attack network significantly enhances
the robustness of baseline watermarking methods under various stress tests. In
particular, for the Regeneration Attack defined in WAVES, our method improves
StegaStamp by 18.743%. The code is released

TL;DR: 研究发现大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)经常错误地将文本输入中缺乏视觉证据的概念误认为是图像内容，导致错误响应。论文识别出特定的前馈网络神经元(VA神经元)能够检测视觉缺失，并基于此开发了检测模块来识别文本概念是否在图像中存在，从而改进模型输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在处理视觉和文本输入时，经常错误地将文本描述中缺乏视觉证据的概念误认为是图像中的实际内容，这导致了不准确的响应。研究者希望探究模型是否具备内部能力来判断文本概念是否在图像中真实存在。

Method: 1. 识别前馈网络中的视觉缺失感知(VA)神经元，这些神经元通过特定的激活模式指示视觉缺失；2. 开发检测模块系统分类输入标记是否具有视觉基础；3. 基于预测结果重新解释问题提示或在生成过程中替换检测到的缺失标记来优化输出。

Result: 实验表明该方法有效缓解了模型错误假定文本输入具有视觉存在的倾向，并且在各种大型视觉语言模型中具有通用性。

Conclusion: 通过识别和利用VA神经元的激活模式，可以开发有效的检测和修正机制来改善大型视觉语言模型对视觉-文本输入的处理准确性，减少因错误感知视觉存在而产生的响应错误。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) generate contextually relevant responses
by jointly interpreting visual and textual inputs. However, our finding reveals
they often mistakenly perceive text inputs lacking visual evidence as being
part of the image, leading to erroneous responses. In light of this finding, we
probe whether LVLMs possess an internal capability to determine if textual
concepts are grounded in the image, and discover a specific subset of
Feed-Forward Network (FFN) neurons, termed Visual Absence-aware (VA) neurons,
that consistently signal the visual absence through a distinctive activation
pattern. Leveraging these patterns, we develop a detection module that
systematically classifies whether an input token is visually grounded. Guided
by its prediction, we propose a method to refine the outputs by reinterpreting
question prompts or replacing the detected absent tokens during generation.
Extensive experiments show that our method effectively mitigates the models'
tendency to falsely presume the visual presence of text input and its
generality across various LVLMs.

Result: 在两个整体和两个遮挡ReID基准测试上取得优异结果，达到或超越当前最先进方法

Conclusion: 背景语义与前景语义在ReID中同等重要，联合建模两者并通过对抗学习增强判别能力能有效提升模型性能

Abstract: Person re-identification faces two core challenges: precisely locating the
foreground target while suppressing background noise and extracting
fine-grained features from the target region. Numerous visual-only approaches
address these issues by partitioning an image and applying attention modules,
yet they rely on costly manual annotations and struggle with complex
occlusions. Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic
cues to guide visual understanding. However, they focus solely on foreground
information, but overlook the potential value of background cues. Inspired by
human perception, we argue that background semantics are as important as the
foreground semantics in ReID, as humans tend to eliminate background
distractions while focusing on target appearance. Therefore, this paper
proposes an end-to-end framework that jointly models foreground and background
information within a dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction pipeline. To
help the network distinguish between the two domains, we propose an
intra-semantic alignment and inter-semantic adversarial learning strategy.
Specifically, we align visual and textual features that share the same
semantics across domains, while simultaneously penalizing similarity between
foreground and background features to enhance the network's discriminative
power. This strategy drives the model to actively suppress noisy background
regions and enhance attention toward identity-relevant foreground cues.
Comprehensive experiments on two holistic and two occluded ReID benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method, with
results that match or surpass those of current state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 皮肤病变分割是皮肤癌计算机辅助诊断的关键技术挑战。传统CNN受限于有限感受野难以建模长距离依赖，而Vision Transformers虽然能捕获全局上下文，但二次复杂度和大量参数限制了在医学小样本数据集上的应用。

Method: 提出MedLiteNet混合架构：编码器使用深度可分离Mobile Inverted Bottleneck块减少计算量；插入瓶颈级跨尺度token混合单元在不同分辨率间交换信息；嵌入边界感知自注意力模块来锐化病变轮廓。

Result: 该方法实现了高精度的皮肤病变分割，同时保持了轻量级计算特性，适合在医学小样本数据集上使用。

Conclusion: MedLiteNet成功解决了皮肤病变分割中全局上下文建模与计算效率之间的平衡问题，为医学图像分割提供了一种有效的轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate skin-lesion segmentation remains a key technical challenge for
computer-aided diagnosis of skin cancer. Convolutional neural networks, while
effective, are constrained by limited receptive fields and thus struggle to
model long-range dependencies. Vision Transformers capture global context, yet
their quadratic complexity and large parameter budgets hinder use on the
small-sample medical datasets common in dermatology. We introduce the
MedLiteNet, a lightweight CNN Transformer hybrid tailored for dermoscopic
segmentation that achieves high precision through hierarchical feature
extraction and multi-scale context aggregation. The encoder stacks depth-wise
Mobile Inverted Bottleneck blocks to curb computation, inserts a
bottleneck-level cross-scale token-mixing unit to exchange information between
resolutions, and embeds a boundary-aware self-attention module to sharpen
lesion contours.

Motivation: 条件扩散模型在图像处理领域进展显著，但在多任务场景中难以利用任务间的内在相关性，特别是在训练数据不足的病态任务中表现更差。传统静态条件控制难以适应多任务场景的动态演化特性。

Method: 提出动态条件双扩散桥训练范式：1) 解耦扩散和条件生成过程，避免扩散模型对监督数据的依赖；2) 使用相同噪声调度生成动态条件，逐步调整统计特征，自然嵌入时间相关信息，降低网络学习难度。

Result: 在去雾和可见光-红外融合等典型病态多任务场景中，在多个公开数据集上取得了最佳性能指标。

Conclusion: 该范式通过动态条件机制有效解决了病态多任务场景中的挑战，分析表明动态条件在单步去噪过程中具有优越性，注意力权重变化验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have made impressive progress in the field of
image processing, but the characteristics of constructing data distribution
pathways make it difficult to exploit the intrinsic correlation between tasks
in multi-task scenarios, which is even worse in ill-posed tasks with a lack of
training data. In addition, traditional static condition control makes it
difficult for networks to learn in multi-task scenarios with its dynamically
evolving characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic
conditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm to build a general
framework for ill-posed multi-tasks. Firstly, this paradigm decouples the
diffusion and condition generation processes, avoiding the dependence of the
diffusion model on supervised data in ill-posed tasks. Secondly, generated by
the same noise schedule, dynamic conditions are used to gradually adjust their
statistical characteristics, naturally embed time-related information, and
reduce the difficulty of network learning. We analyze the learning objectives
of the network under different conditional forms in the single-step denoising
process and compare the changes in its attention weights in the network,
demonstrating the superiority of our dynamic conditions. Taking dehazing and
visible-infrared fusion as typical ill-posed multi-task scenarios, we achieve
the best performance in multiple indicators on public datasets. The code has
been publicly released at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DCDB-D3C2.

Abstract: Handwritten characters can be trickier to classify due to their complex and
cursive nature compared to simple and non-cursive characters. We present an
external classifier along with a Generative Adversarial Network that can
classify highly cursive and complex characters. The generator network produces
fake handwritten character images, which are then used to augment the training
data after adding adversarially perturbed noise and achieving a confidence
score above a threshold with the discriminator network. The results show that
the accuracy of convolutional neural networks decreases as character complexity
increases, but our proposed model, ADA-GAN, remains more robust and effective
for both cursive and complex characters.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms pose a significant clinical risk yet are difficult to
detect, delineate and model due to limited annotated 3D data. We propose a
cross-domain feature-transfer approach that leverages the latent geometric
embeddings learned by TRELLIS, a generative model trained on large-scale
non-medical 3D datasets, to augment neural networks for aneurysm analysis. By
replacing conventional point normals or mesh descriptors with TRELLIS surface
features, we systematically enhance three downstream tasks: (i) classifying
aneurysms versus healthy vessels in the Intra3D dataset, (ii) segmenting
aneurysm and vessel regions on 3D meshes, and (iii) predicting time-evolving
blood-flow fields using a graph neural network on the AnXplore dataset. Our
experiments show that the inclusion of these features yields strong gains in
accuracy, F1-score and segmentation quality over state-of-the-art baselines,
and reduces simulation error by 15\%. These results illustrate the broader
potential of transferring 3D representations from general-purpose generative
models to specialized medical tasks.

Abstract: Face recognition systems are robust against environmental changes and noise,
and thus may be vulnerable to illegal authentication attempts using user face
photos, such as spoofing attacks. To prevent such spoofing attacks, it is
crucial to discriminate whether the input image is a live user image or a
spoofed image prior to the face recognition process. Most existing spoofing
attack detection methods utilize deep learning, which necessitates a
substantial amount of training data. Consequently, if malicious data is
injected into a portion of the training dataset, a specific spoofing attack may
be erroneously classified as live, leading to false positives.In this paper, we
propose a novel backdoor poisoning attack method to demonstrate the latent
threat of backdoor poisoning within face anti-spoofing detection. The proposed
method enables certain spoofing attacks to bypass detection by embedding
features extracted from the spoofing attack's face image into a live face image
without inducing any perceptible visual alterations.Through experiments
conducted on public datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method
constitutes a realistic threat to existing spoofing attack detection systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAIM-Net是一个时间序列变化检测网络，通过从变化时刻推断变化区域来确保两者结果的一致性，包含差异提取增强、粗粒度变化时刻提取、细粒度变化时刻提取和变化区域推断三个关键步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法将变化区域检测和变化时刻识别作为独立任务处理，但实际上变化区域可以从变化时刻推断得到，因此需要确保两者结果的一致性。

Method: 采用三阶段方法：1）差异提取和增强（轻量编码器+边界增强卷积）；2）粗粒度变化时刻提取（时空相关性分析）；3）细粒度变化时刻提取和变化区域推断（多尺度时间CAM模块）。

Result: 通过从变化时刻推断变化区域，确保了变化检测结果中区域和时刻的一致性。

Conclusion: CAIM-Net通过利用时间序列分析与空间变化检测的内在关系，实现了从变化时刻到变化区域的统一推断框架，提高了变化检测的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: Time series change detection is a critical task for exploring ecosystem
dynamics using time series remote sensing images, because it can simultaneously
indicate where and when change occur. While deep learning has shown excellent
performance in this domain, it continues to approach change area detection and
change moment identification as distinct tasks. Given that change area can be
inferred from change moment, we propose a time series change detection network,
named CAIM-Net (Change Area Inference from Moment Network), to ensure
consistency between change area and change moment results. CAIM-Net infers
change area from change moment based on the intrinsic relationship between time
series analysis and spatial change detection. The CAIM-Net comprises three key
steps: Difference Extraction and Enhancement, Coarse Change Moment Extraction,
and Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference. In the Difference
Extraction and Enhancement, a lightweight encoder with batch dimension stacking
is designed to rapidly extract difference features. Subsequently, boundary
enhancement convolution is applied to amplify these difference features. In the
Coarse Change Moment Extraction, the enhanced difference features from the
first step are used to spatiotemporal correlation analysis, and then two
distinct methods are employed to determine coarse change moments. In the Fine
Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference, a multiscale temporal Class
Activation Mapping (CAM) module first increases the weight of the
change-occurring moment from coarse change moments. Then the weighted change
moment is used to infer change area based on the fact that pixels with the
change moment must have undergone a change.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于梯度自反思的token影响估计方法，通过影响感知对比解码框架同时缓解多模态大语言模型中的文本-视觉偏差和共现偏差，无需额外资源即可有效减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在文本-视觉偏差和共现偏差导致的幻觉问题，现有方法缺乏对实例间偏差水平波动的理解，需要一种无需额外资源的方法来同时解决这两种偏差。

Method: 使用基于梯度的自反思方法估计不同类型token（视觉、提示、先前输出）的影响，检测与对象相关的视觉token，并将其整合到影响感知对比解码框架中。

Result: 在LLaVA-QA90上实现了高达92%的准确率提升，有效减少了幻觉现象。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不依赖额外资源的情况下，有效缓解多模态大语言模型中的两种主要偏差类型，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language model are caused by the
text-visual bias and the co-occurrence bias. The former reflects an
over-reliance on text information in the decision-making process, while the
latter arises from the statistical object-pairing patterns abstracted from the
training data. Existing mitigation methods heuristically address these biases
without understanding the fluctuating bias level across the instances. We first
propose estimating the influence of respective token types (visual, prompt, and
previous outputs) using a gradient-based self-reflection method. The estimated
token influence further enables the detection of object-related visual tokens
and their integration into an influence-aware contrastive decoding framework to
mitigate both types of biases simultaneously. Our method operates without the
need for additional resources, such as costly fine-tuning, extra models, or
data statistics. Extensive experiments show it effectively reduces
hallucinations, achieving up to a 92% accuracy increase on LLaVA-QA90.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手-物体姿态估计方法在复杂几何交互中常出现穿透、间隙问题，且难以捕捉手部真实变形，需要更物理合理和语义指导的交互建模方法。

Method: 将手-物体交互建模为引力场驱动过程，提出Gravity-Field Based Diffusion Bridge方法，模拟可变形手部表面与刚性物体的交互，并利用文本语义信息指导引力场构建。

Result: 在多个数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法能有效消除穿透、确保稳定抓握、捕捉真实手部变形，生成物理合理的交互效果。

Conclusion: GravityDB方法成功解决了手-物体交互中的关键挑战，通过引力场扩散桥实现了物理合理且语义指导的交互建模，为复杂手-物体交互提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing reconstruction or hand-object pose estimation methods are capable of
producing coarse interaction states. However, due to the complex and diverse
geometry of both human hands and objects, these approaches often suffer from
interpenetration or leave noticeable gaps in regions that are supposed to be in
contact. Moreover, the surface of a real human hand undergoes non-negligible
deformations during interaction, which are difficult to capture and represent
with previous methods. To tackle these challenges, we formulate hand-object
interaction as an attraction-driven process and propose a Gravity-Field Based
Diffusion Bridge (GravityDB) to simulate interactions between a deformable hand
surface and rigid objects. Our approach effectively resolves the aforementioned
issues by generating physically plausible interactions that are free of
interpenetration, ensure stable grasping, and capture realistic hand
deformations. Furthermore, we incorporate semantic information from textual
descriptions to guide the construction of the gravitational field, enabling
more semantically meaningful interaction regions. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method.

TL;DR: 提出了TADM-3D模型，这是一个3D时间感知扩散模型，用于准确预测MRI脑部扫描的未来变化，通过脑龄估计器和双向时间正则化来改善时间关系建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在三个主要局限：无法明确捕捉结构变化与时间间隔的关系、仅依赖扫描插值缺乏临床实用性、大多基于2D架构忽略3D解剖上下文。需要开发能够准确预测脑部病理进展的3D方法。

Method: 使用预训练的脑龄估计器(BAE)指导扩散模型生成反映预期年龄差异的MRI；提出反向时间正则化(BITR)，通过双向训练（从基线到随访和从随访到基线）提高时间准确性。

Result: 在OASIS-3数据集上训练和评估，并在NACC数据集的外部测试集上验证了泛化性能。

Conclusion: TADM-3D能够准确预测脑部MRI的进展，通过脑龄指导和双向正则化有效解决了现有方法的时间建模不足问题，具有更好的临床实用性。

Abstract: Generating realistic MRIs to accurately predict future changes in the
structure of brain is an invaluable tool for clinicians in assessing clinical
outcomes and analysing the disease progression at the patient level. However,
current existing methods present some limitations: (i) some approaches fail to
explicitly capture the relationship between structural changes and time
intervals, especially when trained on age-imbalanced datasets; (ii) others rely
only on scan interpolation, which lack clinical utility, as they generate
intermediate images between timepoints rather than future pathological
progression; and (iii) most approaches rely on 2D slice-based architectures,
thereby disregarding full 3D anatomical context, which is essential for
accurate longitudinal predictions. We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion
Model (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes. To
better model the relationship between time interval and brain changes, TADM-3D
uses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) that guides the diffusion model in
the generation of MRIs that accurately reflect the expected age difference
between baseline and generated follow-up scans. Additionally, to further
improve the temporal awareness of TADM-3D, we propose the Back-In-Time
Regularisation (BITR), by training TADM-3D to predict bidirectionally from the
baseline to follow-up (forward), as well as from the follow-up to baseline
(backward). Although predicting past scans has limited clinical applications,
this regularisation helps the model generate temporally more accurate scans. We
train and evaluate TADM-3D on the OASIS-3 dataset, and we validate the
generalisation performance on an external test set from the NACC dataset. The
code will be available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了两种新颖的损失函数（负中心线损失和简化拓扑损失）来保持生物医学分割中细长结构的连续性，特别适用于信号丢失情况下的轴突起始段分割任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生物医学分割任务中，保持细长结构的连续性和长度比体素级精度更重要，特别是在信号丢失导致不连续的情况下。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络，结合负中心线损失和简化拓扑损失两种新型损失函数，并采用下采样和间距校正等实验设计技术。

Result: 与标准CNN和现有拓扑感知损失相比，新方法显著减少了每个实例的分割不连续性，特别是在输入信号缺失区域，改善了实例长度计算的准确性。

Conclusion: 在损失函数设计中嵌入结构先验可以显著提高生物应用分割的可靠性，特别是在保持细长结构连续性方面。

Abstract: In many biomedical segmentation tasks, the preservation of elongated
structure continuity and length is more important than voxel-wise accuracy. We
propose two novel loss functions, Negative Centerline Loss and Simplified
Topology Loss, that, applied to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), help
preserve connectivity of output instances. Moreover, we discuss characteristics
of experiment design, such as downscaling and spacing correction, that help
obtain continuous segmentation masks. We evaluate our approach on a 3D
light-sheet fluorescence microscopy dataset of axon initial segments (AIS), a
task prone to discontinuity due to signal dropout. Compared to standard CNNs
and existing topology-aware losses, our methods reduce the number of
segmentation discontinuities per instance, particularly in regions with missing
input signal, resulting in improved instance length calculation in downstream
applications. Our findings demonstrate that structural priors embedded in the
loss design can significantly enhance the reliability of segmentation for
biological applications.

Motivation: 解决人群密度估计中细粒度位置标注收集困难、耗时且难以扩展的问题，旨在仅使用计数标注就能预测包含定量空间信息的密度图

Method: 使用历史地图库生成伪密度图（初始化为无监督显著性估计），通过超几何分布采样位置，结合EMA更新策略和自监督对比空间正则化来增强空间感知

Conclusion: Count2Density能够有效从计数标注中提取空间信息，为减少标注负担提供了可行解决方案，在人群密度估计任务中具有重要应用价值

Abstract: Crowd density estimation is a well-known computer vision task aimed at
estimating the density distribution of people in an image. The main challenge
in this domain is the reliance on fine-grained location-level annotations,
(i.e. points placed on top of each individual) to train deep networks.
Collecting such detailed annotations is both tedious, time-consuming, and poses
a significant barrier to scalability for real-world applications. To alleviate
this burden, we present Count2Density: a novel pipeline designed to predict
meaningful density maps containing quantitative spatial information using only
count-level annotations (i.e., total number of people) during training. To
achieve this, Count2Density generates pseudo-density maps leveraging past
predictions stored in a Historical Map Bank, thereby reducing confirmation
bias. This bank is initialised using an unsupervised saliency estimator to
provide an initial spatial prior and is iteratively updated with an EMA of
predicted density maps. These pseudo-density maps are obtained by sampling
locations from estimated crowd areas using a hypergeometric distribution, with
the number of samplings determined by the count-level annotations. To further
enhance the spatial awareness of the model, we add a self-supervised
contrastive spatial regulariser to encourage similar feature representations
within crowded regions while maximising dissimilarity with background regions.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
cross-domain adaptation methods and achieves better results than recent
state-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised settings across several
datasets. Additional analyses validate the effectiveness of each individual
component of our pipeline, confirming the ability of Count2Density to
effectively retrieve spatial information from count-level annotations and
enabling accurate subregion counting.

Conclusion: 军事领域需要大型代表性数据集来进一步评估投毒攻击风险和补丁检测机会；AutoDetect方法为投毒检测提供了简单高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Poisoning attacks pose an increasing threat to the security and robustness of
Artificial Intelligence systems in the military domain. The widespread use of
open-source datasets and pretrained models exacerbates this risk. Despite the
severity of this threat, there is limited research on the application and
detection of poisoning attacks on object detection systems. This is especially
problematic in the military domain, where attacks can have grave consequences.
In this work, we both investigate the effect of poisoning attacks on military
object detectors in practice, and the best approach to detect these attacks. To
support this research, we create a small, custom dataset featuring military
vehicles: MilCivVeh. We explore the vulnerability of military object detectors
for poisoning attacks by implementing a modified version of the BadDet attack:
a patch-based poisoning attack. We then assess its impact, finding that while a
positive attack success rate is achievable, it requires a substantial portion
of the data to be poisoned -- raising questions about its practical
applicability. To address the detection challenge, we test both specialized
poisoning detection methods and anomaly detection methods from the visual
industrial inspection domain. Since our research shows that both classes of
methods are lacking, we introduce our own patch detection method: AutoDetect, a
simple, fast, and lightweight autoencoder-based method. Our method shows
promising results in separating clean from poisoned samples using the
reconstruction error of image slices, outperforming existing methods, while
being less time- and memory-intensive. We urge that the availability of large,
representative datasets in the military domain is a prerequisite to further
evaluate risks of poisoning attacks and opportunities patch detection.

Motivation: 低剂量CT在减少辐射暴露的同时会导致噪声增加和图像质量下降，传统去噪方法难以保持图像质量

Method: 使用强化学习方法，基于PPO算法实时优化去噪策略，通过编码器-解码器架构和定制化gym环境进行训练

Result: 在低剂量CT数据集上PSNR达41.87、SSIM达0.9814、RMSE达0.00236；在COVID-19数据集上分类准确率提升至94%，比无RL去噪提高4%

Conclusion: 该方法为更安全、更准确的低剂量CT成像提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is critical for minimizing radiation
exposure, but it often leads to increased noise and reduced image quality.
Traditional denoising methods, such as iterative optimization or supervised
learning, often fail to preserve image quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce PPORLD-EDNetLDCT, a reinforcement learning-based (RL) approach with
Encoder-Decoder for LDCT. Our method utilizes a dynamic RL-based approach in
which an advanced posterior policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is used to
optimize denoising policies in real time, based on image quality feedback,
trained via a custom gym environment. The experimental results on the low dose
CT image and projection dataset demonstrate that the proposed PPORLD-EDNetLDCT
model outperforms traditional denoising techniques and other DL-based methods,
achieving a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 41.87, a structural similarity index
measure of 0.9814 and a root mean squared error of 0.00236. Moreover, in
NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Challenge dataset our method achived a PSNR of
41.52, SSIM of 0.9723 and RMSE of 0.0051. Furthermore, we validated the quality
of denoising using a classification task in the COVID-19 LDCT dataset, where
the images processed by our method improved the classification accuracy to
94\%, achieving 4\% higher accuracy compared to denoising without RL-based
denoising. This method offers a promising solution for safer and more accurate
LDCT imaging.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved
natural language understanding and generation, enhancing Human-Computer
Interaction (HCI). However, LLMs are limited to unimodal text processing and
lack the ability to interpret emotional cues from non-verbal signals, hindering
more immersive and empathetic interactions. This work explores integrating
multimodal sentiment perception into LLMs to create emotion-aware agents. We
propose \ours, an AI-based virtual companion that captures multimodal sentiment
cues, enabling emotionally aligned and animated HCI. \ours introduces a
Multimodal Sentiment Perception Network (MSPN) using a cross-modal fusion
transformer and supervised contrastive learning to provide emotional cues.
Additionally, we develop an emotion-aware prompt engineering strategy for
generating empathetic responses and integrate a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system and
animated avatar module for expressive interactions. \ours provides a framework
for emotion-aware agents with applications in companion robotics, social care,
mental health, and human-centered AI.

Conclusion: RTGMFF通过结合文本生成和多模态特征融合，有效解决了fMRI脑疾病诊断中的关键挑战，为临床诊断提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool for probing
brain function, yet reliable clinical diagnosis is hampered by low
signal-to-noise ratios, inter-subject variability, and the limited frequency
awareness of prevailing CNN- and Transformer-based models. Moreover, most fMRI
datasets lack textual annotations that could contextualize regional activation
and connectivity patterns. We introduce RTGMFF, a framework that unifies
automatic ROI-level text generation with multimodal feature fusion for
brain-disorder diagnosis. RTGMFF consists of three components: (i) ROI-driven
fMRI text generation deterministically condenses each subject's activation,
connectivity, age, and sex into reproducible text tokens; (ii) Hybrid
frequency-spatial encoder fuses a hierarchical wavelet-mamba branch with a
cross-scale Transformer encoder to capture frequency-domain structure alongside
long-range spatial dependencies; and (iii) Adaptive semantic alignment module
embeds the ROI token sequence and visual features in a shared space, using a
regularized cosine-similarity loss to narrow the modality gap. Extensive
experiments on the ADHD-200 and ABIDE benchmarks show that RTGMFF surpasses
current methods in diagnostic accuracy, achieving notable gains in sensitivity,
specificity, and area under the ROC curve. Code is available at

Abstract: Organoids replicate organ structure and function, playing a crucial role in
fields such as tumor treatment and drug screening. Their shape and size can

complementary information extracted from CNN and Transformer modules and
introduces the innovative feature fusion module, Learnable Gaussian Band Pass

Abstract: Synthetic tumors in medical images offer controllable characteristics that
facilitate the training of machine learning models, leading to an improved
segmentation performance. However, the existing methods of tumor synthesis
yield suboptimal performances when tumor occupies a large spatial volume, such
as breast tumor segmentation in MRI with a large field-of-view (FOV), while
commonly used tumor generation methods are based on small patches. In this
paper, we propose a 3D medical diffusion model, called SynBT, to generate
high-quality breast tumor (BT) in contrast-enhanced MRI images. The proposed
model consists of a patch-to-volume autoencoder, which is able to compress the
high-resolution MRIs into compact latent space, while preserving the resolution
of volumes with large FOV. Using the obtained latent space feature vector, a
mask-conditioned diffusion model is used to synthesize breast tumors within
selected regions of breast tissue, resulting in realistic tumor appearances. We
evaluated the proposed method for a tumor segmentation task, which demonstrated
the proposed high-quality tumor synthesis method can facilitate the common
segmentation models with performance improvement of 2-3% Dice Score on a large
public dataset, and therefore provides benefits for tumor segmentation in MRI
images.

TL;DR: 本文提出PointAD+框架，通过结合点云和像素级别信息，将CLIP的2D普适性转移到3D异常检测中，支持对未见对象的零样本学习检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将CLIP在2D领域的强大普适性能力扩展到3D异常检测，解决在高度多样化类别语义的未见对象上进行3D异常检测的挑战。

Method: 首先设计PointAD，利用点-像素对应关系通过渲染像素表征来表示3D异常（隐式表征）。然后提出PointAD+，通过G-aggregation涵盖几何信息实现空间意识表征（显式表征）。采用层次表征学习，将隐式和显式异常语义结合到层次文本提示中，并通过跨层次对比对齐促进渲染层和几何层的互动学习。

Result: 大量实验证明PointAD+在零样本3D异常检测中体现优势，能够在高度多样化类别语义的未见对象上实现对异常的全面理解，并支持插拔式整合RGB信息以进一步提升检测性能。

Conclusion: PointAD+通过统一框架综合利用点级和像素级信息，成功将CLIP的2D普适性转移到3D异常检测领域，为处理高度多样化的未见对象异常检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to transfer CLIP's robust 2D generalization
capabilities to identify 3D anomalies across unseen objects of highly diverse
class semantics. To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively
detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level
information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel
correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering
pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D
representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects
the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose
PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing
explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal
spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry
information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To
simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes
hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit
anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the
rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy
contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between
the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning.
Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the
generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB
information in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in
ZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class
semantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索验证奖励强化学习在参数量少于70亿的轻量级多模态语言模型中的有效性，以及长思维链数据对其推理能力的提升作用

Method: 使用长思维链数据进行监督微调(SFT)，随后进行强化学习(RL)阶段

Result: 长思维链数据的SFT显著提升MLLM推理能力，后续RL阶段能带来额外性能增益

Conclusion: 长思维链数据的SFT阶段是开发轻量级MLLM推理能力的关键前提条件

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has enhanced the
reasoning of large-scale language models (LLMs), its efficacy for lightweight
multimodal language models (MLLMs) with fewer than seven billion parameters
remains underexplored. This paper investigates the role of long
Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of such
MLLMs. Our findings demonstrate that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long CoT
data significantly improves MLLM reasoning. Furthermore, we observe that after
this initial SFT phase, MLLMs can achieve additional performance gains through
a subsequent RL stage. We conclude that a SFT stage with long CoT data is a
critical prerequisite for developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight
MLLMs.

Abstract: Astrocytes are critical glial cells whose altered morphology and density are
hallmarks of many neurological disorders. However, their intricate branching
and stain dependent variability make automated detection of histological images
a highly challenging task. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid CNN
Transformer detector that combines local feature extraction with global
contextual reasoning. A heatmap guided query mechanism generates spatially
grounded anchors for small and faint astrocytes, while a lightweight
Transformer module improves discrimination in dense clusters. Evaluated on
ALDH1L1 and GFAP stained astrocyte datasets, the model consistently
outperformed Faster R-CNN, YOLOv11 and DETR, achieving higher sensitivity with
fewer false positives, as confirmed by FROC analysis. These results highlight
the potential of hybrid CNN Transformer architectures for robust astrocyte
detection and provide a foundation for advanced computational pathology tools.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfraDiffusion是一个零样本框架，通过虚拟相机将砖石点云投影为深度图，并使用DDNM进行恢复，无需任务特定训练即可提升深度图的视觉清晰度和几何一致性，显著改善了砖块级分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低光照环境（如砖石隧道）中获取高分辨率RGB图像不切实际，而点云虽然对暗光环境鲁棒，但通常是非结构化、稀疏且嘈杂的，限制了细粒度分割。需要一种方法能够利用点云数据进行精细的砖块级缺陷检测。

Method: 提出InfraDiffusion框架：1）使用虚拟相机将砖石点云投影为深度图；2）采用去噪扩散零空间模型（DDNM）恢复深度图；3）无需任务特定训练即可增强深度图的视觉清晰度和几何一致性；4）使用Segment Anything Model（SAM）进行砖块级分割。

Result: 在砖石桥梁和隧道点云数据集上的实验表明，该方法在砖块级分割方面取得了显著改进，证明了其在砖石资产自动化检测方面的潜力。

Conclusion: InfraDiffusion通过将点云转换为深度图并利用扩散模型进行增强，成功解决了低光照环境下砖石结构细粒度分割的挑战，为零样本基础设施监测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used for infrastructure monitoring by providing
geometric information, where segmentation is required for downstream tasks such
as defect detection. Existing research has automated semantic segmentation of
structural components, while brick-level segmentation (identifying defects such
as spalling and mortar loss) has been primarily conducted from RGB images.
However, acquiring high-resolution images is impractical in low-light
environments like masonry tunnels. Point clouds, though robust to dim lighting,
are typically unstructured, sparse, and noisy, limiting fine-grained
segmentation. We present InfraDiffusion, a zero-shot framework that projects
masonry point clouds into depth maps using virtual cameras and restores them by
adapting the Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM). Without task-specific
training, InfraDiffusion enhances visual clarity and geometric consistency of
depth maps. Experiments on masonry bridge and tunnel point cloud datasets show
significant improvements in brick-level segmentation using the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), underscoring its potential for automated inspection of masonry
assets. Our code and data is available at

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法难以同时表征全局依赖和局部一致性，无法兼顾长程交互和边界细节的保持

Method: 使用Transformer捕捉全局依赖，引入内容自适应图神经网络增强局部关系，集成多传播阶次动态学习图结构，采用图残差机制保持全局信息和稳定训练

Result: 实验结果表明该方法优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: T-CAGU框架有效解决了高光谱解混中全局与局部特征平衡的问题，在噪声鲁棒性和性能方面表现突出

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) targets to decompose each mixed pixel in remote
sensing images into a set of endmembers and their corresponding abundances.
Despite significant progress in this field using deep learning, most methods
fail to simultaneously characterize global dependencies and local consistency,
making it difficult to preserve both long-range interactions and boundary
details. This letter proposes a novel transformer-guided content-adaptive graph
unmixing framework (T-CAGU), which overcomes these challenges by employing a
transformer to capture global dependencies and introducing a content-adaptive
graph neural network to enhance local relationships. Unlike previous work,
T-CAGU integrates multiple propagation orders to dynamically learn the graph
structure, ensuring robustness against noise. Furthermore, T-CAGU leverages a
graph residual mechanism to preserve global information and stabilize training.
Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/T-CAGU.

Motivation: Vision Transformers在图像分类中表现优异但计算成本高昂，需要在不损失精度的情况下降低大型ViT模型的推理成本

Method: 提出TinyDrop训练免费token丢弃框架，使用轻量级视觉模型在推理时估计token重要性，选择性丢弃低重要性token以减少注意力计算

Result: 在标准图像分类基准测试中，该框架可将ViT的FLOPs减少高达80%，同时保持最小的精度下降

Conclusion: TinyDrop具有即插即用特性，无需架构修改，兼容多种ViT架构，展现了其泛化能力和在高效ViT分类中的实用价值

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve strong performance in image classification
but incur high computational costs from processing all image tokens. To reduce
inference costs in large ViTs without compromising accuracy, we propose
TinyDrop, a training-free token dropping framework guided by a lightweight
vision model. The guidance model estimates the importance of tokens while
performing inference, thereby selectively discarding low-importance tokens if
large vit models need to perform attention calculations. The framework operates
plug-and-play, requires no architectural modifications, and is compatible with
diverse ViT architectures. Evaluations on standard image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework reduces FLOPs by up to 80% for ViTs
with minimal accuracy degradation, highlighting its generalization capability
and practical utility for efficient ViT-based classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标在概念定制评估中覆盖面过窄或过于广泛，与人类偏好存在偏差，特别是多概念评估更加复杂难以量化

Method: 提出分解式GPT评分(D-GPTScore)，将评估标准细化为多个方面，使用多模态大语言模型进行方面级判断，并构建包含单概念和多概念任务的标准化数据集

Result: 在CC-AlignBench标准化数据集上，D-GPTScore方法显著超过现有方法，与人类偏好的相关性更高

Conclusion: 这项工作为概念定制评估建立了新标准，并指出了未来研究的关键挑战

Abstract: Evaluating concept customization is challenging, as it requires a
comprehensive assessment of fidelity to generative prompts and concept images.
Moreover, evaluating multiple concepts is considerably more difficult than
evaluating a single concept, as it demands detailed assessment not only for
each individual concept but also for the interactions among concepts. While
humans can intuitively assess generated images, existing metrics often provide
either overly narrow or overly generalized evaluations, resulting in
misalignment with human preference. To address this, we propose Decomposed GPT
Score (D-GPTScore), a novel human-aligned evaluation method that decomposes
evaluation criteria into finer aspects and incorporates aspect-wise assessments
using Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Additionally, we release Human
Preference-Aligned Concept Customization Benchmark (CC-AlignBench), a benchmark
dataset containing both single- and multi-concept tasks, enabling stage-wise
evaluation across a wide difficulty range -- from individual actions to
multi-person interactions. Our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches on this benchmark, exhibiting higher correlation with human
preferences. This work establishes a new standard for evaluating concept
customization and highlights key challenges for future research. The benchmark

Motivation: 医疗应用本质上是多模态的，但不同临床环境的模态可能不同。乳腺癌分子分型作为重要的临床任务，能够从多模态数据整合中获益，为个急化治疗和改善预后提供支持。

Method: 提出了一种可扩展的松耦合多模态框架，能够无缝整合CNV、临床记录和组织病理图像。引入了双重WSI表征方法，结合传统图像基于和图象基于的表征。还提出了新的多模态融合策略。

Result: 结果显示，将双重WSI表征与CNV和临床健康记录相结合，以及采用新的流水线和融合策略，在乳腺癌分子分型任务上超过了最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅在乳腺癌分子分型中表现优异，而且具有良好的扩展性，能够轻松整合额外模态，适用于其他癌症类型，不需要重新训练现有模态。

Abstract: Healthcare applications are inherently multimodal, benefiting greatly from
the integration of diverse data sources. However, the modalities available in
clinical settings can vary across different locations and patients. A key area
that stands to gain from multimodal integration is breast cancer molecular
subtyping, an important clinical task that can facilitate personalized
treatment and improve patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a scalable
and loosely-coupled multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates data from
various modalities, including copy number variation (CNV), clinical records,
and histopathology images, to enhance breast cancer subtyping. While our
primary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily
accommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down
with minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities,
making it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a
dual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional
image-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach
results in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new
multimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance
across a range of multimodal conditions. Our comprehensive results show that
integrating our dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health
records, along with our pipeline and fusion strategy, outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping.

TL;DR: 通过时间缩放状态空间模型(SSMs)和传输状态机制，提出了一种可在线处理长视频的密集视频描述方法，减少计算复杂度和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的密集视频描述方法在处理长视频时遇到计算复杂度和内存限制问题，且需要整个视频作为输入，无法进行在线处理。

Method: 提出带有传输状态的状态空间模型(SSMs)，结合SSMs的长序列和递归特性，解决SSMs在很长上下文中无法维持状态的主要限制。

Result: 该方法特别适合在线或流式处理，不需要等待整个视频处理完成。在密集视频描述任务中，使用计算量减少7倍，且能够良好地适应不同视频长度。

Conclusion: 该研究通过扩展SSMs的时间缩放能力，为密集视频描述提供了一种更高效、更实用的在线处理方案。

Abstract: Dense video captioning is a challenging video understanding task which aims
to simultaneously segment the video into a sequence of meaningful consecutive
events and to generate detailed captions to accurately describe each event.
Existing methods often encounter difficulties when working with the long videos
associated with dense video captioning, due to the computational complexity and
memory limitations. Furthermore, traditional approaches require the entire
video as input, in order to produce an answer, which precludes online
processing of the video. We address these challenges by time-scaling
State-Space Models (SSMs) to even longer sequences than before. Our approach,
State-Space Models with Transfer State, combines both the long-sequence and
recurrent properties of SSMs and addresses the main limitation of SSMs which
are otherwise not able to sustain their state for very long contexts,
effectively scaling SSMs further in time. The proposed model is particularly
suitable for generating captions on-the-fly, in an online or streaming manner,
without having to wait for the full video to be processed, which is more
beneficial in practice. When applied to dense video captioning, our approach
scales well with video lengths and uses 7x fewer FLOPs.

Conclusion: 该多模态框架通过文本增强语义对齐、动态平衡模态贡献和正则化优化，有效提升了从EEG信号解码视觉神经表征的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we propose an innovative framework that integrates EEG, image,
and text data, aiming to decode visual neural representations from low
signal-to-noise ratio EEG signals. Specifically, we introduce text modality to
enhance the semantic correspondence between EEG signals and visual content.
With the explicit semantic labels provided by text, image and EEG features of
the same category can be more closely aligned with the corresponding text
representations in a shared multimodal space. To fully utilize pre-trained
visual and textual representations, we propose an adapter module that
alleviates the instability of high-dimensional representation while
facilitating the alignment and fusion of cross-modal features. Additionally, to
alleviate the imbalance in multimodal feature contributions introduced by the
textual representations, we propose a Modal Consistency Dynamic Balance (MCDB)
strategy that dynamically adjusts the contribution weights of each modality. We
further propose a stochastic perturbation regularization (SPR) term to enhance
the generalization ability of semantic perturbation-based models by introducing
dynamic Gaussian noise in the modality optimization process. The evaluation
results on the ThingsEEG dataset show that our method surpasses previous
state-of-the-art methods in both Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy metrics, improving by
2.0\% and 4.7\% respectively.

Motivation: 解决边缘设备资源有限的实际场景下，需要一种无需集成方法或测试时增强的高效道路缺陷检测方法，以减少车辆损坏。

Method: 提出JTGD方法，聚合训练生成器和检测器。使用双判别器确保生成的缺陷补丁和整体图像的真实性，采用CLIP基础的Fréchet Inception Distance损失提升图像质量，通过生成更难的样本来增强检测器。

Result: 在RDD2022道路缺陷检测标准上超越了最新方法，仅使用竞争基线20%以下的参数量，适合边缘设备部署。

Conclusion: JTGD通过聚合训练生成器和检测器，在不依赖集成方法的情况下实现了高效的道路缺陷检测，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: Road defect detection is important for road authorities to reduce the vehicle
damage caused by road defects. Considering the practical scenarios where the
defect detectors are typically deployed on edge devices with limited memory and
computational resource, we aim at performing road defect detection without
using ensemble-based methods or test-time augmentation (TTA). To this end, we
propose to Jointly Train the image Generator and Detector for road defect
detection (dubbed as JTGD). We design the dual discriminators for the
generative model to enforce both the synthesized defect patches and overall
images to look plausible. The synthesized image quality is improved by our
proposed CLIP-based Fr\'echet Inception Distance loss. The generative model in
JTGD is trained jointly with the detector to encourage the generative model to
synthesize harder examples for the detector. Since harder synthesized images of
better quality caused by the aforesaid design are used in the data
augmentation, JTGD outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the RDD2022 road
defect detection benchmark across various countries under the condition of no
ensemble and TTA. JTGD only uses less than 20% of the number of parameters
compared with the competing baseline, which makes it more suitable for
deployment on edge devices in practice.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel parameter-efficient adaptation method for
No- Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) using visual prompts optimized
in pixel-space. Unlike full fine-tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models

these visual prompts are combined with images via addition and processed by
mPLUG-Owl2 with the textual query "Rate the technical quality of the image."
Evaluations across distortion types (synthetic, realistic, AI-generated) on
KADID- 10k, KonIQ-10k, and AGIQA-3k demonstrate competitive performance against
full finetuned methods and specialized NR-IQA models, achieving 0.93 SRCC on
KADID-10k. To our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage pixel-space

Conclusion: 纯自回归建模是构建统一多模态智能的充分且优雅的基础，OneCAT证明了这种方法在性能、效率和架构简洁性方面的优势。

Abstract: We introduce OneCAT, a unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates
understanding, generation, and editing within a novel, pure decoder-only
transformer architecture. Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for
external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer
during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for
high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR)
objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we
pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language
Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based
methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings
demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a
sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a
result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing
open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal
generation, editing, and understanding.

Abstract: Benchmarking multi-object tracking and object detection model performance is
an essential step in machine learning model development, as it allows
researchers to evaluate model detection and tracker performance on
human-generated 'test' data, facilitating consistent comparisons between models
and trackers and aiding performance optimization. In this study, a novel
benchmark video dataset was developed and used to assess the performance of
several Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute object detection models and a
FathomNet single-class object detection model together with several trackers.
The dataset consists of four video sequences representing midwater and benthic
deep-sea habitats. Performance was evaluated using Higher Order Tracking
Accuracy, a metric that balances detection, localization, and association
accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available
benchmark for multi-object tracking in deep-sea video footage. We provide the
benchmark data, a clearly documented workflow for generating additional
benchmark videos, as well as example Python notebooks for computing metrics.

Abstract: Next-generation AI companions must go beyond general video understanding to
resolve spatial and temporal references in dynamic, real-world environments.
Existing Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of
coarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal
reasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for
temporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object
references and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a
synthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs
with spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces
diverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates
temporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and
temporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their
locations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our
approach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal
references, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for
real-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human
annotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental
evaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform
baselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally,
these models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new
foundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs.

Motivation: 目前缺乏专门研究笔迹遗传特性的数据库，需要建立一个全面的数据集来探索笔迹是否具有遗传性以及家族关系如何影响书写风格。

Method: 通过专门设计的表格收集210个家庭（包括祖父母、父母、叔伯姑姨、兄弟姐妹、堂表亲、侄子侄女等）的手写样本，包括数字、字母、形状和自由段落，并记录所有书写者的家族关系。

Result: 建立了首个此类笔迹遗传数据库，通过对家庭成员笔迹特征的比较研究，发现了他们书写风格和特征之间的相似性模式。

Conclusion: 该数据库免费向模式识别社区开放，将为研究遗传和家族关系对笔迹的影响开辟新的研究途径。

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive database for research and investigation
on the effects of inheritance on handwriting. A database has been created that
can be used to answer questions such as: Is there a genetic component to
handwriting? Is handwriting inherited? Do family relationships affect
handwriting? Varieties of samples of handwritten components such as: digits,
letters, shapes and free paragraphs of 210 families including (grandparents,
parents, uncles, aunts, siblings, cousins, nephews and nieces) have been
collected using specially designed forms, and family relationships of all
writers are captured. To the best of our knowledge, no such database is
presently available. Based on comparisons and investigation of features of
handwritings of family members, similarities among their features and writing
styles are detected. Our database is freely available to the pattern
recognition community and hope it will pave the way for investigations on the
effects of inheritance and family relationships on handwritings.

TL;DR: T2I-CoReBench是一个全面的文本到图像生成基准测试，评估模型的组合和推理能力，包含1080个复杂提示和13500个检查问题，发现现有模型在复杂场景中的组合能力有限，推理能力更是瓶颈


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I基准测试在评估组合和推理能力方面存在局限性，无法全面评估模型的核心能力，且当前基准测试的场景密度低、推理简单，无法满足复杂真实场景的需求

Method: 构建包含12维评估分类法的综合基准测试，围绕场景图元素（实例、属性、关系）构建组合能力评估，围绕哲学推理框架（演绎、归纳、溯因）构建推理能力评估，每个提示都配有高组合密度和多步推理

Result: 对27个当前T2I模型的实验表明，它们在复杂高密度场景中的组合能力仍然有限，推理能力更是严重滞后，所有模型都难以从提示中推断隐含元素

Conclusion: T2I-CoReBench提供了一个全面复杂的基准测试，揭示了当前T2I模型在组合和推理能力方面的局限性，特别是推理能力成为关键瓶颈，需要进一步研究改进

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation aims to synthesize images from textual
prompts, which jointly specify what must be shown and imply what can be
inferred, thereby corresponding to two core capabilities: composition and
reasoning. However, with the emerging advances of T2I models in reasoning
beyond composition, existing benchmarks reveal clear limitations in providing
comprehensive evaluations across and within these capabilities. Meanwhile,
these advances also enable models to handle more complex prompts, whereas
current benchmarks remain limited to low scene density and simplified
one-to-one reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-CoReBench, a
comprehensive and complex benchmark that evaluates both composition and
reasoning capabilities of T2I models. To ensure comprehensiveness, we structure
composition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, and relation) and
reasoning around the philosophical framework of inference (deductive,
inductive, and abductive), formulating a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy. To
increase complexity, driven by the inherent complexities of real-world
scenarios, we curate each prompt with high compositional density for
composition and multi-step inference for reasoning. We also pair each prompt
with a checklist that specifies individual yes/no questions to assess each
intended element independently to facilitate fine-grained and reliable
evaluation. In statistics, our benchmark comprises 1,080 challenging prompts
and around 13,500 checklist questions. Experiments across 27 current T2I models
reveal that their composition capability still remains limited in complex
high-density scenarios, while the reasoning capability lags even further behind
as a critical bottleneck, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements
from prompts. Our project page: https://t2i-corebench.github.io/.
