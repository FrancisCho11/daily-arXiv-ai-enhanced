Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）下一词概率（NTP）的轻量级幻觉检测方法，通过训练传统机器学习模型来快速识别VLM生成文本中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型的幻觉问题（视觉内容与生成文本不匹配）严重影响了模型的可靠性。现有的检测方法通常使用VLM本身或其他模型来评估生成输出，但这种方法计算量大且会增加模型延迟。

Method: 利用VLM的下一词概率（NTP）作为模型不确定性的直接量化指标，假设高不确定性（低NTP值）与幻觉密切相关。构建了包含1,400条人工标注语句的数据集，训练轻量级ML模型进行幻觉检测。还探索了将语言NTP（仅输入生成文本）和VLM幻觉预测分数集成到NTP模型中的方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于NTP的特征是有效的幻觉预测指标，使简单ML模型能够达到与强大VLM相当的性能。结合语言NTP和VLM预测分数能进一步提升检测性能。

Conclusion: 这项研究为开发简单、轻量级的解决方案铺平了道路，能够有效提升视觉语言模型的可靠性，避免计算密集型的传统检测方法。

Abstract: Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments
between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs.
One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different
one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and
increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly
method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over
signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a
direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high
uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations.
To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements
derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and
use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that
NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and
simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.
Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding
only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection
performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs
into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or
NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions
that enhance the reliability of VLMs.

### [2] [Quasi-Synthetic Riemannian Data Generation for Writer-Independent Offline Signature Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20420)
*Elias N. Zois,Moises Diaz,Salem Said,Miguel A. Ferrer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于黎曼几何的准合成数据生成框架，用于解决离线手写签名验证中跨个体泛化的挑战，通过在SPD矩阵空间生成合成数据来训练独立于书写者的验证系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线手写签名验证在独立于书写者的设置中面临泛化挑战，传统方法依赖真实数据集训练分类器，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 利用SPD矩阵的黎曼几何特性，通过Riemannian Gaussian Mixture模型在SPD空间生成准合成数据，包括正负样本，然后使用度量学习框架进行训练。

Result: 在两个流行的签名数据集（西方和亚洲书写风格）上的实验表明，该方法在数据集内和跨数据集评估协议下都能实现低错误率。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在黎曼空间中生成合成数据对于独立于书写者的签名验证系统的潜力，为解决数据稀缺和泛化问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Offline handwritten signature verification remains a challenging task,
particularly in writer-independent settings where models must generalize across
unseen individuals. Recent developments have highlighted the advantage of
geometrically inspired representations, such as covariance descriptors on
Riemannian manifolds. However, past or present, handcrafted or data-driven
methods usually depend on real-world signature datasets for classifier
training. We introduce a quasi-synthetic data generation framework leveraging
the Riemannian geometry of Symmetric Positive Definite matrices (SPD). A small
set of genuine samples in the SPD space is the seed to a Riemannian Gaussian
Mixture which identifies Riemannian centers as synthetic writers and variances
as their properties. Riemannian Gaussian sampling on each center generates
positive as well as negative synthetic SPD populations. A metric learning
framework utilizes pairs of similar and dissimilar SPD points, subsequently
testing it over on real-world datasets. Experiments conducted on two popular
signature datasets, encompassing Western and Asian writing styles, demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed approach under both intra- and cross- dataset
evaluation protocols. The results indicate that our quasi-synthetic approach
achieves low error rates, highlighting the potential of generating synthetic
data in Riemannian spaces for writer-independent signature verification
systems.

TL;DR: Seedream 4.0是一个高效的多模态图像生成系统，统一了文本到图像合成、图像编辑和多图像组合功能，采用扩散变换器和优化的VAE实现快速高分辨率图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统T2I系统功能单一，需要开发一个统一的框架来整合多种图像生成和编辑任务，提供更交互式和多维度的创作工具。

Method: 使用高效的扩散变换器和强大的VAE减少图像token数量，通过数十亿文本-图像对预训练，结合对抗蒸馏、分布匹配、量化和推测解码等技术加速推理。

Result: 在生成2K图像时推理时间可达1.8秒，在T2I和多模态图像编辑任务上达到最先进水平，支持复杂任务如精确图像编辑和上下文推理。

Conclusion: Seedream 4.0将传统T2I系统扩展为更交互式的多维创作工具，推动了生成AI在创意和专业应用领域的边界。

Abstract: We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image
generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing,
and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly
efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the
number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our
model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g.,
1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning
diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data
collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized
strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong
generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform
multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks
jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation,
distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It
achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image
(without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream
4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image
editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in
complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and
also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images.
This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and
multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both
creativity and professional applications. Seedream 4.0 is now accessible on
https://www.volcengine.com/experience/ark?launch=seedream.

### [4] [A Contrastive Learning Framework for Breast Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20474)
*Samia Saeed,Khuram Naveed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于对比学习的乳腺癌检测框架，使用半监督方法在有限标注数据下实现96.7%的准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是全球第二大癌症死因，早期检测对治疗至关重要。深度学习虽然有效但受限于标注数据不足，因此需要开发在小标注数据集上表现优异的方法

Method: 采用对比学习框架，使用Resnet-50在半监督模式下训练，利用大量未标注乳腺X光片数据，通过相似性指数和各种数据增强技术提升性能

Result: 在INbreast和MIAS基准数据集上实现了96.7%的乳腺癌检测准确率，超越了现有最优方法

Conclusion: 对比学习框架在小标注数据集上表现出色，为乳腺癌早期检测提供了有效的解决方案，具有重要的临床应用价值

Abstract: Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally,
accounts for a quarter of all cancer cases [1]. To lower this death rate, it is
crucial to detect tumors early, as early-stage detection significantly improves
treatment outcomes. Advances in non-invasive imaging techniques have made early
detection possible through computer-aided detection (CAD) systems which rely on
traditional image analysis to identify malignancies. However, there is a
growing shift towards deep learning methods due to their superior
effectiveness. Despite their potential, deep learning methods often struggle
with accuracy due to the limited availability of large-labeled datasets for
training. To address this issue, our study introduces a Contrastive Learning
(CL) framework, which excels with smaller labeled datasets. In this regard, we
train Resnet-50 in semi supervised CL approach using similarity index on a
large amount of unlabeled mammogram data. In this regard, we use various
augmentation and transformations which help improve the performance of our
approach. Finally, we tune our model on a small set of labelled data that
outperforms the existing state of the art. Specifically, we observed a 96.7%
accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS.

### [5] [Are Foundation Models Ready for Industrial Defect Recognition? A Reality Check on Real-World Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20479)
*Simon Baeuerle,Pratik Khanna,Nils Friederich,Angelo Jovin Yamachui Sitcheu,Damir Shakirov,Andreas Steimer,Ralf Mikut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文测试了多个基础模型在工业图像质量检测中的应用，发现这些模型在公开数据集上表现良好，但在真实工业数据上全部失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用基础模型的零样本泛化能力替代繁琐的人工标注，实现跨产品的自动化质量检测，以节省模型部署成本。

Method: 在定制真实工业图像数据和公共图像数据上测试多个最新基础模型，比较它们在零样本设置下的性能表现。

Result: 所有测试的基础模型在真实工业数据上均失败，而相同的模型在公共基准数据集上表现良好。

Conclusion: 基础模型在工业质量检测场景中的实际应用仍面临挑战，需要针对工业场景的专门优化。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have shown impressive performance on various text and
image processing tasks. They can generalize across domains and datasets in a
zero-shot setting. This could make them suitable for automated quality
inspection during series manufacturing, where various types of images are being
evaluated for many different products. Replacing tedious labeling tasks with a
simple text prompt to describe anomalies and utilizing the same models across
many products would save significant efforts during model setup and
implementation. This is a strong advantage over supervised Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models, which are trained for individual applications and
require labeled training data. We test multiple recent FMs on both custom
real-world industrial image data and public image data. We show that all of
those models fail on our real-world data, while the very same models perform
well on public benchmark datasets.

### [6] [Shared Neural Space: Unified Precomputed Feature Encoding for Multi-Task and Cross Domain Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20481)
*Jing Li,Oskar Bartosz,Chengyu Wang,Michal Wnuczynski,Dilshan Godaliyadda,Michael Polley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出通用神经空间(NS)框架，通过编码器-解码器架构预计算跨视觉和成像任务的特征，使多个下游AI模块共享同一特征空间，减少冗余并提高跨域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型多为特定高精度任务定制，对于需要执行一系列模块化任务的应用效率低下，因为每个任务都需要映射到不同的潜在域。

Method: 使用轻量级CNN骨干网络构建编码器-解码器框架，编码器学习变换感知、可泛化的表示，多个下游模块在共享的神经空间中进行操作。

Result: 演示了去马赛克、去噪、深度估计和语义分割等成像和视觉模块可以在NS中高效执行，架构减少了冗余并改善了跨域泛化。

Conclusion: 该通用神经空间为高效的多任务视觉管道奠定了基础，相比大型transformer骨干网络更轻量，具有更广泛的硬件兼容性。

Abstract: The majority of AI models in imaging and vision are customized to perform on
specific high-precision task. However, this strategy is inefficient for
applications with a series of modular tasks, since each requires a mapping into
a disparate latent domain. To address this inefficiency, we proposed a
universal Neural Space (NS), where an encoder-decoder framework pre-computes
features across vision and imaging tasks. Our encoder learns transformation
aware, generalizable representations, which enable multiple downstream AI
modules to share the same feature space. This architecture reduces redundancy,
improves generalization across domain shift, and establishes a foundation for
effecient multi-task vision pipelines. Furthermore, as opposed to larger
transformer backbones, our backbone is lightweight and CNN-based, allowing for
wider across hardware. We furthur demonstrate that imaging and vision modules,
such as demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation and semantic segmentation can
be performed efficiently in the NS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究如何在边缘设备上选择最有用的训练图像，以在保持低传输成本的同时最大化模型质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘相机系统不断扩展，面临不断变化的环境，需要定期更新模型。实践中，复杂教师模型在中央服务器上运行以标注数据，然后用于训练适应有限计算能力的边缘设备的小型模型。

Method: 采用高置信度流式策略与基于多样性的方法相结合，选择最有用的图像进行训练。

Result: 在相似的训练负载下，该方法能够以最少的数据库查询产生高质量的模型。

Conclusion: 高置信度流式策略与多样性方法的结合是优化边缘设备模型训练的有效途径。

Abstract: Edge camera-based systems are continuously expanding, facing ever-evolving
environments that require regular model updates. In practice, complex teacher
models are run on a central server to annotate data, which is then used to
train smaller models tailored to the edge devices with limited computational
power. This work explores how to select the most useful images for training to
maximize model quality while keeping transmission costs low. Our work shows
that, for a similar training load (i.e., iterations), a high-confidence
stream-based strategy coupled with a diversity-based approach produces a
high-quality model with minimal dataset queries.

### [8] [InstructVTON: Optimal Auto-Masking and Natural-Language-Guided Interactive Style Control for Inpainting-Based Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20524)
*Julien Han,Shuwen Qiu,Qi Li,Xingzi Xu,Mehmet Saygin Seyfioglu,Kavosh Asadi,Karim Bouyarmane*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructVTON是一个基于指令的交互式虚拟试穿系统，通过自然语言指导实现细粒度和复杂样式控制，利用视觉语言模型和图像分割模型自动生成二进制掩码，简化用户操作并提升试穿效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于掩码的虚拟试穿方法需要用户精确绘制掩码，操作复杂且在某些场景下无法实现（如卷起袖子等样式变化），限制了用户体验和生成效果。

Method: 结合视觉语言模型和图像分割模型，根据用户提供的图像和自由文本样式指令自动生成二进制掩码，实现无需精确掩码绘制的虚拟试穿，并与现有虚拟试穿模型兼容。

Result: InstructVTON能够实现现有虚拟试穿模型无法完成的复杂样式控制，达到最先进的生成效果，并简化用户操作流程。

Conclusion: 该系统通过自然语言指令和自动化掩码生成，显著提升了虚拟试穿的灵活性和用户体验，为复杂样式控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present InstructVTON, an instruction-following interactive virtual try-on
system that allows fine-grained and complex styling control of the resulting
generation, guided by natural language, on single or multiple garments. A
computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates
the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These
inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control
the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is
difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some
cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve
shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt
with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve).
InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation
models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on
user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies
the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask,
and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on
scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models
alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on
models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepAFRNet是一个深度学习模型，用于识别被篡改的指纹，在SOCOFing数据集上对不同难度级别的篡改指纹实现了高精度识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指纹识别在边境控制、法医学和财政准入等应用中面临挑战，攻击者可能故意修改脊线模式以逃避检测，因此需要能够识别篡改指纹的鲁棒系统。

Method: 使用VGG16骨干网络提取高维特征，通过余弦相似度比较嵌入向量，在SOCOFing Real-Altered子集的三个难度级别（简单、中等、困难）上进行评估。

Result: 在严格阈值下，DeepAFRNet在三个难度级别上的准确率分别为96.7%、98.76%和99.54%。阈值敏感性研究表明，将阈值从0.92放宽到0.72会导致准确率急剧下降至7.86%、27.05%和29.51%。

Conclusion: DeepAFRNet通过使用真实篡改样本和报告逐级指标，解决了先前基于合成篡改或有限验证协议的研究的局限性，表明其已准备好用于安全性和识别弹性都至关重要的实际部署。

Abstract: Altered fingerprint recognition (AFR) is challenging for biometric
verification in applications such as border control, forensics, and fiscal
admission. Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade
detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present
DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes
distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract
high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We
evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels
(Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of
96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A
threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72
sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent,
underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By
using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet
addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited
verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments
where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

Motivation: 利用预训练视觉变换器的注意力图提供像素级显著性分数，为机器人操作任务提供语义线索

Method: 从自监督ViT模型DINOv2提取注意力图，将其解释为RGB图像的像素级显著性分数，然后提升到3D体素网格中，集成到行为克隆策略中

Result: 在RLBench双手基准测试中，注意力引导的特征化方法在所有任务上实现了8.2%的绝对改进和21.9%的相对增益

Conclusion: 注意力图集成到体素表示中能显著提升双手机器人操作的性能

Abstract: We investigate the integration of attention maps from a pre-trained Vision
Transformer into voxel representations to enhance bimanual robotic
manipulation. Specifically, we extract attention maps from DINOv2, a
self-supervised ViT model, and interpret them as pixel-level saliency scores
over RGB images. These maps are lifted into a 3D voxel grid, resulting in
voxel-level semantic cues that are incorporated into a behavior cloning policy.
When integrated into a state-of-the-art voxel-based policy, our
attention-guided featurization yields an average absolute improvement of 8.2%
and a relative gain of 21.9% across all tasks in the RLBench bimanual
benchmark.

*Xinyang Mu,Yuzhen Lu,Boyang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究对YOLO和RT-DETR系列的36个实时目标检测模型进行了比较分析，评估其在蓝莓检测任务上的性能，并使用半监督学习进一步提升检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然环境中蓝莓检测面临光照变化、遮挡和运动模糊等挑战，需要大规模多样化数据集和合适的精度/速度/内存权衡的检测模型。

Method: 使用包含85,879个标注实例的新数据集，评估YOLO(v8-v12)和RT-DETR(v1-v2)共36个模型变体，并采用无偏均值教师半监督学习在1,035张未标记图像上进行微调。

Result: YOLOv12m达到93.3% mAP@50，RT-DETRv2-X达到93.6% mAP@50。半监督学习微调后，RT-DETR-v2-X取得最佳性能94.8% mAP@50。

Conclusion: 中等规模模型在精度和速度间达到良好平衡，半监督学习能进一步提升性能，但需要更深入研究以更好利用跨域未标记数据。

Abstract: Blueberry detection in natural environments remains challenging due to
variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur due to environmental factors and
imaging devices. Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these
challenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the
real-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical
scenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model
selection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of
advanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once)
(v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families,
consisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for
blueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with
smartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled
instances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide
range of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the
YOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while
RT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR
variants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and
the mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To
further enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using
Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of
1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in
2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with
RT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%. More in-depth research into
SSL is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data. Both the dataset
and software programs of this study are made publicly available to support
further research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种轻量级的感兴趣区域(ROI)增强策略，用于改善乳腺X光片分类性能，在Mini-DDSM数据集上实现了适度的ROC-AUC提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺X光筛查对早期检测和降低死亡率至关重要，但深度学习在乳腺X光片解读中受到有限分辨率数据集和小样本量的限制。

Method: 在训练过程中，使用预计算的、无标签的边界框库中的随机ROI裁剪概率性地替换完整图像，并可选地添加抖动以增加变异性。

Result: 在Mini-DDSM数据集上，ROI增强（最佳参数：p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10）产生了适度的平均ROC-AUC增益，性能在不同折叠间有所变化；PR-AUC持平或略有下降。

Conclusion: 结果表明，简单、以数据为中心的ROI策略可以在不需要额外标签或架构修改的受限设置中增强乳腺X光片分类。

Abstract: Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection
and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for
automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small
sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset
(9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest
(ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically
replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free
bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate
under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and
training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI
augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On
Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest
average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to
slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI
strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings
without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

TL;DR: 利用镜面反射作为辅助视角，通过物理有效的虚拟相机变换实现单图像多视角立体视觉，简化3D重建过程并兼容前馈重建模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 镜面反射在日常环境中常见，能提供单次拍摄中的立体信息，通过利用反射作为辅助视角来简化3D重建过程

Method: 设计物理有效的虚拟相机变换来生成虚拟视角，提出对称感知损失来优化姿态估计，框架可扩展到动态场景

Result: 在真实世界和合成数据上的广泛实验证明了方法的有效性，提供了包含16个Blender场景的可定制合成数据集

Conclusion: 该方法能够从单张包含镜面反射的图像实现鲁棒的3D重建，简化了成像过程并提高了重建的通用性

Abstract: Mirror reflections are common in everyday environments and can provide stereo
information within a single capture, as the real and reflected virtual views
are visible simultaneously. We exploit this property by treating the reflection
as an auxiliary view and designing a transformation that constructs a
physically valid virtual camera, allowing direct pixel-domain generation of the
virtual view while adhering to the real-world imaging process. This enables a
multi-view stereo setup from a single image, simplifying the imaging process,
making it compatible with powerful feed-forward reconstruction models for
generalizable and robust 3D reconstruction. To further exploit the geometric
symmetry introduced by mirrors, we propose a symmetric-aware loss to refine
pose estimation. Our framework also naturally extends to dynamic scenes, where
each frame contains a mirror reflection, enabling efficient per-frame geometry
recovery. For quantitative evaluation, we provide a fully customizable
synthetic dataset of 16 Blender scenes, each with ground-truth point clouds and
camera poses. Extensive experiments on real-world data and synthetic data are
conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 灾后建筑占用情况评估对分类、检查、公用事业恢复和资源分配至关重要。现有方法中，航拍图像覆盖快但缺乏立面细节，街景图像细节丰富但稀疏且难以与地块对齐。

Method: 提出FacadeTrack框架，包括全景视频与地块链接、立面视图矫正、可解释属性提取（如入口堵塞、临时覆盖物、局部碎片），采用两种决策策略：透明的一阶段规则和将感知与保守推理分离的两阶段设计。

Result: 在两次飓风Helene灾后调查中，两阶段方法达到精度0.927、召回率0.781、F-1分数0.848，优于一阶段基线的精度0.943、召回率0.728、F-1分数0.822。中间属性和空间诊断揭示了错误来源。

Conclusion: 该管道提供可审计、可扩展的占用评估，适合集成到地理空间和应急管理工作流程中，通过透明化决策支持质量控制和错误分析。

Abstract: Building-level occupancy after disasters is vital for triage, inspections,
utility re-energization, and equitable resource allocation. Overhead imagery
provides rapid coverage but often misses facade and access cues that determine
habitability, while street-view imagery captures those details but is sparse
and difficult to align with parcels. We present FacadeTrack, a street-level,
language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies
views to facades, and elicits interpretable attributes (for example, entry
blockage, temporary coverings, localized debris) that drive two decision
strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates
perception from conservative reasoning. Evaluated across two post-Hurricane
Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieves a precision of 0.927, a recall
of 0.781, and an F-1 score of 0.848, compared with the one-stage baseline at a
precision of 0.943, a recall of 0.728, and an F-1 score of 0.822. Beyond
accuracy, intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics reveal where and why
residual errors occur, enabling targeted quality control. The pipeline provides
auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into
geospatial and emergency-management workflows.

### [15] [Human Semantic Representations of Social Interactions from Moving Shapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20673)
*Yiling Yun,Hongjing Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨人类如何通过语义表征补充视觉特征来识别社会互动，发现语义模型（特别是基于动词的嵌入）能最好地解释人类相似性判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够从简单的运动形状中识别各种社会互动，但以往研究多关注视觉特征，本研究旨在探索人类使用何种语义表征来补充视觉特征。

Method: 研究1：让参与者直接标记动画印象；研究2：通过人类相似性判断测量27种社会互动的表征几何，并与基于视觉特征、标签和动画描述语义嵌入的模型预测进行比较。

Result: 人类反应呈分布状态；语义模型为解释人类判断提供了视觉特征的补充信息；基于描述的动词嵌入最能解释人类相似性判断。

Conclusion: 简单显示中的社会感知反映了社会互动的语义结构，连接了视觉和抽象表征。

Abstract: Humans are social creatures who readily recognize various social interactions
from simple display of moving shapes. While previous research has often focused
on visual features, we examine what semantic representations that humans employ
to complement visual features. In Study 1, we directly asked human participants
to label the animations based on their impression of moving shapes. We found
that human responses were distributed. In Study 2, we measured the
representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity
judgments and compared it with model predictions based on visual features,
labels, and semantic embeddings from animation descriptions. We found that
semantic models provided complementary information to visual features in
explaining human judgments. Among the semantic models, verb-based embeddings
extracted from descriptions account for human similarity judgments the best.
These results suggest that social perception in simple displays reflects the
semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract
representations.

TL;DR: 提出EGS框架解决跨视角地理定位中的两个关键挑战：增强在剧烈外观变化下的鲁棒性，以及建立可靠的全局-局部一致性特征对应关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在无人机不同方向和视野下存在严重外观变化时缺乏鲁棒性，且难以同时捕捉全局场景语义和细粒度局部细节。

Method: 使用E(2)-Steerable CNN编码器提取旋转和视角变化下的稳定特征，构建带虚拟超级节点的图结构实现全局语义聚合和局部一致性。

Result: 在University-1652和SUES-200基准测试中取得显著性能提升，建立了跨域CVGL的新SOTA。

Conclusion: EGS框架通过结合E(2)-Steerable特征提取和图结构建模，有效提升了跨视角地理定位的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) aims to match images of the same location
captured from drastically different viewpoints. Despite recent progress,
existing methods still face two key challenges: (1) achieving robustness under
severe appearance variations induced by diverse UAV orientations and fields of
view, which hinders cross-domain generalization, and (2) establishing reliable
correspondences that capture both global scene-level semantics and fine-grained
local details. In this paper, we propose EGS, a novel CVGL framework designed
to enhance cross-domain generalization. Specifically, we introduce an
E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder to extract stable and reliable features under
rotation and viewpoint shifts. Furthermore, we construct a graph with a virtual
super-node that connects to all local nodes, enabling global semantics to be
aggregated and redistributed to local regions, thereby enforcing global-local
consistency. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200
benchmarks demonstrate that EGS consistently achieves substantial performance
gains and establishes a new state of the art in cross-domain CVGL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外小目标缺乏明显的纹理和形态特征，容易与杂乱的背景融合。现有方法依赖固定梯度算子或简单注意力机制，在低对比度和高噪声环境下难以准确提取目标边缘。

Method: 双路径网络包含双向交互模块（结合局部和全局自注意力）和多边缘细化器（使用级联泰勒有限差分算子）。第一路径捕获多尺度特征依赖，第二路径增强细粒度边缘细节。

Result: 该方法为精确的红外小目标检测和定位提供了有前景的解决方案。

Conclusion: 通过将结构语义和边缘细化结合在统一框架中，有效解决了特征对齐问题，提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection is crucial for remote sensing applications
like disaster warning and maritime surveillance. However, due to the lack of
distinctive texture and morphological features, infrared small targets are
highly susceptible to blending into cluttered and noisy backgrounds. A
fundamental challenge in designing deep models for this task lies in the
inherent conflict between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute
targets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, often
leading to feature misalignment and suboptimal performance. Existing methods
often rely on fixed gradient operators or simplistic attention mechanisms,
which are inadequate for accurately extracting target edges under low contrast
and high noise. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Path Edge Network that
explicitly addresses this challenge by decoupling edge enhancement and semantic
modeling into two complementary processing paths. The first path employs a
Bidirectional Interaction Module, which uses both Local Self-Attention and
Global Self-Attention to capture multi-scale local and global feature
dependencies. The global attention mechanism, based on a Transformer
architecture, integrates long-range semantic relationships and contextual
information, ensuring robust scene understanding. The second path introduces
the Multi-Edge Refiner, which enhances fine-grained edge details using cascaded
Taylor finite difference operators at multiple scales. This mathematical
approach, along with an attention-driven gating mechanism, enables precise edge
localization and feature enhancement for targets of varying sizes, while
effectively suppressing noise. Our method provides a promising solution for
precise infrared small target detection and localization, combining structural
semantics and edge refinement in a unified framework.

Motivation: 传统意图识别主要关注个体意图，忽视了群体环境中集体意图的复杂性。为了解决这一局限，需要研究群体意图的识别和预测。

Method: 提出了SHOT数据集（包含1,979个篮球视频片段，5个相机视角，6种个体属性标注）和GIFT框架（提取细粒度个体特征并建模群体动态演化）。

Result: 实验结果表明SHOT数据集和GIFT框架的有效性，为群体意图预测研究奠定了坚实基础。

Conclusion: 该研究开创了群体意图预测的新方向，提出的数据集和框架为未来相关研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Intention recognition has traditionally focused on individual intentions,
overlooking the complexities of collective intentions in group settings. To
address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which
represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals,
and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group
intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before
the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific
scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of
1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6
types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics:
multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level
intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions.
Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that
extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to
forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of
SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group
intention forecasting. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: Neptune-X是一个数据中心的生成-选择框架，通过合成数据生成和任务感知样本选择来解决海上目标检测中的数据稀缺和泛化能力差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海上目标检测面临两个关键挑战：标注数据稀缺以及在不同海上属性（如目标类别、视角、位置和成像环境）上的泛化能力差。现有数据集训练的模型在代表性不足的场景（如公海环境）中表现不佳。

Method: 提出Neptune-X框架，包括两个核心组件：1）X-to-Maritime多模态条件生成模型，通过双向对象-水域注意力模块捕捉对象与水域边界的交互以提高视觉保真度；2）属性相关主动采样方法，根据任务相关性动态选择合成样本。还构建了首个面向生成式海上学习的Maritime Generation Dataset。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在海上场景合成方面设立了新的基准，显著提高了检测准确性，特别是在具有挑战性和先前代表性不足的场景中。

Conclusion: Neptune-X通过生成-选择框架有效解决了海上目标检测中的数据稀缺和泛化问题，为海上视觉任务提供了强大的数据增强解决方案。

Abstract: Maritime object detection is essential for navigation safety, surveillance,
and autonomous operations, yet constrained by two key challenges: the scarcity
of annotated maritime data and poor generalization across various maritime
attributes (e.g., object category, viewpoint, location, and imaging
environment). % In particular, models trained on existing datasets often
underperform in underrepresented scenarios such as open-sea environments. To
address these challenges, we propose Neptune-X, a data-centric
generative-selection framework that enhances training effectiveness by
leveraging synthetic data generation with task-aware sample selection. From the
generation perspective, we develop X-to-Maritime, a multi-modality-conditioned
generative model that synthesizes diverse and realistic maritime scenes. A key
component is the Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module, which captures
boundary interactions between objects and their aquatic surroundings to improve
visual fidelity. To further improve downstream tasking performance, we propose
Attribute-correlated Active Sampling, which dynamically selects synthetic
samples based on their task relevance. To support robust benchmarking, we
construct the Maritime Generation Dataset, the first dataset tailored for
generative maritime learning, encompassing a wide range of semantic conditions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark in
maritime scene synthesis, significantly improving detection accuracy,
particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.The code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的陨石坑导航主要针对短时、高频率的着陆任务，而长期月球测绘任务面临稀疏、倾斜图像和变化光照条件的挑战，需要开发新的导航解决方案。

Method: STELLA结合了Mask R-CNN陨石坑检测器、无描述符陨石坑识别模块、鲁棒的透视n点姿态求解器和批量轨道确定后端。

Result: 在CRESENT-365数据集上的实验表明，STELLA在各种视角、光照条件和月球纬度下平均保持米级位置精度和亚度级姿态精度。

Conclusion: 这是首次在真实月球测绘环境下对陨石坑导航进行全面评估，为未来任务提供了重要的操作条件参考。

Abstract: Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) uses the ubiquitous impact craters of the Moon
observed on images as natural landmarks to determine the six degrees of freedom
pose of a spacecraft. To date, CBN has primarily been studied in the context of
powered descent and landing. These missions are typically short in duration,
with high-frequency imagery captured from a nadir viewpoint over well-lit
terrain. In contrast, lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery
acquired under varying illumination conditions over potentially year-long
campaigns, posing significantly greater challenges for pose estimation. We
bridge this gap with STELLA - the first end-to-end CBN pipeline for
long-duration lunar mapping. STELLA combines a Mask R-CNN-based crater
detector, a descriptor-less crater identification module, a robust
perspective-n-crater pose solver, and a batch orbit determination back-end. To
rigorously test STELLA, we introduce CRESENT-365 - the first public dataset
that emulates a year-long lunar mapping mission. Each of its 15,283 images is
rendered from high-resolution digital elevation models with SPICE-derived Sun
angles and Moon motion, delivering realistic global coverage, illumination
cycles, and viewing geometries. Experiments on CRESENT+ and CRESENT-365 show
that STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude
accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination
conditions, and lunar latitudes. These results constitute the first
comprehensive assessment of CBN in a true lunar mapping setting and inform
operational conditions that should be considered for future missions.

*Zoe Wanying He,Sean Trott,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了仅视觉和仅语言模型在表示空间中的对齐现象，发现对齐出现在中后层网络，反映从模态特定到概念共享表示的转变，这种对齐具有语义性质并与人类判断一致


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度视觉和语言模型在不同模态上训练，但它们将输入投影到部分对齐的表示空间。然而，我们仍不清楚这种对齐在网络的何处出现、支持它的视觉或语言线索是什么、是否捕捉人类在多对多图像-文本场景中的偏好，以及聚合相同概念的示例如何影响对齐

Method: 通过系统调查方法，分析对齐在模型层级的出现位置，测试对齐对仅外观变化和语义变化的鲁棒性，使用强制选择"Pick-a-Pic"任务评估人类偏好与嵌入空间的一致性，并研究示例聚合对对齐的影响

Result: 对齐在两种模型类型的中后层达到峰值；对齐对仅外观变化具有鲁棒性，但在语义改变时崩溃；人类对图像-标题匹配的偏好在所有视觉-语言模型对中反映；平均嵌入跨示例会增强对齐而非模糊细节

Conclusion: 单模态网络收敛于一个共享语义代码，该代码与人类判断一致，并通过示例聚合得到加强，表明深度模型在表示空间中自发发展出跨模态语义对齐

Abstract: Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained
on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially
aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in
each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support
it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios,
and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we
systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in
mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from
modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is
robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered
(e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared
code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a
forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task shows that human preferences for image-caption
matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model
pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to
a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic
distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across
exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our
results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code
that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法在个性化图像合成任务中存在几何控制不足和风格一致性差的问题，需要一种无需大量训练就能实现精确控制的方法

Method: 首先将2D对象转换为3D，在3D层面进行交互式编辑，然后从指定视角重新渲染为2D图像，结合扩散适配器实现几何、风格和内容控制

Result: 该方法能够生成几何控制精确、风格一致的编辑图像，无需额外训练即可实现个性化对象插入

Conclusion: FreeInsert通过引入3D几何信息有效解决了图像编辑中的几何控制和风格一致性问题，为个性化图像合成提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in image
generation, allowing for effortless customized generation. However, existing
image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with
personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of
geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D
space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to
maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the
challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style
consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack
of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without
extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose
\textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object
insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information.
Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert
the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then
re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces
geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as
geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through
diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled,
style-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.

Conclusion: CustomEnhancer框架能够为个性化模型提供精确的无训练控制，统一生成和重建过程，显著提升个性化图像生成的质量和效率

Abstract: Recently remarkable progress has been made in synthesizing realistic human
photos using text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches face
degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We
introduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity
customization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that
leverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain
additional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized
models. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which
identifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to
manipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and
reconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline
also enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of
personalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and
eliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to
address the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce
ResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a
pre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments
demonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity
fidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our
ResInversion over NTI. The code will be made publicly available upon paper
acceptance.

platform incorporated with standard codecs (under development) by examining the
compression gain on several datasets in terms of bit-rate versus task accuracy.
This evaluation platform has been developed as open-source software and is

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) in medical image segmentation
offers a promising solution for generalizing to unseen domains during testing,
addressing domain shift challenges and minimizing annotation costs. However,
conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for
each source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in
practice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the
training set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical
and challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization
(CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training
data, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG
methods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of
inaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel
dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG.
Building upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross
pseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level
supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This
feature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision
caused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing
complementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two
distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to
enhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model
collapse. Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation
datasets, i.e., Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM, demonstrate the robust
generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

TL;DR: DEIMv2是基于DEIM框架的改进版本，通过集成DINOv3特征和引入空间调谐适配器(STA)，在不同规模模型上实现了优越的性能-成本平衡，在目标检测任务中建立了新的最先进结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展DEIM框架以利用DINOv3特征的强大语义表示能力，同时满足从GPU到移动设备的不同部署场景需求，实现更好的性能-成本权衡。

Method: 1) 对X、L、M、S变体采用DINOv3预训练或蒸馏骨干网络，并引入空间调谐适配器(STA)将单尺度输出转换为多尺度特征；2) 对超轻量模型采用HGNetv2并进行深度和宽度剪枝；3) 结合简化解码器和升级的Dense O2O设计。

Result: DEIMv2-X仅用5030万参数达到57.8 AP，超越需要6000万参数才能达到56.5 AP的先前模型；DEIMv2-S成为首个参数量低于1000万但AP超过50的模型(50.9 AP)；DEIMv2-Pico仅用150万参数达到38.5 AP，性能与230万参数的YOLOv10-Nano相当。

Conclusion: DEIMv2通过统一的架构设计在不同规模模型上均实现了卓越的性能，特别是在参数效率方面表现突出，为目标检测任务设定了新的性能基准。

Abstract: Benefiting from the simplicity and effectiveness of Dense O2O and MAL, DEIM
has become the mainstream training framework for real-time DETRs, significantly
outperforming the YOLO series. In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features,
resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering
GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt
DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter
(STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale
features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance
detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we
employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets.
Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified
design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across
diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our
largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters,
surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for
just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model
(9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even
the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers
38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer

*Ved Umrajkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAC-LoRA是一个将对抗训练集成到参数高效微调中的新框架，通过动态对抗课程学习提升视觉语言模型的对抗鲁棒性，同时保持清洁准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在安全关键应用中广泛使用，但现有的参数高效微调方法如LoRA仍容易受到对抗攻击的威胁，可能影响自动驾驶、医疗诊断等关键决策的安全性。

Method: 提出DAC-LoRA框架，集成动态对抗课程学习到PEFT中，基于一阶平稳条件和TRADES损失函数，构建渐进式挑战性攻击的智能课程。

Result: DAC-LoRA在显著提升对抗鲁棒性的同时，没有明显损害清洁准确率，提供了一个轻量级且广泛适用的方法。

Conclusion: 该框架可以轻松集成到标准PEFT流程中，显著增强模型鲁棒性，其核心原则可应用于任何迭代攻击方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like
autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and content moderation. While
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient
adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for
numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can
cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial
Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training
into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of
progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to
any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition
(FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements
in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy.
Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to
demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a
standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为FedDSPG的新方法，通过生成视角处理联邦领域泛化任务，利用领域特定软提示生成来提升模型在未知领域的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于提示学习的联邦领域泛化方法存在提示多样性有限、忽略未知领域信息的问题，需要一种更有效的方法来处理领域偏移挑战。

Method: 在训练阶段为每个领域引入领域特定软提示，将内容和领域知识整合到客户端生成模型中；在推理阶段使用生成器获取未知目标领域的DSPs来指导下游任务。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的综合评估表明，该方法在联邦领域泛化任务中优于现有强基线，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FedDSPG方法从生成视角有效解决了联邦学习中的领域泛化问题，通过领域特定软提示生成显著提升了模型在未知领域的适应能力。

Abstract: Prompt learning has become an efficient paradigm for adapting CLIP to
downstream tasks. Compared with traditional fine-tuning, prompt learning
optimizes a few parameters yet yields highly competitive results, especially
appealing in federated learning for computational efficiency. engendering
domain shift among clients and posing a formidable challenge for
downstream-task adaptation. Existing federated domain generalization (FDG)
methods based on prompt learning typically learn soft prompts from training
samples, replacing manually designed prompts to enhance the generalization
ability of federated models. However, these learned prompts exhibit limited
diversity and tend to ignore information from unknown domains. We propose a
novel and effective method from a generative perspective for handling FDG
tasks, namely federated domain generalization with domain-specific soft prompts
generation (FedDSPG). Specifically, during training, we introduce
domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrate content and
domain knowledge into the generative model among clients. In the inference
phase, the generator is utilized to obtain DSPs for unseen target domains, thus
guiding downstream tasks in unknown domains. Comprehensive evaluations across
several public datasets confirm that our method outperforms existing strong
baselines in FDG, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 全球数百万人受腰痛困扰，需要能够联合分析复杂医学图像和文本报告的强大诊断模型。

Method: 基于对比语言-图像预训练，整合视觉编码器（ResNet-50、Vision Transformer、Swin Transformer）和BERT文本编码器，通过可学习的投影头将特征映射到共享嵌入空间，使用soft CLIP损失进行训练。

Abstract: Low back pain affects millions worldwide, driving the need for robust
diagnostic models that can jointly analyze complex medical images and
accompanying text reports. We present LumbarCLIP, a novel multimodal framework
that leverages contrastive language-image pretraining to align lumbar spine MRI
scans with corresponding radiological descriptions. Built upon a curated
dataset containing axial MRI views paired with expert-written reports,
LumbarCLIP integrates vision encoders (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Swin
Transformer) with a BERT-based text encoder to extract dense representations.
These are projected into a shared embedding space via learnable projection
heads, configurable as linear or non-linear, and normalized to facilitate
stable contrastive training using a soft CLIP loss. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on downstream classification, reaching up to
95.00% accuracy and 94.75% F1-score on the test set, despite inherent class
imbalance. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate that linear projection heads
yield more effective cross-modal alignment than non-linear variants. LumbarCLIP
offers a promising foundation for automated musculoskeletal diagnosis and
clinical decision support.

TL;DR: PoisonVID是首个针对VideoLLMs中提示引导采样策略的黑盒中毒攻击，通过闭环优化策略成功破坏采样机制，攻击成功率高达82%-99%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然VideoLLMs在视频理解方面表现出色，但之前的研究已发现早期采样策略存在漏洞，而提示引导采样的安全性尚未被探索。

Method: 采用闭环优化策略，通过迭代优化通用扰动来抑制有害帧相关性分数，利用影子VideoLLM和GPT-4o-mini构建的转述有害描述集进行指导。

Result: 在三种提示引导采样策略和三个先进VideoLLMs上全面评估，攻击成功率达到82%-99%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了提示引导采样策略的安全漏洞，强调了为VideoLLMs开发更先进采样策略的重要性。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
understanding videos, supporting tasks such as summarization, captioning, and
question answering. Their performance has been driven by advances in frame
sampling, progressing from uniform-based to semantic-similarity-based and, most
recently, prompt-guided strategies. While vulnerabilities have been identified
in earlier sampling strategies, the safety of prompt-guided sampling remains
unexplored. We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box
poisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID
compromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a
closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal
perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction
set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow
VideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini. Comprehensively
evaluated on three prompt-guided sampling strategies and across three advanced
VideoLLMs, PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate, highlighting the
importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GoR是一种新颖的可学习正则化方法，通过动态损失加权自适应平衡任务特定和知识蒸馏目标，解决了QAT-KD方法在低比特量化下梯度冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的QAT-KD方法在低比特量化下难以平衡任务特定损失和蒸馏损失，由于异质梯度幅度导致性能下降。

Method: 提出Game of Regularizer (GoR)方法，仅使用两个可训练参数进行动态损失加权，减少监督信号冲突；同时引入QAT-EKD-GoR集成蒸馏框架，使用多个异构教师模型。

Result: 在图像分类、目标检测和大型语言模型压缩实验中，GoR一致优于最先进的QAT-KD方法，在低功耗边缘设备上实现更快推理同时保持全精度准确率。

Conclusion: GoR为资源受限硬件上的AI模型压缩提供了稳健解决方案，在最优条件下EKD-GoR甚至可以超越全精度模型性能。

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD)
is a promising strategy for compressing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for
deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing QAT-KD methods
often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to
heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We
propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that
adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters
for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals,
improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models
(SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large
language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster
inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce
QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple
heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR
can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for
real-world deployment.

Motivation: 评估大规模网络收集的含有标签错误的噪声训练数据能否与专家验证的小规模可信数据集竞争，以推动自动化植物识别系统的发展

Method: 使用来自不同数据源的训练集：大规模网络收集的噪声数据集和专家验证的小数据集，测试集来自Pl@ntNet移动应用收集的植物图像查询

Result: 通过挑战赛评估两种训练策略的性能表现，分析不同数据源对植物识别准确性的影响

Conclusion: 该研究为大规模植物识别系统提供了重要的数据策略评估，对利用网络资源改进植物识别技术具有指导意义

Abstract: The 2017-th edition of the LifeCLEF plant identification challenge is an
important milestone towards automated plant identification systems working at
the scale of continental floras with 10.000 plant species living mainly in
Europe and North America illustrated by a total of 1.1M images. Nowadays, such
ambitious systems are enabled thanks to the conjunction of the dazzling recent
progress in image classification with deep learning and several outstanding
international initiatives, such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), aggregating
the visual knowledge on plant species coming from the main national botany
institutes. However, despite all these efforts the majority of the plant
species still remain without pictures or are poorly illustrated. Outside the
institutional channels, a much larger number of plant pictures are available
and spread on the web through botanist blogs, plant lovers web-pages, image
hosting websites and on-line plant retailers. The LifeCLEF 2017 plant challenge
presented in this paper aimed at evaluating to what extent a large noisy
training dataset collected through the web and containing a lot of labelling
errors can compete with a smaller but trusted training dataset checked by
experts. To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was
created from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that
collects millions of plant image queries all over the world. This paper
presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge,
summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research
groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

TL;DR: 本文提出TasselNetV4模型，将植物计数从物种特定计数转向跨物种计数，结合TasselNet的局部计数思想和类无关计数的提取-匹配范式，在跨场景、跨尺度和跨物种植物计数方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 植物具有生物多样性，每年都有新品种培育，不可能为所有物种建立依赖物种的计数模型。现有类无关计数模型对非刚性结构的植物计数效果不佳，需要重新思考植物计数的问题表述。

Method: TasselNetV4基于普通视觉transformer，结合了TasselNet的局部计数思想和类无关计数的提取-匹配范式，引入了新颖的多分支框感知局部计数器来增强跨尺度鲁棒性。

Result: 在两个具有挑战性的数据集PAC-105和PAC-Somalia上进行广泛实验，TasselNetV4相比最先进的类无关计数模型不仅实现了优越的计数性能，还具有高效率。

Conclusion: TasselNetV4成为跨场景、跨尺度和跨物种植物计数的视觉基础模型，为农业应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate plant counting provides valuable information for agriculture such as
crop yield prediction, plant density assessment, and phenotype quantification.
Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art
typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant.
However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each
year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent
counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision,
we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting,
from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily
objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with
time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than
counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and
open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we
inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new
extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to
cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of
TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain
vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters
used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and
PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC
models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance
but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a
vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant
counting.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的半监督模型，通过可微分生物标志物拓扑引擎来确保视网膜OCT图像中病变和层分割的解剖学正确性，实现了层与病变之间的双向影响建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督学习方法在视网膜分割中常产生解剖学上不合理的分割结果，无法有效建模层与病变之间的相互作用，且缺乏拓扑正确性保证。

Method: 引入完全可微分的生物标志物拓扑引擎，强制执行解剖学正确的病变和层分割；采用解耦表示学习，分离空间和风格因素；利用未标记和部分标记数据集进行联合学习。

Result: 在公共和内部OCT数据集上的评估表明，该方法在病变和层分割方面均优于当前最先进方法，并能将层分割泛化到病理病例。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在半监督学习中使用解剖约束进行准确、鲁棒且可信赖的视网膜生物标志物分割的潜力。

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used for diagnosing and
monitoring retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
The segmentation of biomarkers such as layers and lesions is essential for
patient diagnosis and follow-up. Recently, semi-supervised learning has shown
promise in improving retinal segmentation performance. However, existing
methods often produce anatomically implausible segmentations, fail to
effectively model layer-lesion interactions, and lack guarantees on topological
correctness.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised model that
introduces a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce
anatomically correct segmentation of lesions and layers. This enables joint
learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions, leveraging
unlabeled and diverse partially labeled datasets. Our model learns a
disentangled representation, separating spatial and style factors. This
approach enables more realistic layer segmentations and improves lesion
segmentation, while strictly enforcing lesion location in their anatomically
plausible positions relative to the segmented layers.
  We evaluate the proposed model on public and internal datasets of OCT scans
and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both lesion and
layer segmentation, while demonstrating the ability to generalize layer
segmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated training data. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using anatomical constraints in
semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal
biomarker segmentation.

Conclusion: LifeCLEF 2016挑战赛成功推动了大规模植物识别技术，特别是在开放集识别方面的进展，为真实世界的生物多样性监测应用提供了重要参考。

Abstract: The LifeCLEF plant identification challenge aims at evaluating plant
identification methods and systems at a very large scale, close to the
conditions of a real-world biodiversity monitoring scenario. The 2016-th
edition was actually conducted on a set of more than 110K images illustrating
1000 plant species living in West Europe, built through a large-scale
participatory sensing platform initiated in 2011 and which now involves tens of
thousands of contributors. The main novelty over the previous years is that the
identification task was evaluated as an open-set recognition problem, i.e. a
problem in which the recognition system has to be robust to unknown and never
seen categories. Beyond the brute-force classification across the known classes
of the training set, the big challenge was thus to automatically reject the
false positive classification hits that are caused by the unknown classes. This
overview presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the
challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating
research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

TL;DR: SCRA-VQA是一种基于知识库的视觉问答方法，通过总结和重排图像描述来增强大语言模型的理解能力，无需昂贵的端到端训练即可在OK-VQA和A-OKVQA数据集上取得优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用大语言模型作为知识引擎，但图像描述通常包含与问题无关的噪声，且LLMs通常不理解VQA任务，限制了其推理能力。

Method: 使用预训练的视觉语言模型将图像转换为描述，生成上下文示例，同时对描述进行总结和重排以排除无关信息，增强LLMs对图像信息和问题的理解。

Result: 在6.7B参数的LLM上，SCRA-VQA在OK-VQA和A-OKVQA数据集上分别达到38.8%和34.6%的准确率。

Conclusion: SCRA-VQA通过描述重排过程有效提升了模型的推理能力和任务适应性，为知识型VQA提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual
Question Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as
knowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions
as visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the
captions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and
LLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank
Augmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to
convert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples
for the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to
exclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to
understand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the
model's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end
training. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently
on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving
accuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文揭示了感知优化与评估之间的不对称性：在图像质量评估中表现优秀的保真度指标不一定适用于感知优化，这种不匹配在对抗训练中更加明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索感知优化中保真度目标和对抗目标作为优化目标的有效性与它们作为图像质量评估指标能力之间的相关性，这一领域尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 通过系统性分析，比较不同保真度指标在感知优化中的表现，并研究判别器设计对优化效果的影响。

Result: 发现保真度指标在IQA和优化中的有效性存在不对称性；判别器设计对优化效果起决定性作用，补丁级和卷积架构比传统或基于Transformer的替代方案提供更忠实的细节重建。

Conclusion: 这些发现推进了对损失函数设计及其与IQA可迁移性联系的理解，为更原则性的感知优化方法铺平了道路。

Abstract: Perceptual optimization is primarily driven by the fidelity objective, which
enforces both semantic consistency and overall visual realism, while the
adversarial objective provides complementary refinement by enhancing perceptual
sharpness and fine-grained detail. Despite their central role, the correlation
between their effectiveness as optimization objectives and their capability as
image quality assessment (IQA) metrics remains underexplored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis and reveal an unanticipated asymmetry between
perceptual optimization and assessment: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are
not necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with this misalignment
emerging more distinctly under adversarial training. In addition, while
discriminators effectively suppress artifacts during optimization, their
learned representations offer only limited benefits when reused as backbone
initializations for IQA models. Beyond this asymmetry, our findings further
demonstrate that discriminator design plays a decisive role in shaping
optimization, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing more
faithful detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.
These insights advance the understanding of loss function design and its
connection to IQA transferability, paving the way for more principled
approaches to perceptual optimization.

Motivation: 现有VQA模型容易受到训练数据偏见的影响，过度依赖表面模式，难以泛化到多样化的问题和图像。

Method: 提出IOG-VQA模型，包含对象交互自注意力机制（捕捉图像中对象间复杂交互）和基于GAN的去偏框架（生成无偏见数据分布）。

Result: 在VQA-CP v1和VQA-CP v2数据集上的实验表明，该模型在处理偏见和不平衡数据分布方面表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 同时处理对象交互和数据集偏见对于推进VQA任务至关重要，IOG-VQA为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a unique challenge by requiring
models to understand and reason about visual content to answer questions
accurately. Existing VQA models often struggle with biases introduced by the
training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and inadequate
generalization to diverse questions and images. This paper presents a novel
model, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and
GAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention
mechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects
within an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual
context. Meanwhile, the GAN-based debiasing framework generates unbiased data
distributions, helping the model to learn more robust and generalizable
features. By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines
visual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets.
Extensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that
our model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods,
particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting
the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in
advancing VQA tasks. Our code is available at

Motivation: 视频序列常包含结构化噪声和背景伪影，传统RPCA方法的稀疏性假设难以捕捉真实视频数据的丰富变异性。

Method: 集成低秩时间建模与扩散后验采样的混合框架，通过核范数正则化和扩散模型先验进行视频分解。

Result: 在心脏超声去雾任务中，相比传统RPCA在对比度增强（gCNR）和信号保持（KS统计量）方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 结合基于模型的时间模型与深度生成先验在视频恢复中具有潜力，能够实现高保真度的视频修复。

Abstract: Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that
obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and
restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing
data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often
fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome
this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling
with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear
Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac
ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to
traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation
(KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based
temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video
restoration.

Motivation: 随着VAE、GAN和LDM等先进模型生成的合成图像越来越逼真，合成图像检测面临重大挑战。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 探索生成过程中引入的两种伪影类型：潜在分布偏差和解码诱导平滑效应。基于马尔可夫随机场的局部像素依赖特性，重建合成图像以暴露纹理连续性和边缘一致性的破坏。提出FerretNet轻量级神经网络（仅110万参数）。

Conclusion: FerretNet提供了一种高效且鲁棒的合成图像检测解决方案，证明了局部像素依赖特性在暴露合成图像伪影方面的有效性。

Abstract: The increasing realism of synthetic images generated by advanced models such
as VAEs, GANs, and LDMs poses significant challenges for synthetic image
detection. To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced
during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2)
decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local
textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies
(LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic
images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture
continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a
lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient
and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an
average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising across 22
generative models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%.

TL;DR: MoTIF是一个基于概念瓶颈模型的可解释视频分类框架，通过处理视频中的时间依赖性来识别和解释动作相关的概念模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念瓶颈模型主要针对静态图像，难以处理视频数据中的时间依赖性，而时间依赖对于理解动作和事件至关重要。

Method: 采用transformer架构设计，将概念瓶颈框架扩展到视频分类，能够处理任意长度的视频序列，识别跨时间重复出现的概念模式（motifs）。

Result: 该框架在视频数据上成功实现了概念建模范式，能够从全局概念重要性、局部概念相关性和时间依赖性三个互补角度解释视频分类结果，同时保持竞争力性能。

Conclusion: 概念瓶颈模型可以有效扩展到视频领域，为时间上下文中的概念贡献提供更好的理解，代码已在GitHub开源。

Abstract: Conceptual models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have driven
substantial progress in improving interpretability for image classification by
leveraging human-interpretable concepts. However, extending these models from
static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a
significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos,
which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we
introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural
design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework
for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the
video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes,
or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across
time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our
design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept
importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific
windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results
demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively
transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept
contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Few-shot multispectral object detection (FSMOD) addresses the challenge of
detecting objects across visible and thermal modalities with minimal annotated
data. In this paper, we explore this complex task and introduce a framework
named "FSMODNet" that leverages cross-modality feature integration to improve
detection performance even with limited labels. By effectively combining the
unique strengths of visible and thermal imagery using deformable attention, the
proposed method demonstrates robust adaptability in complex illumination and
environmental conditions. Experimental results on two public datasets show
effective object detection performance in challenging low-data regimes,
outperforming several baselines we established from state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用粒子滤波器解决基于相机测量的3D物体定位问题，特别适用于无人机野火监测等安全关键任务，在远距离物体或计算资源受限的场景下，该方法比密集深度估计或3D场景重建更可行。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无人机野火监测等安全关键任务中，需要对检测到的物体进行3D定位。传统的密集深度估计或3D场景重建方法在远距离物体或计算资源受限的情况下不可行，因此需要一种更有效的解决方案。

Method: 使用粒子滤波器进行单目标和多目标场景的3D定位，结合GNSS相机姿态估计和图像分割序列。方法独立于检测方法，具有灵活性。

Result: 通过3D模拟和基于无人机的图像分割序列实验验证，粒子滤波器能够在其他方法失败的情况下有效解决基于相机姿态和图像分割的实际定位任务。

Conclusion: 粒子滤波器是解决基于相机测量的3D物体定位问题的有效方法，特别适用于无人机野火监测等应用场景，且可以与现有图像分割模型结合使用。

Abstract: 3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is
essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire
monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be
solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the
context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available
computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show
that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple
target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a
drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system
(GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter
can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and
image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle
filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new
tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be
conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image
segmentation model.

TL;DR: 提出SwinMamba框架，结合局部Mamba扫描和全局感受野，用于遥感图像语义分割，在LoveDA和ISPRS Potsdam数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像语义分割面临高空间分辨率、复杂场景结构和多样物体尺度的挑战。Vision Mamba虽然具有全局感受野和低计算复杂度，但依赖全局扫描会忽略关键的局部特征（如纹理和边缘）。

Method: SwinMamba受Swin Transformer启发，在前两个阶段执行局部扫描捕获细粒度细节，后两个阶段利用全局扫描融合更广泛的上下文信息。使用重叠的移位窗口增强区域间信息交换。

Result: 在LoveDA和ISPRS Potsdam数据集上的大量实验表明，SwinMamba优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: SwinMamba通过结合局部和全局特征感知，为遥感图像语义分割提供了有效的解决方案，显示出其优越性和潜力。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in
computer vision, supporting a wide range of applications such as land use
classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this
task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene
structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To
address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been
proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the
recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive
field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and
effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning
tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which
are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts.
To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by
the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning
within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's
perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two
stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details,
while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader
contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows
enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature
integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and
ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution
for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于打包的多实例学习框架，用于解决计算病理学中全切片图像序列长度极端变化、数据异质性和监督有限的问题，通过打包采样、残差分支和注意力下采样器实现高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中的全切片图像具有极长的序列长度（可达20万）、显著的长度变化和有限的监督，导致数据异质性和冗余问题，传统方法在有限监督下难以有效处理这些挑战。

Method: 提出打包MIL框架：将采样的变长特征序列打包为固定长度序列以支持批处理训练；引入残差分支将丢弃特征组合成超切片进行多切片监督；使用注意力驱动下采样器压缩特征减少冗余。

Result: 在PANDA(UNI)数据集上实现了高达8%的准确率提升，同时仅使用12%的训练时间，显著提高了训练效率和性能。

Conclusion: 专注于解决计算病理学中的数据挑战在基础模型时代具有重要潜力，所提方法有效缓解了序列长度变化、数据异质性和监督有限等问题。

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide
images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths
(up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited
supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data
heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training
efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited
supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a
pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature
sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving
data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes
discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with
tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature
loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to
compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these
challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while
using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential
in the era of foundation models. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimDiff是一种模拟器约束扩散模型，通过将环境参数直接集成到去噪过程中，无需在推理时调用模拟器即可高效生成物理合理的人体运动，并实现对不同物理系数的细粒度控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将基于模拟器的运动投影层整合到扩散过程中以确保物理合理性，但由于模拟器的顺序性质，这些方法计算成本高且无法并行化。

Method: 将模拟器运动投影解释为扩散过程中的一种引导形式，提出SimDiff模型，通过将环境参数（如重力、风力）直接条件化到去噪过程中，避免推理时重复调用模拟器。

Result: SimDiff能够高效生成物理合理的运动，提供对物理系数的细粒度控制，并在未见过的环境参数组合上表现出组合泛化能力。

Conclusion: SimDiff通过将物理约束直接集成到扩散模型中，实现了高效且可控的物理合理运动生成，解决了传统模拟器方法的计算效率问题。

Abstract: Generating physically plausible human motion is crucial for applications such
as character animation and virtual reality. Existing approaches often
incorporate a simulator-based motion projection layer to the diffusion process
to enforce physical plausibility. However, such methods are computationally
expensive due to the sequential nature of the simulator, which prevents
parallelization. We show that simulator-based motion projection can be
interpreted as a form of guidance, either classifier-based or classifier-free,
within the diffusion process. Building on this insight, we propose SimDiff, a
Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that integrates environment parameters
(e.g., gravity, wind) directly into the denoising process. By conditioning on
these parameters, SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently,
without repeated simulator calls at inference, and also provides fine-grained
control over different physical coefficients. Moreover, SimDiff successfully
generalizes to unseen combinations of environmental parameters, demonstrating
compositional generalization.

Motivation: 研究视觉模型对高斯噪声的鲁棒性，分析不同架构设计选择的影响，将经验观察转化为可操作的设计规则。

Method: 对1174个预训练视觉模型进行广泛评估，识别鲁棒性设计模式，并通过理论分析（包括低通滤波器理论、池化操作分析和Lipschitz边界）解释观察到的相关性。

Result: 发现四个提高高斯噪声鲁棒性的设计模式：更大的stem核、更小的输入分辨率、平均池化、监督ViT而非CLIP ViT，这些改进可达506个排名提升和21.6%的准确率增益。

Conclusion: 研究将鲁棒性分解为可解释的模块，提供了理论解释，并为设计更鲁棒的视觉模型提供了即插即用的实用指南。

Abstract: While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on
specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why
certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian
noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design
rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained
vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for
improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input
resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather
than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy
gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,
converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that
low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically
with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy
roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we
demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion
to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that
grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error
and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the
vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller
normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case
sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing
common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into
interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and
build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more
robust against Gaussian noise.

Abstract: Scene graphs (SGs) provide structured relational representations crucial for
decoding complex, dynamic surgical environments. This PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping
review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery,
charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions.
Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide':
internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses
real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on
simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically,
the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized
foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large
vision-language models in surgical contexts. This progress has established SGs
as a cornerstone technology for both analysis, such as workflow recognition and
automated safety monitoring, and generative tasks like controllable surgical
simulation. Although challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation
persist, they are actively being addressed through emerging techniques.
Surgical SGs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge, enabling a new

Abstract: We present an automated vision-based system for defect detection and
classification of laser power meter sensor coatings. Our approach addresses the
critical challenge of identifying coating defects such as thermal damage and
scratches that can compromise laser energy measurement accuracy in medical and
industrial applications. The system employs an unsupervised anomaly detection
framework that trains exclusively on ``good'' sensor images to learn normal
coating distribution patterns, enabling detection of both known and novel
defect types without requiring extensive labeled defect datasets. Our
methodology consists of three key components: (1) a robust preprocessing
pipeline using Laplacian edge detection and K-means clustering to segment the
area of interest, (2) synthetic data augmentation via StyleGAN2, and (3) a
UFlow-based neural network architecture for multi-scale feature extraction and
anomaly map generation. Experimental evaluation on 366 real sensor images
demonstrates $93.8\%$ accuracy on defective samples and $89.3\%$ accuracy on
good samples, with image-level AUROC of 0.957 and pixel-level AUROC of 0.961.

Abstract: The dynamic propagation of social media has broadened the reach of financial
advisory content through podcast videos, yet extracting insights from lengthy,
multimodal segments (30-40 minutes) remains challenging. We introduce FASTER
(Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a
modular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting
modality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3)
aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP
for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based
transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific
fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against
the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns
keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal
coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a
dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos
for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm
FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By establishing

TL;DR: ASD是一种适配器，能够在无需任何预训练或先决条件的情况下，让自监督学习（SSL）方法直接用于深度图像聚类任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SSL与深度聚类结合的方法都需要预训练、聚类学习或训练好的聚类模型作为前提条件，限制了SSL学习器在图像聚类任务中的灵活应用。

Method: 1）从无标签数据中随机采样伪标签数据；2）设置实例级分类器学习语义对齐的实例级标签；3）通过跟踪预测的类别转换提取实例级类别的高层相似性；4）为伪标签数据分配聚类级标签；5）使用带聚类级标签的伪标签数据触发通用SSL学习器进行图像聚类。

Result: ASD在多个基准测试中优于最新的深度图像聚类方法，与使用真实标签的SSL方法相比准确率差距很小（如CIFAR-10上仅差1.33%），并能进一步提升现有SSL嵌入的深度图像聚类方法性能。

Conclusion: ASD实现了SSL学习器在深度图像聚类任务中的冷启动，无需任何先决条件，具有优异的性能和通用性。

Abstract: Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks
to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining,
clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting
the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering
task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL
learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we
first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an
instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned
instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we
track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract
high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to
assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the
pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL
learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the
superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep
image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL
methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can
also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image
clustering methods.

TL;DR: 提出SiNGER框架，通过奇异零空间引导的能量重分配来抑制Vision Transformer中的高范数伪影，同时保留信息信号，从而改进知识蒸馏效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformer在作为视觉基础模型时会产生高范数伪影，这些伪影在知识蒸馏过程中会主导目标函数，导致学生模型过度拟合伪影而忽略信息信号

Method: 使用基于LoRA的适配器实现零空间引导的扰动，在教师特征精炼过程中抑制伪影同时保留信息，然后将精炼后的特征蒸馏给学生模型

Result: 在多个下游任务中实现了最先进的性能，生成了更清晰和可解释的表征

Conclusion: SiNGER框架能够有效解决教师模型中伪影问题，提升知识蒸馏的效果

Abstract: Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation
models, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade
representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to
students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to
artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from
larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an
inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative
signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided
Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses
artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled
teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided
perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the
refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this
perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal
structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently
improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple
downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.

handling. It accepts arbitrary combinations of spectral bands and their
wavelengths, producing fixed-size feature maps that feed into a compact,
quantized segmentation model based on a modified U-Net. The module runs
efficiently on embedded CPUs using Apache TVM, while the segmentation model is
deployed on FPGA, forming a CPU-FPGA hybrid pipeline suitable for
space-qualified hardware. Evaluations on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 datasets
demonstrate accurate segmentation across diverse input configurations.

Abstract: Text-to-image models exhibit remarkable capabilities in image generation.
However, they also pose safety risks of generating harmful content. A key
challenge of existing concept erasure methods is the precise removal of target
concepts while minimizing degradation of image quality. In this paper, we
propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can
precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single
neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text
embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons
align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons
responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification
method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By
suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves
surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality.
Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves
state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the
model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our
method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly
outperforming existing methods.

*Andreas Gilson,Lukas Meyer,Oliver Scholz,Ute Schmid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出KDSS算法用于生物点云的下采样，避免传统方法需要降采样输入数据的问题，实现全分辨率点云分割，适用于不同传感器和植物物种。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有植物器官点云分割方法通常针对特定植物物种或传感器，且需要大量预处理和降采样来满足硬件或神经网络输入要求，限制了应用范围。

Method: 开发KDSS（K-Dimensional Sub-Sampling）算法，这是一种轻量级的下采样方法，能够保留分辨率，无需对输入数据进行降采样。

Result: 将KDSS与当前最先进的分割模型结合，在摄影测量、激光三角测量和LiDAR等不同模态的各种植物物种上取得了令人满意的结果。

Conclusion: KDSS作为轻量级分辨率保持替代方案，可用于植物器官分割，不受物种和传感器模态限制。

Abstract: Accurate point cloud segmentation for plant organs is crucial for 3D plant
phenotyping. Existing solutions are designed problem-specific with a focus on
certain plant species or specified sensor-modalities for data acquisition.
Furthermore, it is common to use extensive pre-processing and down-sample the
plant point clouds to meet hardware or neural network input size requirements.
We propose a simple, yet effective algorithm KDSS for sub-sampling of
biological point clouds that is agnostic to sensor data and plant species. The
main benefit of this approach is that we do not need to down-sample our input
data and thus, enable segmentation of the full-resolution point cloud.
Combining KD-SS with current state-of-the-art segmentation models shows
satisfying results evaluated on different modalities such as photogrammetry,
laser triangulation and LiDAR for various plant species. We propose KD-SS as
lightweight resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and
down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation regardless of used species
and sensor modality.

TL;DR: 提出了名为Mambo的新FG-BG分解框架，用于解决少样本分布外检测中现有方法对局部类别相似性过度依赖和固定背景补丁提取策略的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因过度依赖局部类别相似性和固定背景补丁提取策略而导致鲁棒性不足。

Method: 首先学习背景提示以获得包含背景和图像语义信息的局部背景相似性，然后使用局部类别相似性对其进行细化。提出补丁自校准调优来灵活选择不同样本的背景补丁数量。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，Mambo在OOD检测和近OOD检测设置方面达到了最佳性能。

Conclusion: Mambo框架通过结合局部背景相似性和局部类别相似性，以及灵活的补丁选择策略，显著提升了FS-OOD检测的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Existing foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods for the few-shot
out-of-distribution (FS-OOD) detection often suffer from low robustness due to
over-reliance on the local class similarity and a fixed background patch
extraction strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a new FG-BG
decomposition framework, namely Mambo, for FS-OOD detection. Specifically, we
propose to first learn a background prompt to obtain the local background
similarity containing both the background and image semantic information, and
then refine the local background similarity using the local class similarity.
As a result, we use both the refined local background similarity and the local
class similarity to conduct background extraction, reducing the dependence of
the local class similarity in previous methods. Furthermore, we propose the
patch self-calibrated tuning to consider the sample diversity to flexibly
select numbers of background patches for different samples, and thus exploring
the issue of fixed background extraction strategies in previous methods.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed
Mambo achieves the best performance, compared to SOTA methods in terms of OOD
detection and near OOD detection setting. The source code will be released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种图像分割数据集划分方法：迭代像素分层（IPS）和Wasserstein驱动的进化分层（WDES），旨在解决随机划分导致的测试集不具代表性和模型评估偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分割中随机划分数据集会导致测试集不具代表性，造成评估偏差和模型泛化能力差。虽然分层采样在分类任务中有效，但由于分割任务的多标签结构和类别不平衡特性，将其扩展到分割任务具有挑战性。

Method: 1. 迭代像素分层（IPS）：基于现有分层概念的简单标签感知采样方法；2. Wasserstein驱动的进化分层（WDES）：新颖的遗传算法，通过最小化Wasserstein距离来优化数据集划分间的标签分布相似性，理论上证明在足够代数下具有全局最优性。

Result: 使用新提出的统计异质性指标评估，WDES始终产生更具代表性的划分。在街景、医学影像和卫星图像等多种分割任务中应用WDES，结果显示性能方差降低且模型评估得到改善。WDES在处理小型、不平衡和低多样性数据集时尤其有价值。

Conclusion: WDES方法能够有效解决图像分割数据集划分中的偏差问题，特别是在处理具有挑战性的数据集时表现出色，为分割模型的可靠评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Random splitting of datasets in image segmentation often leads to
unrepresentative test sets, resulting in biased evaluations and poor model
generalization. While stratified sampling has proven effective for addressing
label distribution imbalance in classification tasks, extending these ideas to
segmentation remains challenging due to the multi-label structure and class
imbalance typically present in such data. Building on existing stratification
concepts, we introduce Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS), a straightforward,
label-aware sampling method tailored for segmentation tasks. Additionally, we
present Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), a novel genetic
algorithm designed to minimize the Wasserstein distance, thereby optimizing the
similarity of label distributions across dataset splits. We prove that WDES is
globally optimal given enough generations. Using newly proposed statistical
heterogeneity metrics, we evaluate both methods against random sampling and
find that WDES consistently produces more representative splits. Applying WDES
across diverse segmentation tasks, including street scenes, medical imaging,
and satellite imagery, leads to lower performance variance and improved model
evaluation. Our results also highlight the particular value of WDES in handling
small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets, where conventional splitting
strategies are most prone to bias.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EnGraf-Net是一种利用语义关联层次结构（分类法）作为监督信号的端到端深度神经网络模型，用于细粒度分类，无需裁剪技术或手动标注即可达到与最先进方法竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的细粒度分类模型大多依赖部件标注或复杂技术来自动提取注意力图，但这些方法存在局部特征表示不完整的问题。人类识别物体时还会形成语义关联，因此本文利用语义关联层次结构作为监督信号。

Method: 提出EnGraf-Net模型，将语义关联结构化为层次结构（分类法），并将其作为端到端深度神经网络中的监督信号。模型在三个知名数据集（CIFAR-100、CUB-200-2011、FGVC-Aircraft）上进行广泛实验。

Result: EnGraf-Net在三个数据集上表现出优于许多现有细粒度模型的性能，与最先进的近期方法具有竞争力，且不需要裁剪技术或手动标注。

Conclusion: 利用语义关联层次结构作为监督信号可以有效提升细粒度分类性能，证明了该方法在不依赖裁剪技术或手动标注的情况下具有竞争优势。

Abstract: Fine-grained classification models are designed to focus on the relevant
details necessary to distinguish highly similar classes, particularly when
intra-class variance is high and inter-class variance is low. Most existing
models rely on part annotations such as bounding boxes, part locations, or
textual attributes to enhance classification performance, while others employ
sophisticated techniques to automatically extract attention maps. We posit that
part-based approaches, including automatic cropping methods, suffer from an
incomplete representation of local features, which are fundamental for
distinguishing similar objects. While fine-grained classification aims to
recognize the leaves of a hierarchical structure, humans recognize objects by
also forming semantic associations. In this paper, we leverage semantic
associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals within
an end-to-end deep neural network model, termed EnGraf-Net. Extensive
experiments on three well-known datasets CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and
FGVC-Aircraft demonstrate the superiority of EnGraf-Net over many existing
fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with the most recent
state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring cropping techniques or manual
annotations.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了视觉变换器(ViTs)对对抗性补丁攻击的脆弱性，验证了从卷积神经网络(CNNs)到ViTs的对抗攻击技术可迁移性，发现不同ViT模型对攻击的抵抗力存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统的广泛应用，其安全性变得至关重要。尽管ViTs在性能和对抗扰动鲁棒性方面优于CNNs，但它们仍然容易受到对抗性补丁攻击，这可能导致安全漏洞或错误分类。

Method: 使用Creases Transformation(CT)技术设计现实的对抗性补丁，在人物与非人物分类任务中测试四个微调的ViT模型，评估攻击成功率和模型脆弱性变化。

Result: 实验结果显示攻击成功率从40.04%(google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k)到99.97%(facebook/dino-vitb16)不等，证实了对抗性补丁从CNNs到ViTs的跨架构可迁移性。

Conclusion: 预训练数据集规模和方法论强烈影响模型对对抗攻击的抵抗力，ViTs虽然在某些方面优于CNNs，但仍存在显著的安全漏洞。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning systems has made their security a
critical concern. Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the
decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches
or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained
significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance
compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against
adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,
particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI
classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing
realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.
non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)
technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring
naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of
adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification
models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary
person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack
success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97%
(facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and
facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the
cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs,
with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model
resilience to adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: UniTransfer提出了一种新颖的架构，通过空间和时间步分解实现精确可控的视频概念迁移，在视频编辑领域取得了优于现有基线方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频概念迁移方法缺乏对视频不同组件的细粒度控制能力，难以实现精确可控的视频编辑效果。

Method: 采用空间分解（前景主体、背景、运动流）和扩散时间步分解的双重分解策略，结合双流到单流的DiT架构和Chain-of-Prompt机制，利用LLM进行渐进式生成指导。

Result: 在OpenAnimal数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在视觉保真度和可编辑性方面均优于现有基线，能够实现高质量的视频概念迁移。

Conclusion: UniTransfer通过创新的分解架构和渐进式生成策略，为视频概念迁移任务提供了有效的解决方案，具有重要的研究价值和实际应用前景。

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial
and diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving
precise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of
spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the
foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this
decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based
architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in
the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on
random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning
paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a
Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We
decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and
leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide
the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset
called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in
video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse
reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual
fidelity and editability. Web Page:

TL;DR: 本文提出视觉测试时缩放（VTTS）方法，通过迭代感知增强多模态大语言模型的推理能力，在推理过程中逐步优化视觉关注区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖LLM推理来分析解析后的视觉信息，但受限于静态感知阶段，无法实现类似人类的分层注意力机制。

Method: VTTS采用迭代感知机制，结合强化学习和时空监督来优化推理过程，通过逐步聚焦高置信度的时空区域来模仿人类的分层注意力。

Result: 实验表明VTTS在超过15个基准测试中平均提升超过5%，Videochat-R1.5模型在视频对话、视频推理和时空感知任务上表现显著优于Qwen2.5VL-3B和-7B等基线模型。

Conclusion: VTTS通过增加感知计算有效提升了MLLMs的性能，验证了迭代感知在增强多模态推理能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: Inducing reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is critical
for achieving human-level perception and understanding. Existing methods mainly
leverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static
perception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a
novel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during
inference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining
focus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual
predictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP)
mechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal
supervision to optimize reasoning. To support this paradigm, we also present
VTTS-80K, a dataset tailored for iterative perception. These designs allows a
MLLM to enhance its performance by increasing its perceptual compute. Extensive
experiments validate VTTS's effectiveness and generalization across diverse
tasks and benchmarks. Our newly introduced Videochat-R1.5 model has achieved
remarkable improvements, with an average increase of over 5\%, compared to
robust baselines such as Qwen2.5VL-3B and -7B, across more than 15 benchmarks
that encompass video conversation, video reasoning, and spatio-temporal
perception.

TL;DR: Mammo-CLIP Dissect是首个基于概念的可解释性框架，用于系统分析乳腺X光摄影DL视觉模型，通过乳腺摄影专用视觉语言模型为神经元标注可解释的文本概念，并量化其与领域知识的对齐程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解DL模型学习内容对于临床AI安全部署至关重要。以往研究主要关注基于像素的可解释性方法，而较少关注模型学习的文本概念，这些概念可能更好地反映临床医生的推理过程。

Method: 利用乳腺摄影专用视觉语言模型（Mammo-CLIP）作为"解剖器"，在指定层为神经元标注人类可解释的文本概念，并量化其与领域知识的对齐程度。研究比较了不同训练数据和微调策略下的概念学习差异。

Result: 乳腺摄影数据训练的模型捕获更多临床相关概念，与放射科医生工作流程更一致。任务特定微调增强了某些概念类别（如良性钙化）的捕获，但可能减少其他类别（如密度相关特征）的覆盖，表明专业化与泛化之间存在权衡。

Conclusion: Mammo-CLIP Dissect提供了关于卷积神经网络如何捕获乳腺摄影特定知识的见解，揭示了领域特定训练和任务特定适应如何塑造概念学习。

Abstract: Understanding what deep learning (DL) models learn is essential for the safe
deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings. While previous
work has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been
paid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect
the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first
concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision
models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific
vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a "dissector," our approach labels
neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and
quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we
investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL
vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific
datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept
specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain
underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more
clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists'
workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for
task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories
(e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g.,
density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and
generalisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights
into how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific
knowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we
reveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept
learning. Code and concept set are available:

<details>

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在视频推理中存在过程不一致问题，即中间推理过程与视频动态偏离，即使最终答案正确也会影响可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出基于DTW的过程奖励机制，将推理轨迹与时间基础参考对齐，无需辅助奖励模型即可实现高效过程监督。同时构建MOSS-Video基准测试集用于训练和评估。

Result: MOSS-ChatV在MOSS-Video测试集上达到87.2%的准确率，在MVBench和MMVU等通用视频基准上也有提升，且在不同架构（Qwen2.5-VL、Phi-2）上均表现一致。

Conclusion: 该框架能产生更一致稳定的推理轨迹，具有广泛的适用性，为视频推理提供了有效的过程监督解决方案。

Abstract: Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception
toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet
existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate
reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct,
undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we
introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning
traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process
supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state
prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a
benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to
fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation.
MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on
general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently
yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2,
confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further
show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

Method: 将相机和物体运动转换为像素运动，使用稳定扩散网络学习参考运动图，结合语义对象先验输入图像到视频网络生成视频。

Result: 大量实验验证该方法大幅优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效生成符合指定相机轨迹的视频，同时保持物体运动的一致性。

Abstract: Generating videos guided by camera trajectories poses significant challenges
in achieving consistency and generalizability, particularly when both camera
and object motions are present. Existing approaches often attempt to learn
these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative
motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by
converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable
diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to
the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic
object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the
desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while
maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our
model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像生成AI的快速发展，合成图像与真实图像的界限变得模糊，生成器与判别器之间的竞争日益激烈。本文旨在探究判别器在何种条件下处于最不利地位。

Method: 通过分析数据维度和数据复杂度两个关键因素，使用Kolmogorov复杂度作为数据集内在结构的度量，研究不同复杂度条件下合成图像的可检测性。

Result: 研究发现：增加维度通常能增强判别器检测细微不一致的能力；简单数据集几乎可以被生成器完美学习；高度多样化的数据集会掩盖生成器的缺陷；中等复杂度数据集最有利于检测，因为生成器无法完全捕捉分布且错误仍然可见。

Conclusion: 数据复杂度对合成图像检测有重要影响，简单和高度复杂的数据集会削弱判别器的优势，而中等复杂度数据集为检测提供了最有利的条件。

Abstract: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between
synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and
discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which
discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key
factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased
dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle
inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov
complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very
simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic
images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme
diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets
create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully
capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

Motivation: 为了解决传统CLIP模型在不同分辨率下需要重新训练的问题，实现单一模型支持多分辨率推理，并通过自适应计算来平衡精度和计算成本。

Method: 使用多级小波分解替代标准补丁嵌入，采用键值缓存和因果跨层注意力机制，结合基于置信度的门控机制实现自适应早期退出。

Result: 在零样本分类任务中表现优异，仅需轻量级蒸馏训练，就能在保持竞争力的准确率同时显著节省计算资源。

Conclusion: WAVECLIP提供了一种高效的自适应分辨率推理方案，用户可以通过单一部署模型动态选择计算精度权衡，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution
inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces
standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling
the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple
resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low
resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and
causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to
the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot
classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism
enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a
compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires
only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves
competitive accuracy with significant computational savings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注CLIP模型的零样本泛化能力，但忽视了量化对模型可靠性的影响。量化作为模型部署的关键技术，其对CLIP模型在准确度之外的可靠性指标的影响尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 采用大规模评估方法，系统分析量化对CLIP模型的影响，不仅评估分布内精度，还包括全面的可靠性指标评估。特别研究了量化感知训练(QAT)方法的效果。

Result: 量化能持续改善通常欠自信的预训练模型的校准度，但会降低过自信变体的校准度。有趣的是，校准度下降并不妨碍OOD检测性能的提升。研究发现特定QAT方法能在零样本精度、校准度和OOD鲁棒性上实现同步增益。

the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still
overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance
beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale
evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution
accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing
counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that
quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident
pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants.
Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other
reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these
same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific
quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in
zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a
strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights
for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable,
and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

*Iñigo Alonso,Imanol Miranda,Eneko Agirre,Mirella Lapata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TABLET是一个大规模视觉表格理解数据集，包含400万示例和200万独特表格，88%保留原始可视化，旨在解决现有基准缺乏真实世界表格复杂性和视觉多样性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前表格理解基准主要使用合成渲染，缺乏真实世界表格的复杂性和视觉多样性，且现有VTU数据集提供固定示例和预定义指令，无法访问底层序列化数据进行重构。

Method: 构建TABLET数据集，包含400万示例覆盖20个任务，基于200万独特表格，每个示例包含配对的图像-HTML表示、全面元数据和溯源信息。使用Qwen2.5-VL-7B等视觉语言模型在TABLET上进行微调。

Result: 在TABLET上微调的模型在已见和未见VTU任务上表现更好，对真实世界表格可视化的鲁棒性增强。

Conclusion: 通过保留原始可视化并在统一大规模集合中维护示例可追溯性，TABLET为未来VTU模型的鲁棒训练和可扩展评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: While table understanding increasingly relies on pixel-only settings where
tables are processed as visual representations, current benchmarks
predominantly use synthetic renderings that lack the complexity and visual
diversity of real-world tables. Additionally, existing visual table
understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations
and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data
for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4
million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88%
preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML
representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking
back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like
Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while
increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving
original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified
large-scale collection, TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and
extensible evaluation of future VTU models.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于共形预测的新方法，用于控制图像预测解释的保真度，通过识别能够保持模型预测的关键特征子集，无需真实解释进行校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的特征归因方法在鲁棒性和忠实反映黑盒模型推理方面存在局限性，需要一种能够直接控制解释保真度的方法。

Method: 提出四种一致性函数来量化解释与模型预测的符合程度，使用共形预测框架识别能够保持模型预测的最小特征子集。

Result: 在6个图像数据集和5种解释器上的实验表明，FastSHAP在保真度和信息效率方面优于竞争方法，基于超像素的一致性度量比像素级更有效。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需真实解释校准的可控解释保真度框架，为可靠的特征归因解释提供了新途径。

Abstract: Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based
predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively
visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may
fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based
approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated
explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is
sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information
carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth
explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to
quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions.
The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image
datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently
outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational
efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions.
Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels
are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.

*Muxin Pu,Mei Kuan Lim,Chun Yong Chong,Chen Change Loy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sigma是一个基于骨架的手语理解统一框架，通过多模态融合和分层对齐学习解决了当前方法的三个关键限制，在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手语理解方法存在三个关键问题：语义基础薄弱、局部细节与全局上下文不平衡、跨模态学习效率低。骨架数据虽然能鲁棒处理主体和背景变化，但难以捕捉语言意义。

Method: 提出Sigma框架，包含：1）手语感知的早期融合机制，促进视觉和文本模态的深度交互；2）分层对齐学习策略，最大化不同模态特征在不同层次上的一致性；3）结合对比学习、文本匹配和语言建模的统一预训练框架。

Result: 在孤立手语识别、连续手语识别和无注释手语翻译等多个基准测试中取得了新的最先进结果，涵盖不同手语和口语。

Conclusion: Sigma证明了语义信息丰富的预训练的重要性，以及骨架数据作为手语理解独立解决方案的有效性。

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective for learning transferable features in sign
language understanding (SLU) tasks. Recently, skeleton-based methods have
gained increasing attention because they can robustly handle variations in
subjects and backgrounds without being affected by appearance or environmental
factors. Current SLU methods continue to face three key limitations: 1) weak
semantic grounding, as models often capture low-level motion patterns from
skeletal data but struggle to relate them to linguistic meaning; 2) imbalance
between local details and global context, with models either focusing too
narrowly on fine-grained cues or overlooking them for broader context; and 3)
inefficient cross-modal learning, as constructing semantically aligned
representations across modalities remains difficult. To address these, we
propose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a
sign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between
visual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic
context; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises
agreements across different levels of paired features from different
modalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level
semantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines
contrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic
consistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on
isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and
gloss-free sign language translation on multiple benchmarks spanning different
sign and spoken languages, demonstrating the impact of semantically informative
pre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution
for SLU.

TL;DR: 本文对文本-图像生成评估中广泛使用的指标进行了全面研究，发现没有单一指标在所有任务中表现一致，指标性能随组合问题类型变化。VQA指标并非普遍优越，某些嵌入指标在特定情况下更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本-图像生成技术快速发展，但评估生成结果是否真正捕捉提示中的对象、属性和关系仍是核心挑战。当前评估严重依赖自动化指标，但这些指标往往基于惯例或流行度采用，而非经过人类判断验证。

Method: 对广泛使用的组合文本-图像评估指标进行广泛研究，分析其在不同组合挑战中的行为，比较不同指标家族与人类判断的一致性，超越了简单的相关性分析。

Result: 结果显示没有单一指标在所有任务中表现一致：性能随组合问题类型变化。VQA指标虽然流行但并非普遍优越，某些嵌入指标在特定情况下更强。仅基于图像的指标对组合评估贡献很小。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了在可信评估和作为生成奖励模型使用时，需要谨慎和透明地选择指标。

Abstract: Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs
truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts
remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on
automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity
rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported
progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to
understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present
a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation.
Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across
diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families
align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs
consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional
problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly
superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific
cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional
evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment.
These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric
selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models
in generation. Project page is available at

TL;DR: 提出SlideMamba框架，结合Mamba架构和图神经网络(GNNs)进行全切片图像分析，通过熵基自适应融合策略平衡局部和全局信息，在基因融合和突变状态预测任务中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学需要从全切片图像中提取有意义的表示来支持临床和生物学任务，现有方法在捕捉局部空间关系和长距离上下文依赖方面存在局限

Method: 集成Mamba架构(擅长长距离全局依赖)和GNNs(擅长细粒度短程空间交互)，采用熵基置信度加权机制的自适应融合策略动态平衡两个分支的贡献

Result: SlideMamba在PRAUC上达到0.751±0.05，显著优于MIL(0.491)、Trans-MIL(0.39)、Mamba-only(0.664)、GNN-only(0.748)和GAT-Mamba(0.703)，在ROC AUC、敏感性和特异性方面也表现优异

Conclusion: 集成架构结合熵基自适应融合策略展现出强大性能，为计算病理学中的空间分辨预测建模任务提供了有前景的应用潜力

Abstract: Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting
meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various
clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep
learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture
both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies,
offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules
excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize
fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these
complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an
entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically
balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the
branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the
contextual importance of local versus global information for different
downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a
representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our
framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve
(PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39
\pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a
prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves
competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm
0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength
of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive
fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of
spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

TL;DR: Hunyuan3D-Omni是一个统一的多模态可控3D资产生成框架，支持图像、点云、体素、边界框和骨骼姿态等多种控制信号，实现精细的几何、拓扑和姿态控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D生成模型主要依赖图像或文本条件，缺乏细粒度的跨模态控制，限制了可控性和实际应用。

Method: 基于Hunyuan3D 2.1构建统一跨模态架构，采用渐进式难度感知采样策略，对每个样本选择一种控制模态，偏重难信号（如骨骼姿态）而降低易信号（如点云）权重。

Result: 实验表明额外控制信号提高了生成精度，支持几何感知变换，并增强了生产工作流的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Hunyuan3D-Omni通过多模态控制实现了更精确可控的3D资产生成，为实际生产应用提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D-native generative models have accelerated asset
creation for games, film, and design. However, most methods still rely
primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal
controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this
gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained,
controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images,
Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose
priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry,
topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model
unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a
progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control
modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal
pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust
multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show
that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable
geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production
workflows.

Motivation: CNN经常利用表面相关性进行"作弊"预测，现有方法依赖人工标注的注意力监督，限制了可扩展性。

Method: 使用视觉语言模型通过自然语言提示自动生成语义注意力图，引入辅助损失函数使CNN注意力与语言引导的注意力图对齐。

Result: 在ColoredMNIST和DecoyMNIST数据集上达到最先进性能，表现出更好的泛化能力和减少的捷径依赖。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需人工标注的可扩展框架，能够促进更可靠和符合认知的决策过程。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) frequently "cheat" by exploiting
superficial correlations, raising concerns about whether they make predictions
for the right reasons. Inspired by cognitive science, which highlights the role
of attention in robust human perception, recent methods have sought to guide
model attention using concept-based supervision and explanation regularization.
However, these techniques depend on labor-intensive, expert-provided
annotations, limiting their scalability. We propose a scalable framework that
leverages vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention
maps using natural language prompts. By introducing an auxiliary loss that
aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps, our approach promotes
more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making without manual
annotation. Experiments on challenging datasets, ColoredMNIST and DecoyMNIST,
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and
remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST,
demonstrating improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and model
attention that better reflects human intuition.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical medical imaging modality in
clinical diagnosis and research, yet its complexity and heterogeneity pose
challenges for automated analysis, particularly in scalable and generalizable
machine learning applications. While foundation models have revolutionized
natural language and vision tasks, their application to MRI remains limited due
to data scarcity and narrow anatomical focus. In this work, we present
Decipher-MR, a 3D MRI-specific vision-language foundation model trained on a
large-scale dataset comprising 200,000 MRI series from over 22,000 studies
spanning diverse anatomical regions, sequences, and pathologies. Decipher-MR
integrates self-supervised vision learning with report-guided text supervision
to build robust, generalizable representations, enabling effective adaptation
across broad applications. To enable robust and diverse clinical tasks with
minimal computational overhead, Decipher-MR supports a modular design that
enables tuning of lightweight, task-specific decoders attached to a frozen
pretrained encoder. Following this setting, we evaluate Decipher-MR across
diverse benchmarks including disease classification, demographic prediction,
anatomical localization, and cross-modal retrieval, demonstrating consistent

Abstract: The field of vision-language understanding has been actively researched in
recent years, thanks to the development of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even
for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by
iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are
disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not
available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal
mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs.
To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP,
which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative
sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists
of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture.
Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer
the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question
considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that
the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as
additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate
reasoning than the previous works.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型评估主要关注对齐性，即检查提示中指定的元素是否出现，但忽视了模型在提示之外生成的内容。语言和视觉语言模型中的幻觉现象尚未在文本到图像领域得到清晰界定。

Method: 通过分析文本到图像生成模型的输出，提出了幻觉的三类分类法：属性幻觉（模型添加了提示中未指定的属性）、关系幻觉（模型错误地表示对象间的关系）和对象幻觉（模型添加了提示中未指定的对象）。

Result: 该框架为文本到图像模型的评估设定了上限，并揭示了隐藏的偏见，为更丰富的模型评估提供了基础。

Conclusion: 明确定义文本到图像模型中的幻觉现象对于全面评估模型性能至关重要，提出的分类体系有助于识别和量化模型偏见驱动的生成偏差。

Abstract: In language and vision-language models, hallucination is broadly understood
as content generated from a model's prior knowledge or biases rather than from
the given input. While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it
has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing
evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified
elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We
argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a
taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.
This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden
biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微动作识别方法在真实场景中表现不佳，因为个体间差异导致相同动作表现不同，阻碍了鲁棒泛化

Method: 框架包含特征层和损失层两个即插即用组件：特征层通过时频对齐模块归一化个体特定运动特征，损失层通过组不变正则化损失模拟未见个体分布

Result: 在大型MA-52数据集上的实验表明，该框架在准确性和鲁棒性上均优于现有方法，在细粒度条件下实现稳定泛化

Conclusion: 该框架通过分布鲁棒优化有效解决了微动作识别中的个体差异问题，实现了更好的泛化性能

Abstract: Micro-action Recognition is vital for psychological assessment and
human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often fail in real-world
scenarios because inter-person variability causes the same action to manifest
differently, hindering robust generalization. To address this, we propose the
Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework, which
integrates Distributionally Robust Optimization principles to learn
person-agnostic representations. Our framework contains two plug-and-play
components operating at the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, the
Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module normalizes person-specific motion
characteristics with a dual-branch design: the temporal branch applies
Wasserstein-regularized alignment to stabilize dynamic trajectories, while the
frequency branch introduces variance-guided perturbations to enhance robustness
against person-specific spectral differences. A consistency-driven fusion
mechanism integrates both branches. At the loss level, the Group-Invariant
Regularized Loss partitions samples into pseudo-groups to simulate unseen
person-specific distributions. By up-weighting boundary cases and regularizing
subgroup variance, it forces the model to generalize beyond easy or frequent
samples, thus enhancing robustness to difficult variations. Experiments on the
large-scale MA-52 dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under
fine-grained conditions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于3D几何基础模型VGGT的语义匹配方法，解决了现有方法在几何歧义和最近邻规则方面的局限性，通过保留VGGT内在优势并适应语义匹配场景，实现了优越的几何感知和匹配可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义匹配方法存在两个主要问题：(i)几何歧义：依赖2D基础模型特征难以区分对称结构，需要额外微调但缺乏泛化能力；(ii)最近邻规则：像素级匹配忽略了跨图像不可见性和流形保持。这些问题需要几何感知的像素描述符和整体密集对应机制。

Method: 方法包括：(i)保留VGGT内在优势：重用早期特征阶段，微调后期阶段，添加语义头实现双向对应；(ii)在数据稀缺情况下适应语义匹配：通过循环一致性训练策略、合成数据增强以及带有混叠伪影缓解的渐进训练方案。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在几何感知、匹配可靠性和流形保持方面表现优越，超越了之前的基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过利用3D几何基础模型VGGT并针对语义匹配场景进行适应性改进，本文提出的方法有效解决了现有语义匹配方法的局限性，实现了更可靠的像素级对应关系。

Abstract: Semantic matching aims to establish pixel-level correspondences between
instances of the same category and represents a fundamental task in computer
vision. Existing approaches suffer from two limitations: (i) Geometric
Ambiguity: Their reliance on 2D foundation model features (e.g., Stable
Diffusion, DINO) often fails to disambiguate symmetric structures, requiring
extra fine-tuning yet lacking generalization; (ii) Nearest-Neighbor Rule: Their
pixel-wise matching ignores cross-image invisibility and neglects manifold
preservation. These challenges call for geometry-aware pixel descriptors and
holistic dense correspondence mechanisms. Inspired by recent advances in 3D
geometric foundation models, we turn to VGGT, which provides geometry-grounded
features and holistic dense matching capabilities well aligned with these
needs. However, directly transferring VGGT is challenging, as it was originally
designed for geometry matching within cross views of a single instance,
misaligned with cross-instance semantic matching, and further hindered by the
scarcity of dense semantic annotations. To address this, we propose an approach
that (i) retains VGGT's intrinsic strengths by reusing early feature stages,
fine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head for bidirectional
correspondences; and (ii) adapts VGGT to the semantic matching scenario under
data scarcity through cycle-consistent training strategy, synthetic data
augmentation, and progressive training recipe with aliasing artifact
mitigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation,
outperforming previous baselines.

Method: 提出MedVSR框架：1）Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP)模块，通过状态空间模型将远距离帧投影为控制矩阵，选择性传播一致信息特征以解决对齐问题；2）Inner State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR)模块，结合长程空间特征学习和大核短程信息聚合，增强组织结构并减少伪影。

Result: 在四个医学数据集（包括内窥镜和白内障手术）上的实验表明，MedVSR在重建性能和处理效率上显著优于现有VSR模型。

Conclusion: MedVSR是针对医学视频超分辨率任务的定制化解决方案，有效解决了医学视频特有的挑战，为临床诊断提供了更可靠的超分辨率结果。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) medical videos are vital for accurate diagnosis, yet are
hard to acquire due to hardware limitations and physiological constraints.
Clinically, the collected low-resolution (LR) medical videos present unique
challenges for video super-resolution (VSR) models, including camera shake,
noise, and abrupt frame transitions, which result in significant optical flow
errors and alignment difficulties. Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit
continuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to
introducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this
end, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs
Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by
projecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models,
enabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to
neighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner
State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and
reduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and
large-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four
datasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract
surgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in
reconstruction performance and efficiency. Code released at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS)方法来稳定强化学习微调，解决了GRPO框架中梯度消失问题，并发布了大规模长链思维数据和开源多模态推理模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态推理模型面临两个主要限制：缺乏高质量长链思维数据，以及强化学习后训练的不稳定性。GRPO框架在奖励方差低时容易出现梯度消失问题。

Method: 提出Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS)数据选择策略，结合结果方差和轨迹多样性来提升奖励方差；发布~1.6M长链思维数据和~15k RL问答对；开源多尺度多模态推理模型。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中验证了所提数据和VAS方法的有效性。理论分析表明奖励方差下界了期望策略梯度幅度，VAS是实现这一保证的实用机制。

Conclusion: 该工作通过VAS方法解决了RL微调的不稳定性问题，并提供大规模高质量数据资源和开源模型，为社区建立了标准化基准。

Abstract: Large multimodal reasoning models have achieved rapid progress, but their
advancement is constrained by two major limitations: the absence of open,
large-scale, high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, and the instability
of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in post-training. Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), the standard framework for RL fine-tuning, is prone
to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low, which weakens optimization
signals and impairs convergence. This work makes three contributions: (1) We
propose Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), a data selection strategy guided by
Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory
diversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. (2) We
release large-scale, carefully curated resources containing ~1.6M long CoT
cold-start data and ~15k RL QA pairs, designed to ensure quality, difficulty,
and diversity, along with a fully reproducible end-to-end training codebase.
(3) We open-source a family of multimodal reasoning models in multiple scales,
establishing standardized baselines for the community. Experiments across
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both the
curated data and the proposed VAS. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses
provide further insight into the contributions of each component. In addition,
we theoretically establish that reward variance lower-bounds the expected
policy gradient magnitude, with VAS serving as a practical mechanism to realize
this guarantee. Our code, data, and checkpoints are available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer架构的海洋科学基础模型，通过在Sentinel-3 OLCI数据上进行预训练，并在两个下游海洋观测任务上验证其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋科学中标记数据稀缺且收集成本高，而AI基础模型具有利用大量未标记数据的潜力，可以改变海洋科学中的AI应用。

Method: 使用Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer架构，在Sentinel-3海洋和陆地颜色仪器(OLCI)数据上进行预训练，然后通过微调应用于叶绿素浓度量化和海洋初级生产力估计两个下游任务。

Result: 模型在海洋监测中表现出实用性，特别是在利用少量高质量标记数据和捕捉详细海洋颜色空间模式方面表现良好，同时能够匹配点观测数据。

Conclusion: 新一代地理空间AI模型有潜力为海洋生态系统及其在全球气候过程中的作用提供更稳健、数据驱动的见解。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation models (FMs), pre-trained on massive
unlabelled datasets, have the potential to drastically change AI applications
in ocean science, where labelled data are often sparse and expensive to
collect. In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO
Vision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data
from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the
model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first
assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify
chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote
sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate
the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making
use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed
spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We
conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to
provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role
in global climate processes.

TL;DR: SHINE是一个无需训练的框架，用于实现无缝、高保真的图像合成，通过利用预训练扩散模型的物理先验来解决复杂光照和高分辨率输入下的合成挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像合成模型在处理复杂光照（如准确阴影、水面反射）和多样化高分辨率输入时存在困难。虽然现代文本到图像扩散模型已编码了必要的物理和分辨率先验，但缺乏合适的框架来释放这些能力。

Method: SHINE引入流形导向锚点损失，利用预训练定制适配器（如IP-Adapter）指导潜在表示以保持主体忠实性同时保护背景完整性。还提出退化抑制引导和自适应背景融合来消除低质量输出和可见接缝。

Result: 在ComplexCompo和DreamEditBench基准测试中，SHINE在标准指标（如DINOv2）和人类对齐评分（如DreamSim、ImageReward、VisionReward）上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SHINE提供了一个有效的训练免费框架，能够充分利用扩散模型的先验知识，在复杂光照条件下实现高质量的图像合成效果。

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a
new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate
shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern
text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential
physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without
resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually
inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a
training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized
Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained
customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject
representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression
guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate
low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous
benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and
challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate
shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and
DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g.,
DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).
Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.

TL;DR: 本文提出了QuantVGGT，首个针对视觉几何基础Transformer（VGGT）的量化框架，通过双平滑细粒度量化和噪声过滤多样性采样技术，在4位量化下实现3.7倍内存减少和2.5倍加速，同时保持98%以上的重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于学习的3D重建模型（如VGGT）虽然取得了显著进展，但其巨大的计算和内存成本严重阻碍了实际部署。后训练量化（PTQ）在压缩十亿级VGGT时面临独特挑战：数据无关的特殊令牌导致重尾激活分布，而3D数据的多视图特性使校准样本选择极不稳定。

Method: 1. 双平滑细粒度量化：结合预全局Hadamard旋转和后局部通道平滑，缓解重尾分布和通道间方差；2. 噪声过滤多样性采样：通过深层统计过滤异常值，构建帧感知的多样化校准簇以确保稳定的量化范围。

Result: QuantVGGT在不同基准和位宽下均达到最先进结果，大幅超越之前的通用量化方法。4位量化可实现3.7倍内存减少和2.5倍硬件推理加速，重建精度保持在完整精度模型的98%以上。

Conclusion: QuantVGGT在资源受限场景下展现出巨大优势和实用性，为大规模3D重建模型的部署提供了有效的量化解决方案。

Abstract: Learning-based 3D reconstruction models, represented by Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformers (VGGTs), have made remarkable progress with the use of
large-scale transformers. Their prohibitive computational and memory costs
severely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has
become a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we
empirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing
billion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed
activation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes
calibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first
Quantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two
technical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained
Quantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local
channel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel
variance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which
filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse
calibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results
across different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin. We highlight
that our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7$\times$ memory reduction and
2.5$\times$ acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy above 98\% of its full-precision counterpart. This
demonstrates the vast advantages and practicality of QuantVGGT in
resource-constrained scenarios. Our code is released in

TL;DR: NewtonGen是一个结合数据驱动合成与可学习物理原理的框架，通过可训练的神经牛顿动力学(NND)来建模和预测牛顿运动，从而在视频生成过程中注入潜在动力学约束，实现物理一致且参数可控的视频合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模文本到视频生成的主要瓶颈是物理一致性和可控性。现有模型经常产生不真实的运动（如物体向上坠落）或速度和方向的突变，且缺乏精确的参数控制，难以在不同初始条件下生成物理一致的动态效果。

Method: 提出NewtonGen框架，核心是可训练的神经牛顿动力学(NND)，能够建模和预测各种牛顿运动，将潜在动力学约束注入视频生成过程。通过联合利用数据先验和动力学指导来实现物理一致的视频合成。

Result: 该方法能够生成物理一致性更强的视频内容，并提供精确的参数控制能力，解决了现有模型在物理动态建模方面的局限性。

Conclusion: NewtonGen通过整合数据驱动合成与可学习物理原理，为文本到视频生成提供了物理一致性和可控性的有效解决方案，突破了当前模型仅从外观学习运动分布的局限性。

Abstract: A primary bottleneck in large-scale text-to-video generation today is
physical consistency and controllability. Despite recent advances,
state-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects
falling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these
models lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically
consistent dynamics under different initial conditions. We argue that this
fundamental limitation stems from current models learning motion distributions
solely from appearance, while lacking an understanding of the underlying
dynamics. In this work, we propose NewtonGen, a framework that integrates
data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles. At its core lies
trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND), which can model and predict a
variety of Newtonian motions, thereby injecting latent dynamical constraints
into the video generation process. By jointly leveraging data priors and
dynamical guidance, NewtonGen enables physically consistent video synthesis
with precise parameter control.

Abstract: We present SD3.5-Flash, an efficient few-step distillation framework that
brings high-quality image generation to accessible consumer devices. Our
approach distills computationally prohibitive rectified flow models through a
reformulated distribution matching objective tailored specifically for few-step

Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder
restructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid
generation and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware
configurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices,
from mobile phones to desktop computers. Through extensive evaluation including
large-scale user studies, we demonstrate that SD3.5-Flash consistently
outperforms existing few-step methods, making advanced generative AI truly
accessible for practical deployment.
