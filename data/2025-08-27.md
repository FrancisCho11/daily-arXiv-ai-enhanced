TL;DR: 海底三维物体检测面临训练数据稀缺挑战，本文提出两种无需真实训练数据的检测方法：基于合成数据的深度学习和基于模板匹配的方法。模板匹配方法在真实地球数据上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海底三维物体检测面临真实训练数据获取困难、成本高、逻辑复杂等挑战，需要开发不依赖真实训练数据的可靠检测方法。

Method: 提出两种方法：1）基于物理模拟的声纳合成数据训练最新神经网络；2）基于几何先验知识的模型基模板匹配系统。

Result: 在波罗的海真实测深数据上：合成数据训练的神经网络在模拟场景上达到98% mAP，但在真实数据上下降到40% mAP；模板匹配方法在真实数据上达到83% mAP，且不需训练。

Conclusion: 模板匹配方法在海底检测任务中表现出更好的稳健性和适应性，挑战了深度学习在数据稀缺环境中的传统观念，为自主潜艇导航、海洋考古等领域开启了新可能性。

Abstract: Underwater 3D object detection remains one of the most challenging frontiers
in computer vision, where traditional approaches struggle with the harsh
acoustic environment and scarcity of training data. While deep learning has
revolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a
critical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively
expensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert
surveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental
question: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without
real-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing
two paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam
echo-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar
simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art
neural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that
leverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry
surveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks
trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated
scenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.
Conversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data
without requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic
noise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom
about data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first
large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work
opens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine
archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments
where traditional machine learning approaches fail.

Abstract: The detection of brain tumor in MRI is an important aspect of ensuring timely
diagnostics and treatment; however, manual analysis is commonly long and
error-prone. Current approaches are not universal because they have limited
generalization to heterogeneous tumors, are computationally inefficient, are
not interpretable, and lack transparency, thus limiting trustworthiness. To
overcome these issues, we introduce MobileDenseAttn, a fusion model of dual
streams of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 that can help gradually improve the
feature representation scale, computing efficiency, and visual explanations via
GradCAM. Our model uses feature level fusion and is trained on an augmented
dataset of 6,020 MRI scans representing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors,
and normal samples. Measured under strict 5-fold cross-validation protocols,
MobileDenseAttn provides a training accuracy of 99.75%, a testing accuracy of
98.35%, and a stable F1 score of 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743 to 0.9920). The
extensive validation shows the stability of the model, and the comparative
analysis proves that it is a great advancement over the baseline models (VGG19,
DenseNet201, MobileNetV2) with a +3.67% accuracy increase and a 39.3% decrease
in training time compared to VGG19. The GradCAM heatmaps clearly show
tumor-affected areas, offering clinically significant localization and
improving interpretability. These findings position MobileDenseAttn as an
efficient, high performance, interpretable model with a high probability of
becoming a clinically practical tool in identifying brain tumors in the real
world.

### [3] [Can VLMs Recall Factual Associations From Visual References?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18297)
*Dhananjay Ashok,Ashutosh Chaubey,Hirona J. Arai,Jonathan May,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型在视觉实体引用时存在系统性缺陷，相比文本引用，视觉引用的事实回忆能力显著下降，模型难以将内部知识与图像表示链接


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别视觉语言模型在多模态基础方面的系统性缺陷，特别是当实体引用从文本变为视觉时模型性能的显著下降

Method: 通过对照研究分析VLMs的表现差异，使用内部状态模式探测来识别模型不可靠响应的情况，并应用选择性预测方法

Result: 视觉引用使事实知识回忆能力减半，内部状态探测达到92%以上的准确率来标记不可靠响应，选择性预测使覆盖率提高7.87%同时降低错误风险0.9%

Conclusion: VLMs存在可检测的系统性缺陷，内部状态探测可有效识别模型失败情况，这为多模态基础研究提供了重要方向和改进建议

Abstract: Through a controlled study, we identify a systematic deficiency in the
multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs). While VLMs can recall
factual associations when provided a textual reference to an entity; their
ability to do so is significantly diminished when the reference is visual
instead. Forcing VLMs to rely on image representations of an entity halves
their ability to recall factual knowledge, suggesting that VLMs struggle to
link their internal knowledge of an entity with its image representation. We
show that such linking failures are correlated with the expression of distinct
patterns in model internal states, and that probes on these internal states
achieve over 92% accuracy at flagging cases where the VLM response is
unreliable. These probes can be applied, without retraining, to identify when a
VLM will fail to correctly answer a question that requires an understanding of
multimodal input. When used to facilitate selective prediction on a visual
question answering task, the probes increase coverage by 7.87% (absolute) while
also reducing the risk of error by 0.9% (absolute). Addressing the systematic,
detectable deficiency is an important avenue in language grounding, and we
provide informed recommendations for future directions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种语义感知的神经重建方法，从稀疏图像生成高保真3D模型，通过添加基于补丁的语义逻辑来丰富神经隐式表示，并引入基于几何基元掩码的正则化来缓解形状模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏输入中因特征不匹配导致的严重辐射模糊问题，提高稀疏图像条件下的3D重建质量。

Method: 在符号距离场和辐射场的基础上优化添加基于补丁的语义逻辑，并引入基于几何基元掩码的新型正则化方法。

Result: 在DTU数据集上，相比SparseNeuS和VolRecon分别减少了44%和20%的平均倒角距离；作为NeuS和Neuralangelo等密集重建基线的插件，平均误差分别降低了69%和68%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了稀疏输入下的辐射模糊问题，显著提升了3D重建的精度和保真度，可作为现有重建方法的有效补充。

Abstract: We propose a semantic-aware neural reconstruction method to generate 3D
high-fidelity models from sparse images. To tackle the challenge of severe
radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse input, we enrich
neural implicit representations by adding patch-based semantic logits that are
optimized together with the signed distance field and the radiance field. A
novel regularization based on the geometric primitive masks is introduced to
mitigate shape ambiguity. The performance of our approach has been verified in
experimental evaluation. The average chamfer distances of our reconstruction on
the DTU dataset can be reduced by 44% for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon. When
working as a plugin for those dense reconstruction baselines such as NeuS and
Neuralangelo, the average error on the DTU dataset can be reduced by 69% and
68% respectively.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用轻量级深度学习模型和集成方法在AerialWaste数据集上进行非法垃圾填埋场检测，达到92%以上的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非法垃圾填埋场对全球构成严重威胁，但人工识别困难且缺乏高质量公开数据集。需要开发自动化检测方法来节省时间和资源。

Method: 使用Mobilenetv2、Googlenet、Densenet、MobileVit等轻量级深度学习模型，避免过拟合问题，并采用集成融合技术结合最佳模型。

Result: 集成模型在AerialWaste数据集上实现92.33%准确率、92.67%精确率、92.33%灵敏度、92.41% F1分数和92.71%特异性。

Conclusion: 轻量级模型配合集成方法能有效检测非法垃圾填埋场，为解决这一环境问题提供了可行的技术方案。

Abstract: Illegal landfills are posing as a hazardous threat to people all over the
world. Due to the arduous nature of manually identifying the location of
landfill, many landfills go unnoticed by authorities and later cause dangerous
harm to people and environment. Deep learning can play a significant role in
identifying these landfills while saving valuable time, manpower and resources.
Despite being a burning concern, good quality publicly released datasets for
illegal landfill detection are hard to find due to security concerns. However,
AerialWaste Dataset is a large collection of 10434 images of Lombardy region of
Italy. The images are of varying qualities, collected from three different
sources: AGEA Orthophotos, WorldView-3, and Google Earth. The dataset contains
professionally curated, diverse and high-quality images which makes it
particularly suitable for scalable and impactful research. As we trained
several models to compare results, we found complex and heavy models to be
prone to overfitting and memorizing training data instead of learning patterns.
Therefore, we chose lightweight simpler models which could leverage general
features from the dataset. In this study, Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet,
MobileVit and other lightweight deep learning models were used to train and
validate the dataset as they achieved significant success with less
overfitting. As we saw substantial improvement in the performance using some of
these models, we combined the best performing models and came up with an
ensemble model. With the help of ensemble and fusion technique, binary
classification could be performed on this dataset with 92.33% accuracy, 92.67%
precision, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.41% F1 score and 92.71% specificity.

*Jiangfeng Sun,Sihao He,Zhonghong Ou,Meina Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSU是一个新颖的多模态情感分析框架，通过整合模态特定结构信息和跨模态语义对齐来提升多模态表示质量，在性能和计算效率方面均优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态融合方法忽视了模态特定结构依赖和语义错位问题，限制了模型的质量、可解释性和鲁棒性

Method: 提出Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU)框架，包括：1）动态构建模态特定图（文本使用语言句法，音视频使用轻量级文本引导注意力机制）；2）引入基于全局文本语义的语义锚点作为跨模态对齐中心；3）开发多视图对比学习目标

Result: 在CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI基准数据集上达到最先进性能，同时显著降低计算开销，定性分析验证了模型的可解释性和捕捉细微情感模式的能力

Conclusion: SSU框架通过系统整合结构信息和语义对齐，有效解决了多模态情感分析中的关键挑战，在性能、效率和可解释性方面均有显著提升

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to infer emotional states by
effectively integrating textual, acoustic, and visual modalities. Despite
notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect
modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting
their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU),
which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and
cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations.
Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging
linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism
for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal
relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic
anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal
alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across
modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective
that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence
across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used
benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing
computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative
analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture
nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.

*Hao Liang,Zhixuan Ge,Ashish Tiwari,Soumendu Majee,G. M. Dilshan Godaliyadda,Ashok Veeraraghavan,Guha Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastAvatar是一个基于3D高斯泼溅的快速单图像人脸3D重建框架，能够在10毫秒内从任意姿态的单张人脸图像生成高质量的3DGS模型，比优化方法快1000倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3DGS人脸生成方法要么需要每张人脸单独优化（速度慢），要么前馈方法重建质量不足。需要一种既能保持高质量重建又能实现实时推理的解决方案。

Method: 使用编码器-解码器神经网络设计：1）从多视角人脸数据构建3DGS模板模型；2）编码输入图像为姿态不变的身份潜在嵌入；3）解码预测模板高斯参数残差。

Result: 在重建质量上显著优于现有前馈方法（如GAGAvatar），运行速度比优化方法（如FlashAvatar）快1000倍，支持实时身份插值和属性编辑。

Conclusion: FastAvatar通过创新的潜在空间设计和残差预测机制，实现了高质量和超快速的3D人脸重建，扩展了3DGS在消费级和交互式系统中的逼真虚拟化身应用范围。

Abstract: We present FastAvatar, a pose-invariant, feed-forward framework that can
generate a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from a single face image from an
arbitrary pose in near-instant time (<10ms). FastAvatar uses a novel
encoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity
preservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face
``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures.
Second, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and
pose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict
residuals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the
template 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion,
model inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms
existing feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction
quality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g.,
FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent
space design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing
which is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation
framework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and
speed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in
consumer and interactive systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种适用于人道主义紧急场景的移动生物识别系统，采用PolyProtect生物特征模板保护方案，在人脸和指纹识别中表现出良好的准确性和隐私保护性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人道主义和紧急场景中使用生物识别技术可以提高效率，但存在数据主体隐私风险，特别是在脆弱环境中风险加剧，需要开发适合这些场景的生物特征模板保护方案。

Method: 通过制定功能、操作和安全隐私需求，比较分析生物特征模板保护方案，选择PolyProtect方法应用于神经网络人脸嵌入，并使用EdgeFace特征提取器在真实人道主义数据集上进行评估，同时扩展到指纹生物识别。

Result: 实验结果表明PolyProtect在验证和识别准确性、不可逆性和不可链接性方面表现良好，是首个在识别场景和指纹生物识别中评估该方法的研究。

Conclusion: PolyProtect方案在人道主义场景中具有应用前景，其模态无关性使其适用于多种生物特征，代码将公开发布以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: In humanitarian and emergency scenarios, the use of biometrics can
dramatically improve the efficiency of operations, but it poses risks for the
data subjects, which are exacerbated in contexts of vulnerability. To address
this, we present a mobile biometric system implementing a biometric template
protection (BTP) scheme suitable for these scenarios. After rigorously
formulating the functional, operational, and security and privacy requirements
of these contexts, we perform a broad comparative analysis of the BTP
landscape. PolyProtect, a method designed to operate on neural network face
embeddings, is identified as the most suitable method due to its effectiveness,
modularity, and lightweight computational burden. We evaluate PolyProtect in
terms of verification and identification accuracy, irreversibility, and
unlinkability, when this BTP method is applied to face embeddings extracted
using EdgeFace, a novel state-of-the-art efficient feature extractor, on a
real-world face dataset from a humanitarian field project in Ethiopia.
Moreover, as PolyProtect promises to be modality-independent, we extend its
evaluation to fingerprints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that PolyProtect has been evaluated for the identification scenario and
for fingerprint biometrics. Our experimental results are promising, and we plan
to release our code

*Fatemeh Ziaeetabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文主张在视觉基础模型中引入显式关系接口（动态关系图），以解决现有模型在需要实体、角色和时空关系显式推理任务上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉基础模型在处理需要显式关系推理的任务（如细粒度人类活动识别、第一人称视频理解和多模态医学图像分析）时存在局限性，这些任务的空间、时间和语义依赖关系对性能至关重要。

Method: 通过在基础模型中添加轻量级、上下文自适应的图推理模块，构建动态关系图（图的拓扑结构和边语义从输入和任务上下文中推断），实现稀疏的语义节点推理。

Result: 实验表明，这种混合方法相对于纯基础模型基线，在细粒度语义保真度、分布外鲁棒性、可解释性和计算效率方面都有提升，同时具有更好的内存和硬件效率。

Conclusion: 提出了针对基础模型图混合的研究议程，重点包括学习动态图构建、多层次关系推理、跨模态融合以及直接测试结构化视觉任务中关系能力的评估协议。

Abstract: Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in
computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from
large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent
limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and
spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for
fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and
multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic
dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that
next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces,
instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge
semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this
position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation
action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs
with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves
fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness,
interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines.
Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also
achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under
practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for
FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level
relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or
region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols
that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.

Conclusion: 该数据集为车牌可读性分类研究提供了重要资源，凸显了当前方法的局限性，并推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) faces a major challenge when
dealing with illegible license plates (LPs). While reconstruction methods such
as super-resolution (SR) have emerged, the core issue of recognizing these
low-quality LPs remains unresolved. To optimize model performance and
computational efficiency, image pre-processing should be applied selectively to
cases that require enhanced legibility. To support research in this area, we
introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687
annotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span
a wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality
levels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and
LP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and
illegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible
LPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image
recognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires
super-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which
remained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO),
together with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the
difficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research. The
proposed dataset is publicly available at

*Aranya Saha,Tanvir Ahmed Khan,Ismam Nur Swapnil,Mohammad Ariful Haque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLARIFY是一个专家-通用框架，通过结合轻量级皮肤病图像分类器和压缩的对话VLM，在皮肤病视觉问答任务中实现了18%的准确率提升，同时显著降低了计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决通用视觉语言模型在医疗任务中专精度不足、推理成本高的问题，为临床部署提供轻量级、可信赖的AI系统。

Method: 采用专家-通用框架：轻量级图像分类器（专家）提供快速准确的诊断预测，压缩的对话VLM（通用）生成自然语言解释，并通过知识图谱检索模块确保回答的准确性。

Result: 在皮肤病数据集上，相比最强基线（微调未压缩单线VLM），诊断准确率提升18%，平均VRAM需求降低20%，延迟减少5%。

Conclusion: 专家-通用系统为构建轻量级、可信赖且临床可行的AI系统提供了实用而强大的范式。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant potential for medical
tasks; however, their general-purpose nature can limit specialized diagnostic
accuracy, and their large size poses substantial inference costs for real-world
clinical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a
Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering
(VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image
classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic
predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the
Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In
our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's
reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further
enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the
Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both
accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic
errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on
our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an
18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a
fine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM
requirement and latency by at least 20\% and 5\%, respectively. These results
indicate that a Specialist-Generalist system provides a practical and powerful
paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI
systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的上下文感知零样本异常检测框架，结合TimeSformer、DPC和CLIP模型来检测监控视频中的异常事件，无需在训练时接触异常样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监控视频中的异常检测具有挑战性，因为异常事件不可预测且高度依赖于上下文环境。传统方法需要大量异常样本进行训练，而零样本方法可以避免这个问题。

Method: 采用混合架构：TimeSformer作为视觉骨干网络提取时空特征，DPC预测未来表示以识别时间偏差，CLIP基于语义流通过上下文特定的文本提示实现概念级异常检测。使用InfoNCE和CPC损失联合训练，并引入上下文门控机制增强决策。

Result: 该框架能够将预测建模与视觉语言理解相结合，在复杂环境中泛化到未见过的行为模式，填补了零样本异常检测中时间推理和语义上下文之间的空白。

Conclusion: 提出的上下文感知零样本异常检测框架通过整合时空动态建模和语义上下文理解，为监控视频中的异常检测提供了一种有效的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to
their unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel
context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal
events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed
hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal
dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to
extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future
representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based
semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through
context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using
InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic
representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by
modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By
integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system
can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This
framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in
zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance. The code for this research has
been made available at

TL;DR: DoGFlow是一种新颖的自监督3D场景流估计框架，利用4D雷达多普勒测量生成运动伪标签，无需人工标注即可实现与全监督方法相媲美的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督方法在长距离和恶劣天气场景中性能不足，而全监督方法依赖昂贵的人工标注难以扩展，需要一种无需标注的高性能场景流估计方案

Method: 通过跨模态标签转移方法，从4D雷达多普勒测量实时计算运动伪标签，使用动态感知关联和模糊解析传播将其转移到LiDAR域

Result: 在MAN TruckScenes数据集上显著超越现有自监督方法，仅使用10%的标注数据即可达到全监督方法90%以上的性能

Conclusion: DoGFlow提供了一种可扩展的自监督解决方案，能够有效解决3D场景流估计中的标注瓶颈问题，在自动驾驶动态环境感知中具有重要应用价值

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene flow estimation is critical for autonomous systems to
navigate dynamic environments safely, but creating the necessary large-scale,
manually annotated datasets remains a significant bottleneck for developing
robust perception models. Current self-supervised methods struggle to match the
performance of fully supervised approaches, especially in challenging
long-range and adverse weather scenarios, while supervised methods are not
scalable due to their reliance on expensive human labeling. We introduce
DoGFlow, a novel self-supervised framework that recovers full 3D object motions
for LiDAR scene flow estimation without requiring any manual ground truth
annotations. This paper presents our cross-modal label transfer approach, where
DoGFlow computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time directly from 4D radar
Doppler measurements and transfers them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware
association and ambiguity-resolved propagation. On the challenging MAN
TruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow substantially outperforms existing self-supervised
methods and improves label efficiency by enabling LiDAR backbones to achieve
over 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of the ground truth
data. For more details, please visit https://ajinkyakhoche.github.io/DogFlow/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像的3D生成方法难以从卫星图像中恢复准确建筑结构，而3D细节化方法又过度依赖详细体素输入，无法从简单几何体生成满意结果

Method: 建模从插值噪声粗先验到详细几何的转换过程，开发了包含5万多个独特风格化3D建筑资产的大规模数据集Skylines-50K

Result: 广泛评估表明该方法有效且具有强泛化能力

Conclusion: SatSkylines方法成功解决了卫星图像3D建筑生成的几何精度和细节化问题，为建筑模型生成提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: We present SatSkylines, a 3D building generation approach that takes
satellite imagery and coarse geometric priors. Without proper geometric
guidance, existing image-based 3D generation methods struggle to recover
accurate building structures from the top-down views of satellite images alone.
On the other hand, 3D detailization methods tend to rely heavily on highly
detailed voxel inputs and fail to produce satisfying results from simple priors
such as cuboids. To address these issues, our key idea is to model the
transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries,
enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. We
have further developed Skylines-50K, a large-scale dataset of over 50,000
unique and stylized 3D building assets in order to support the generations of
detailed building models. Extensive evaluations indicate the effectiveness of
our model and strong generalization ability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂3D游戏中，高效识别地图过渡点对客户端自动地图生成和关卡设计评估至关重要。需要一种对单帧游戏画面进行空间过渡点检测和主要过渡点选择的对象化方法。

Method: 提出两阶段深度学习流水线：第一阶段使用Faster R-CNN检测潜在STP，第二阶段用轻量MSTP选择器融合局部和全局视觉特征进行排名。采用参数高效的adapter技术，可选的检索增强融合步骤。

Result: 在五款动作RPG游戏的自建数据集上验证。完整网络微调在数据充足时STP检测效果更好，而adapter转移在少数据场景和MSTP选择任务中更稳健高效。

Conclusion: 成功定义了新的空间过渡点检测问题，提供了基线流水线和数据集，为未来AI驱动导航辅助和数据驱动的关卡设计工具奠定了基础。

Abstract: In complex 3D game environments, players rely on visual affordances to spot
map transition points. Efficient identification of such points is important to
client-side auto-mapping, and provides an objective basis for evaluating map
cue presentation. In this work, we formalize the task of detecting traversable
Spatial Transition Points (STPs)-connectors between two sub regions-and
selecting the singular Main STP (MSTP), the unique STP that lies on the
designer-intended critical path toward the player's current macro-objective,
from a single game frame, proposing this as a new research focus. We introduce
a two-stage deep-learning pipeline that first detects potential STPs using
Faster R-CNN and then ranks them with a lightweight MSTP selector that fuses
local and global visual features. Both stages benefit from parameter-efficient
adapters, and we further introduce an optional retrieval-augmented fusion step.
Our primary goal is to establish the feasibility of this problem and set
baseline performance metrics. We validate our approach on a custom-built,
diverse dataset collected from five Action RPG titles. Our experiments reveal a
key trade-off: while full-network fine-tuning produces superior STP detection
with sufficient data, adapter-only transfer is significantly more robust and
effective in low-data scenarios and for the MSTP selection task. By defining
this novel problem, providing a baseline pipeline and dataset, and offering
initial insights into efficient model adaptation, we aim to contribute to
future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level-design tools.

Motivation: 当前最先进的音频驱动人物动画方法主要适用于语音和歌唱场景，但在复杂的影视制作中（需要细腻的角色交互、真实的身体动作和动态镜头）表现不足。

Method: 基于Wan构建的音频驱动模型Wan-S2V，通过改进模型架构和训练策略来提升电影级动画的表现力和保真度。

Result: 在Hunyuan-Avatar和Omnihuman等先进模型的对比实验中，Wan-S2V始终显著优于现有解决方案，并在长视频生成和精确唇形同步编辑方面展现出良好的应用潜力。

Conclusion: Wan-S2V成功解决了实现电影级人物动画的长期挑战，为复杂影视制作提供了更高质量的音频驱动动画解决方案。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for audio-driven character animation
demonstrate promising performance for scenarios primarily involving speech and
singing. However, they often fall short in more complex film and television
productions, which demand sophisticated elements such as nuanced character
interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work. To address
this long-standing challenge of achieving film-level character animation, we
propose an audio-driven model, which we refere to as Wan-S2V, built upon Wan.
Our model achieves significantly enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in
cinematic contexts compared to existing approaches. We conducted extensive
experiments, benchmarking our method against cutting-edge models such as
Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The experimental results consistently demonstrate
that our approach significantly outperforms these existing solutions.
Additionally, we explore the versatility of our method through its applications
in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法存在两个关键挑战：固定融合方案导致模型过度依赖预定义特征组合，限制了动态融合能力；MoE融合方法中各专家网络处理分离的解耦特征，限制了信息交互

Method: 提出DeReF框架，包含模态解耦、随机特征重组和动态MoE融合模块，在模态解耦模块中引入区域交叉注意力网络提升解耦特征表示质量

Conclusion: DeReF框架通过随机特征重组策略增强了特征组合多样性，克服了信息封闭问题，提高了专家网络对解耦特征间信息的捕捉能力

Abstract: Cancer survival analysis commonly integrates information across diverse
medical modalities to make survival-time predictions. Existing methods
primarily focus on extracting different decoupled features of modalities and
performing fusion operations such as concatenation, attention, and MoE-based
(Mixture-of-Experts) fusion. However, these methods still face two key
challenges: i) Fixed fusion schemes (concatenation and attention) can lead to
model over-reliance on predefined feature combinations, limiting the dynamic
fusion of decoupled features; ii) in MoE-based fusion methods, each expert
network handles separate decoupled features, which limits information
interaction among the decoupled features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion framework (DeReF), which
devises a random feature reorganization strategy between modalities decoupling
and dynamic MoE fusion modules.Its advantages are: i) it increases the
diversity of feature combinations and granularity, enhancing the generalization
ability of the subsequent expert networks; ii) it overcomes the problem of
information closure and helps expert networks better capture information among
decoupled features. Additionally, we incorporate a regional cross-attention
network within the modality decoupling module to improve the representation
quality of decoupled features. Extensive experimental results on our in-house
Liver Cancer (LC) and three widely used TCGA public datasets confirm the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: ROSE是一个视频对象移除框架，专门处理对象移除后的副作用（如阴影、反射等），通过合成数据和扩散变换器实现高质量视频修复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频对象移除方法在处理对象副作用（阴影、反射、光照、半透明和镜像效果）时表现不佳，主要缺乏配对的监督数据。

Method: 使用3D渲染引擎生成合成数据，构建大规模配对数据集；基于扩散变换器的视频修复模型，通过参考式擦除定位所有对象相关区域；引入额外监督显式预测副作用影响区域。

Result: ROSE在提出的ROSE-Bench基准测试中表现出色，优于现有视频对象擦除模型，并能很好地泛化到真实世界视频场景。

Conclusion: 该框架通过系统性处理对象副作用和合成数据生成，显著提升了视频对象移除的质量和泛化能力。

Abstract: Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent
success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects
of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to
eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision.
This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework
that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be
categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency
and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the
aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data
generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data
preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,
objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an
video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all
object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for
reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to
explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed
through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate
the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new
benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five
special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results
demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video
object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios. The

Motivation: 现有视频字幕生成方法存在运动-细节不平衡问题，模型往往过度强调一个方面而忽视另一个方面，导致生成的字幕不完整，影响视频理解和生成的一致性

Method: 1) 数据层面：构建HMD-270K数据集，采用运动-细节融合和细粒度检查两阶段流程；2) 优化层面：提出基于组相对策略优化的字幕集等价奖励机制，通过单元到集合匹配和双向验证增强完整性和准确性

Result: OwlCap模型在两个基准测试中表现显著优于基线模型：在细节导向的VDC上准确率提升4.2%，在运动导向的DREAM-1K上F1分数提升4.6%

Conclusion: 提出的运动-细节平衡方法有效解决了视频字幕生成中的不平衡问题，HMD-270K数据集和OwlCap模型将公开发布以促进视频字幕研究社区的发展

Abstract: Video captioning aims to generate comprehensive and coherent descriptions of
the video content, contributing to the advancement of both video understanding
and generation. However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail
imbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the
other. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a
lack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this
issue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed
the Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage
pipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2)
Optimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)
based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness
and accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching
and bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and
GRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance.
Experimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements
compared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2
Acc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap
model will be publicly released to facilitate video captioning research
community advancements.

Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBIs), play a crucial role in understanding ancient
Chinese civilization. The automated detection of OBIs from rubbing images
represents a fundamental yet challenging task in digital archaeology, primarily
due to various degradation factors including noise and cracks that limit the
effectiveness of conventional detection networks. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel clustering-based feature space representation learning
method. Our approach uniquely leverages the Oracle Bones Character (OBC) font
library dataset as prior knowledge to enhance feature extraction in the
detection network through clustering-based representation learning. The method
incorporates a specialized loss function derived from clustering results to
optimize feature representation, which is then integrated into the total
network loss. We validate the effectiveness of our method by conducting
experiments on two OBIs detection dataset using three mainstream detection
frameworks: Faster R-CNN, DETR, and Sparse R-CNN. Through extensive
experimentation, all frameworks demonstrate significant performance
improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统空间域SNR先验存在两个局限：无法有效分离跨通道干扰，以及在放大信息结构同时抑制噪声方面帮助有限

Method: 在频域使用SNR先验，将特征分解为幅度和相位谱；提出傅里叶注意力SNR先验变换器(FAST)和频率自适应变换器(FAT)；采用U型架构整合常规RGB流和SNR引导分支

Result: 在UIEB、EUVP和LSUI的4800对图像上训练，PSNR提升3.1 dB，SSIM提升0.08，成功恢复水下场景的颜色、纹理和对比度

Conclusion: 频域SNR先验比空间域方法更有效，SFormer方法在各项指标上超越近期方法，显著提升水下图像增强质量

Abstract: Recent learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have
advanced by incorporating physical priors into deep neural networks,
particularly using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to reduce
wavelength-dependent attenuation. However, spatial domain SNR priors have two
limitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference,
and (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while
suppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the
frequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for
better channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior
Transformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight
key spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT)
bottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention
mechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped
architecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an
SNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB,
EUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and
0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in
underwater scenes.

Motivation: 现有研究虽然实现了良好的分割性能，但在射血分数估计方面表现不佳，需要同时处理单帧图像的细节信息和多帧间的时空关系。

Method: 采用分层设计：低层使用卷积网络处理单帧图像保留细节，高层使用Mamba架构捕捉时空关系。提出时空交叉扫描(STCS)模块，通过跨帧和跨位置的跳跃扫描整合长距离上下文信息。

Result: 该方法能够平衡单帧和多帧处理，避免仅依赖单帧时的局部误差累积或仅使用多帧数据时的细节忽略问题。

accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception.
The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using
convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details,
while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture
spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame
and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation
when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only
multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the
Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context
through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate
EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FPS是一种新颖的无监督域适应框架，通过冻结预训练特征编码器并优化决策边界来解决域偏移问题，避免了传统微调方法的低效性和不可预测性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无监督域适应方法主要依赖微调特征提取器，存在效率低下、可解释性差和难以扩展到现代架构的问题。研究发现预训练模型的特征空间具有域不变的几何模式，域偏移主要表现为边界错位而非特征退化。

Method: 提出特征空间平面搜索器(FPS)框架，冻结预训练特征编码器，利用特征空间的几何模式（类内聚类和类间分离）来优化决策边界，实现离线特征提取和全数据集单次计算优化。

Result: 在公共基准测试中，FPS达到或超越了最先进方法的性能，能够高效扩展到多模态大模型，并在蛋白质结构预测、遥感分类和地震检测等多个领域展现出色表现。

Conclusion: FPS为迁移学习提供了一个简单、有效且通用的范式，特别是在域适应任务中，显著降低了内存和计算成本，同时保持了可解释性。

Abstract: Domain shift, characterized by degraded model performance during transition
from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, poses a persistent
challenge for deploying deep learning systems. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods predominantly rely on fine-tuning feature extractors -
an approach limited by inefficiency, reduced interpretability, and poor
scalability to modern architectures.
  Our analysis reveals that models pretrained on large-scale data exhibit
domain-invariant geometric patterns in their feature space, characterized by
intra-class clustering and inter-class separation, thereby preserving
transferable discriminative structures. These findings indicate that domain
shifts primarily manifest as boundary misalignment rather than feature
degradation.
  Unlike fine-tuning entire pre-trained models - which risks introducing
unpredictable feature distortions - we propose the Feature-space Planes
Searcher (FPS): a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision
boundaries by leveraging these geometric patterns while keeping the feature
encoder frozen. This streamlined approach enables interpretative analysis of
adaptation while substantially reducing memory and computational costs through
offline feature extraction, permitting full-dataset optimization in a single
computation cycle.
  Evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that FPS achieves competitive or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods. FPS scales efficiently with
multimodal large models and shows versatility across diverse domains including
protein structure prediction, remote sensing classification, and earthquake
detection. We anticipate FPS will provide a simple, effective, and
generalizable paradigm for transfer learning, particularly in domain adaptation
tasks. .

TL;DR: 提出了一种优化的混合深度学习框架，通过定制InceptionV3、LSTM架构和集成特征选择策略，实现高效的人体活动识别，准确率达99.65%，特征减少至7个，支持边缘设备实时部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人体活动识别系统面临高计算成本、冗余特征和实时场景可扩展性有限等挑战，需要开发轻量级且高效的解决方案。

Method: 集成定制InceptionV3提取空间特征，LSTM建模时间依赖关系，采用集成遗传算法ADFSA进行特征选择，平衡准确性、冗余性和复杂度。

Result: 在UCF-YouTube数据集上达到99.65%识别准确率，特征减少至7个，推理时间显著提升，支持Raspberry Pi等边缘设备实时部署。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了轻量级、可扩展的人体活动识别解决方案，适用于智能监控、辅助技术和自主监控系统等实际应用场景。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in various
applications, including smart surveillance, healthcare, assistive technologies,
sports analytics, etc. However, HAR systems still face critical challenges,
including high computational costs, redundant features, and limited scalability
in real-time scenarios. An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is
introduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and
a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first
extracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which
captures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained
localization cues. The temporal dependencies across frames are then modeled
using LSTMs to effectively encode motion dynamics. Finally, an ensemble-based
genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA)
is employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically
balancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity
reduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse
and discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to
achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental
results on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as
occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, motion dynamics, and poor illumination,
demonstrate good performance. The proposed approach achieves 99.65% recognition
accuracy, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time. The
lightweight and scalable nature of the HAR system supports real-time deployment
on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, enabling practical applications in
intelligent, resource-aware environments, including public safety, assistive
technology, and autonomous monitoring systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉细微颜色变化和建模全局变形方面存在局限，3D高斯泼溅的固定颜色分配和线性变形建模无法处理复杂纹理和一致的全局变形。

Method: 提出Colored Gaussian Primitives使用动态锚点和可学习颜色参数自适应编码空间变化纹理；设计Enhanced Deformation Model结合时间感知高斯基函数和可学习时间无关变形。

Result: 在DaVinci机器人手术视频和基准数据集(EndoNeRF, StereoMIS)上，PSNR达到39.85(比之前3DGS方法高1.5)，SSIM为97.25%，保持实时渲染效率。

Conclusion: ColorGS通过平衡高保真度和计算实用性，推进了手术场景重建技术，对术中引导和AR/VR应用至关重要。

Abstract: High-fidelity reconstruction of deformable tissues from endoscopic videos
remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing
subtle color variations and modeling global deformations. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dynamic reconstruction, its fixed
per-Gaussian color assignment struggles with intricate textures, and linear
deformation modeling fails to model consistent global deformation. To address
these issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially
adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene
reconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ
dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially
varying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex
lighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model
(EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable
time-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized
tissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical
interactions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and
benchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves
state-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior
3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\%) while maintaining real-time
rendering efficiency. Our work advances surgical scene reconstruction by
balancing high fidelity with computational practicality, critical for
intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络在不平衡数据集训练时对多数类过拟合、对少数类识别性能下降的问题

Method: 扩展洪水正则化技术，基于类别频率为每个类别设置特定的洪水阈值，抑制多数类过拟合同时允许少数类充分学习

Result: 在不平衡图像分类任务中，相比传统洪水正则化方法，提高了少数类的分类性能并获得了更好的整体泛化能力

Conclusion: 类别级洪水正则化是处理不平衡数据集分类问题的有效方法，能够平衡不同类别的学习效果

Abstract: The purpose of training neural networks is to achieve high generalization
performance on unseen inputs. However, when trained on imbalanced datasets, a
model's prediction tends to favor majority classes over minority classes,
leading to significant degradation in the recognition performance of minority
classes. To address this issue, we propose class-wise flooding regularization,
an extension of flooding regularization applied at the class level. Flooding is
a regularization technique that mitigates overfitting by preventing the
training loss from falling below a predefined threshold, known as the flooding
level, thereby discouraging memorization. Our proposed method assigns a
class-specific flooding level based on class frequencies. By doing so, it
suppresses overfitting in majority classes while allowing sufficient learning
for minority classes. We validate our approach on imbalanced image
classification. Compared to conventional flooding regularizations, our method
improves the classification performance of minority classes and achieves better
overall generalization.

*Hiroaki Aizawa,Yoshikazu Hayashi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ADM难度度量方法，结合课程学习和SAM训练，解决平坦区域中样本难度评估难题，提升模型泛化性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统课程学习在平坦最小化训练中失效，因为平坦区域的损失值和梯度范数都变得均匀小，难以评估样本难度

Method: 提出对抗难度度量(ADM)，通过计算原始样本与对抗样本的归一化损失差距来量化样本难度，并将其集成到基于SAM的课程学习框架中

Result: 在图像分类、细粒度识别和域泛化任务上验证，方法优于现有的课程学习和平坦感知训练策略

Conclusion: ADM方法有效结合了课程学习和平坦最小化的优势，在平坦区域仍能准确评估样本难度，显著提升模型泛化能力

Abstract: Neural networks trained by empirical risk minimization often suffer from
overfitting, especially to specific samples or domains, which leads to poor
generalization. Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this issue by selecting
training samples based on the difficulty. From the optimization perspective,
methods such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improve robustness and
generalization by seeking flat minima. However, combining CL with SAM is not
straightforward. In flat regions, both the loss values and the gradient norms
tend to become uniformly small, which makes it difficult to evaluate sample
difficulty and design an effective curriculum. To overcome this problem, we
propose the Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM), which quantifies adversarial
vulnerability by leveraging the robustness properties of models trained toward
flat minima. Unlike loss- or gradient-based measures, which become ineffective
as training progresses into flatter regions, ADM remains informative by
measuring the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. We
incorporate ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample
difficulty. We evaluated our approach on image classification tasks,
fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization. The results demonstrate
that our method preserves the strengths of both CL and SAM while outperforming
existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies.

TL;DR: 本文分析了水下目标检测中扇贝类别性能不佳的原因，发现定位阶段的前景-背景区分是主要问题，分类阶段存在固有特征挑战，建议根据精度或召回率优先选择不同的数据分布策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下目标检测对海洋生态系统监测至关重要，但存在图像质量退化、类别分布不平衡和独特视觉特征等挑战。不同物种检测性能差异显著，但根本原因尚不清楚。

Method: 使用DUO数据集，将目标检测任务分解为定位和分类两个阶段，利用YOLO11和TIDE工具分析扇贝类别的性能问题，进行定位分析和分类实验。

Result: 定位分析发现前景-背景区分是最有问题的阶段，与数据量无关；分类实验显示即使数据平衡也存在持续的精度差距，表明存在超越数据稀缺和类间依赖的固有特征挑战。

Conclusion: 建议在优先精度时使用不平衡分布，优先召回率时使用平衡分布。改进性能不佳类别应重点关注算法进步，特别是在定位模块方面。代码和数据集已公开发布。

Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but
poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class
distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is
detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key
research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific
performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of
under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the
object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the
under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and
TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic
stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent
precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based
challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend
imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced
distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes
should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules.
We publicly release our code and datasets.

Conclusion: 该工作填补了从2D工程图纸自动生成参数化CAD模型的研究空白，提出的框架能够保持几何精度和设计意图，为工业设计工作流程提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant
innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable
progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds,
meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge
from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings.
The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings
remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To
address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly
inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric
precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose
Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a
network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise
geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples
command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence,
and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility
in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing,
a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct
thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/lllssc/Drawing2CAD.

Motivation: 解决现有音频-视觉语音识别系统在噪声环境中难以准确估计音频可靠性并动态调整模态依赖性的挑战

Method: 使用音频-视觉特征融合路由器计算令牌级声学损坏分数，通过门控跨注意力机制在解码器层中动态重新加权音频和视觉特征，不可靠音频令牌被降权而视觉线索被增强

Result: 在LRS3数据集上相比AV-HuBERT实现了16.51-42.67%的词错误率相对降低，消融研究证实路由器和门控机制都对真实世界声学噪声下的鲁棒性提升有贡献

Conclusion: 路由器门控跨模态特征融合方法能够有效提升音频-视觉语音识别系统在噪声环境中的鲁棒性，使模型能够在音频质量下降时转向依赖视觉模态

Abstract: Robust audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) in noisy environments remains
challenging, as existing systems struggle to estimate audio reliability and
dynamically adjust modality reliance. We propose router-gated cross-modal
feature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and
visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an
audio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable
audio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each
decoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when
audio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach
achieves an 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to
AV-HuBERT. Ablation studies confirm that both the router and gating mechanism
contribute to improved robustness under real-world acoustic noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI检测标准在评价半透明VLMs时存在缺陷，准确匹配要求会罚分模糊图像中的合理多重解释，影响评价公平性。

Method: 重构HOI检测为多选题任务，每道题只包含真实正确选项和细心筛选的负面选项（避免包含合理但未标注的行为），支持多重正确答案。

Result: 提出了首个既适用于VLMs又适用于专门HOI方法的评价协议，能够更公平地评估不同方法在HOI理解任务上的表现。

Conclusion: 该新标准为HOI检测领域带来了更合理的评价方式，有助于揭示VLMs在人物交互理解方面的真实能力，为两种方法提供公平的对比平台。

Abstract: Prior human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods have integrated early
vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, but only as supporting components
within their frameworks. In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs
suggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand
images involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can
general-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do
they compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark
that can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as
HICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their
evaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is
poorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple
valid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may
capture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted
as either "throwing" or "catching". When only "catching" is annotated, the
other, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact
matching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized,
affecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid
predictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a
multiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only
ground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are
constructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when "catching" is annotated, "throwing"
is not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions). The
proposed evaluation protocol is the first of its kind for both VLMs and HOI
methods, enabling direct comparison and offering new insight into the current
state of progress in HOI understanding.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注文本选项的多选题生成，忽视了视觉选项的重要性，且高质量干扰项的手工制作成本高、可扩展性差。

Method: 结合多模态思维链推理和检索增强生成技术，生成语义合理且视觉相似的答案和干扰项，并包含内容判别模块识别适合视觉选项的内容。

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) play a crucial role in fostering deep
thinking and knowledge integration in education. However, previous research has
primarily focused on generating MCQs with textual options, but it largely
overlooks the visual options. Moreover, generating high-quality distractors
remains a major challenge due to the high cost and limited scalability of
manual authoring. To tackle these problems, we propose a Cross-modal Options
Synthesis (CmOS), a novel framework for generating educational MCQs with visual
options. Our framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning
process and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce semantically
plausible and visually similar answer and distractors. It also includes a
discrimination module to identify content suitable for visual options.
Experimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in
content discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over
existing methods across various subjects and educational levels.

Abstract: The growing integration of smart environments and low-power computing
devices, coupled with mass-market sensor technologies, is driving advancements
in remote and non-contact physiological monitoring. However, deploying these
systems in real-time on resource-constrained platforms introduces significant
challenges related to scalability, interoperability, and performance. This
paper presents a real-time remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) system optimized
for low-power devices, designed to extract physiological signals, such as heart
rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2), from facial
video streams. The system is built on the Face2PPG pipeline, which processes
video frames sequentially for rPPG signal extraction and analysis, while
leveraging a multithreaded architecture to manage video capture, real-time
processing, network communication, and graphical user interface (GUI) updates
concurrently. This design ensures continuous, reliable operation at 30 frames
per second (fps), with adaptive feedback through a collaborative user interface
to guide optimal signal capture conditions. The network interface includes both
an HTTP server for continuous video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand
vital sign retrieval. To ensure accurate performance despite the limitations of
low-power devices, we use a hybrid programming model combining Functional
Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model, allowing event-driven
processing and efficient task parallelization. The system is evaluated under
real-time constraints, demonstrating robustness while minimizing computational
overhead. Our work addresses key challenges in real-time biosignal monitoring,
offering practical solutions for optimizing performance in modern healthcare

Abstract: Online mapping models show remarkable results in predicting vectorized maps
from multi-view camera images only. However, all existing approaches still rely
on ground-truth high-definition maps during training, which are expensive to
obtain and often not geographically diverse enough for reliable generalization.
In this work, we propose PseudoMapTrainer, a novel approach to online mapping
that uses pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled sensor data. We derive those
pseudo-labels by reconstructing the road surface from multi-camera imagery
using Gaussian splatting and semantics of a pre-trained 2D segmentation
network. In addition, we introduce a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss
function to handle partially masked pseudo-labels, allowing for the first time
the training of online mapping models without any ground-truth maps.
Furthermore, our pseudo-labels can be effectively used to pre-train an online
model in a semi-supervised manner to leverage large-scale unlabeled
crowdsourced data. The code is available at

Abstract: Effective waste sorting is critical for sustainable recycling, yet AI
research in this domain continues to lag behind commercial systems due to
limited datasets and reliance on legacy object detectors. In this work, we
advance AI-driven waste detection by establishing strong baselines and
introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first
benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on
the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts
perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy.
Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern
transformer-based detectors, achieving a new baseline of 51.6 mAP. We then
propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using
spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised
training. Applied to the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, our pseudo-annotations
achieve performance gains that surpass fully supervised training, underscoring
the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the
research community by establishing rigorous baselines, introducing a robust
ensemble-based pseudo-labeling pipeline, generating high-quality annotations
for the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, and systematically evaluating OVOD models
under real-world waste sorting conditions. Our code is available at:

Method: 构建以印象标签为节点、共现关系为边的图结构，然后应用谱嵌入技术获取每个标签的印象向量。

Result: 通过定性和定量评估与BERT和CLIP进行对比，证明该方法在印象导向的字体生成任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 提出的印象标签嵌入方法能够更有效地捕捉字体形状与印象关系，为印象基于的字体处理任务提供更好的表征。

Abstract: Different font styles (i.e., font shapes) convey distinct impressions,
indicating a close relationship between font shapes and word tags describing
those impressions. This paper proposes a novel embedding method for impression
tags that leverages these shape-impression relationships. For instance, our
method assigns similar vectors to impression tags that frequently co-occur in
order to represent impressions of fonts, whereas standard word embedding
methods (e.g., BERT and CLIP) yield very different vectors. This property is
particularly useful for impression-based font generation and font retrieval.
Technically, we construct a graph whose nodes represent impression tags and
whose edges encode co-occurrence relationships. Then, we apply spectral
embedding to obtain the impression vectors for each tag. We compare our method
with BERT and CLIP in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating
that our approach performs better in impression-guided font generation.

Result: 在荷兰国家森林调查中，微调预训练模型在所有数据集上都显著超过了当前最先进方法，准确度提升达10%。

Conclusion: 传统的手工设计调和特征对于树种分类任务过于简单，深度AI特征在数据有限的应用中具有巨大潜力。通过利用公开卫星数据和预训练模型，这种方法可以有效补充现有的森林调查过程。

Abstract: National Forest Inventory (NFI)s serve as the primary source of forest
information, providing crucial tree species distribution data. However,
maintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns.
Remote sensing approaches, particularly when combined with machine learning,
offer opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While
the use of Satellite Image Time Series has proven effective for distinguishing
tree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patterns, current approaches
rely primarily on Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features and
phenology-based metrics. Using deep features from an available pre-trained
remote sensing foundation models offers a complementary strategy. These
pre-trained models leverage unannotated global data and are meant to used for
general-purpose applications and can then be efficiently fine-tuned with
smaller labeled datasets for specific classification tasks. This work
systematically investigates how deep features improve tree species
classification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise,
we extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites
data and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that
fine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model
outperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the
Netherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This
demonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for
this task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for
data-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly
available satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly
improves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can
effectively complement existing forest inventory processes.

solution demonstrates the effectiveness of modern convolutional architectures
for mitotic figure subtyping while maintaining computational efficiency through
careful architectural choices and training optimizations.

Motivation: 现有微表情分析方法主要依赖固定窗口大小的窗口级分类，难以捕捉复杂的时序动态。虽然近期方法采用视频级回归框架，但区间解码仍依赖手动预定义的窗口方法，问题仅得到部分缓解。

Method: 提出先验引导的视频级回归方法，包含可扩展区间选择策略（综合考虑微表情的时序演化、持续时间和类别分布特征）和协同优化框架（检测和识别任务共享分类头以外的参数）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现最先进性能，CAS(ME)^3数据集STRS为0.0562，SAMMLV数据集STRS为0.2000。

Conclusion: 该方法能够精确检测微表情的起始、高峰和结束阶段，充分利用互补信息，高效利用有限数据，并增强模型能力。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary, low-intensity, and short-duration
facial expressions that often reveal an individual's genuine thoughts and
emotions. Most existing ME analysis methods rely on window-level classification
with fixed window sizes and hard decisions, which limits their ability to
capture the complex temporal dynamics of MEs. Although recent approaches have
adopted video-level regression frameworks to address some of these challenges,
interval decoding still depends on manually predefined, window-based methods,
leaving the issue only partially mitigated. In this paper, we propose a
prior-guided video-level regression method for ME analysis. We introduce a
scalable interval selection strategy that comprehensively considers the
temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution characteristics of MEs,
enabling precise spotting of the onset, apex, and offset phases. In addition,
we introduce a synergistic optimization framework, in which the spotting and
recognition tasks share parameters except for the classification heads. This
fully exploits complementary information, makes more efficient use of limited
data, and enhances the model's capability. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with an STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)$^3$ and 0.2000 on SAMMLV. The code is

Conclusion: 该量化框架提高了微行网状合术技能评估的效率和可靠性，推进了培训协议的发展

Abstract: Microsurgical anastomosis demands exceptional dexterity and visuospatial
skills, underscoring the importance of comprehensive training and precise
outcome assessment. Currently, methods such as the outcome-oriented anastomosis
lapse index are used to evaluate this procedure. However, they often rely on
subjective judgment, which can introduce biases that affect the reliability and
efficiency of the assessment of competence. Leveraging three datasets from
hospitals with participants at various levels, we introduce a quantitative
framework that uses image-processing techniques for objective assessment of
microsurgical anastomoses. The approach uses geometric modeling of errors along
with a detection and scoring mechanism, enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of microsurgical proficiency assessment and advancing training
protocols. The results show that the geometric metrics effectively replicate
expert raters' scoring for the errors considered in this work.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种通过测试时快速适应来改善像素级合成视频稳定方法的新方法，采用性性定位模块和有针对性的适应策略，在保持全帧输出的同时显著提升稳定性和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 像素级合成视频稳定方法虽能生成全帧输出，但因为视频运动模式和视觉内容的多样性，使得固定参数模型难以做到稳健的通用化。

Method: 提出通过测试时快速适应每个输入视频来改善稳定性。采用推理时可用的低级视觉线索，设计性性定位模块和针对高性性区域的有针对性适应策略。

Result: 方法在多样化的实际数据集上表现出良好的适用性，一次适应就能实现显著性能提升，在质量和数量指标上都超越了现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够让现代稳定器在保持全帧特性的同时超越传统方法，并提供类似于经典方法的用户控制机制。

Abstract: Video stabilization remains a fundamental problem in computer vision,
particularly pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization, which
synthesize full-frame outputs, add to the complexity of this task. These
methods aim to enhance stability while synthesizing full-frame videos, but the
inherent diversity in motion profiles and visual content present in each video
sequence makes robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. To
address this, we present a novel method that improves pixel-level synthesis
video stabilization methods by rapidly adapting models to each input video at
test time. The proposed approach takes advantage of low-level visual cues
available during inference to improve both the stability and visual quality of
the output. Notably, the proposed rapid adaptation achieves significant
performance gains even with a single adaptation pass. We further propose a jerk
localization module and a targeted adaptation strategy, which focuses the
adaptation on high-jerk segments for maximizing stability with fewer adaptation
steps. The proposed methodology enables modern stabilizers to overcome the
longstanding SOTA approaches while maintaining the full frame nature of the
modern methods, while offering users with control mechanisms akin to classical
approaches. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate
the versatility of the proposed method. Our approach consistently improves the
performance of various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and
quantitative terms, including results on downstream applications.

TL;DR: DualFairVL是一个多模态提示学习框架，通过并行双分支架构联合去偏和对齐跨模态表示，在医疗影像诊断中实现公平性和准确性。


<details>

Motivation: 医疗诊断中确保跨人口群体的公平性至关重要，特别是在影像设备和临床实践变化导致的分布偏移下。现有去偏方法通常独立处理视觉和文本模态，存在残余的跨模态不对齐和公平性差距。

Method: 采用并行双分支架构分离敏感属性和目标属性，构建近似正交的文本锚点引导跨注意力机制，使用超网络生成实例感知的视觉提示，并应用基于原型的正则化来增强特征分离和对齐。

Result: 在8个医疗影像数据集上的实验表明，DualFairVL在分布内和分布外设置下均实现了最先进的公平性和准确性，仅使用360万可训练参数就超越了全微调和参数高效基线。

Conclusion: DualFairVL通过联合去偏和对齐跨模态表示，有效解决了医疗影像诊断中的公平性问题，在保持高精度的同时显著提升了模型公平性。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness across demographic groups in medical diagnosis is essential
for equitable healthcare, particularly under distribution shifts caused by
variations in imaging equipment and clinical practice. Vision-language models
(VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity
attributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive
directions. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and
text modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and
fairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal
prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal
representations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that
separates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned
representations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are
constructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to
produce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related
information and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode
dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is
applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and
strengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves
state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution
settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with
only 3.6M trainable parameters. Code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: 提出双查询增强网络(DQEN)，通过对象感知编码器特征增强对象查询，并利用CLIP模型提取语义特征来增强交互查询初始化，在HOI检测任务中取得竞争性性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DETR-based HOI检测模型使用随机初始化的查询导致表示模糊，限制了模型效果。人类在HOI类别中是固定的，而对象和交互是可变的，需要针对性地增强对象和交互查询

Method: 提出双查询增强网络：1) 用对象感知编码器特征增强对象查询；2) 设计交互语义融合模块利用CLIP模型提取语义特征增强交互查询初始化；3) 引入辅助预测单元改善交互特征表示

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集上取得了竞争性性能

Conclusion: 通过分别增强对象和交互查询，DQEN有效提升了HOI检测的准确性，证明了针对不同查询类型进行专门增强的重要性

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection focuses on localizing human-object
pairs and recognizing their interactions. Recently, the DETR-based framework
has been widely adopted in HOI detection. In DETR-based HOI models, queries
with clear meaning are crucial for accurately detecting HOIs. However, prior
works have typically relied on randomly initialized queries, leading to vague
representations that limit the model's effectiveness. Meanwhile, humans in the
HOI categories are fixed, while objects and their interactions are variable.
Therefore, we propose a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to enhance object
and interaction queries. Specifically, object queries are enhanced with
object-aware encoder features, enabling the model to focus more effectively on
humans interacting with objects in an object-aware way. On the other hand, we
design a novel Interaction Semantic Fusion module to exploit the HOI candidates
that are promoted by the CLIP model. Semantic features are extracted to enhance
the initialization of interaction queries, thereby improving the model's
ability to understand interactions. Furthermore, we introduce an Auxiliary
Prediction Unit aimed at improving the representation of interaction features.
Our proposed method achieves competitive performance on both the HICO-Det and
the V-COCO datasets. The source code is available at

Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶AI决策过程难以解释，特别是在复杂城市场景中，深度神经网络的非线性决策边界使得理解AI决策逻辑具有挑战性。

Method: 提出损失函数来促进模型可解释性，生成稀疏和局部化的特征图，通过特征激活显示哪些图像区域对预测控制命令有贡献。

Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles.
Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data,
interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban
scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with
non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind
AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability
while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we
propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by
generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us
to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We
conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and
validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our
approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions,
yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular,
non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA
Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route
completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

Abstract: The Event-Enriched Image Analysis (EVENTA) Grand Challenge, hosted at ACM
Multimedia 2025, introduces the first large-scale benchmark for event-level
multimodal understanding. Traditional captioning and retrieval tasks largely
focus on surface-level recognition of people, objects, and scenes, often
overlooking the contextual and semantic dimensions that define real-world
events. EVENTA addresses this gap by integrating contextual, temporal, and
semantic information to capture the who, when, where, what, and why behind an
image. Built upon the OpenEvents V1 dataset, the challenge features two tracks:
Event-Enriched Image Retrieval and Captioning, and Event-Based Image Retrieval.
A total of 45 teams from six countries participated, with evaluation conducted
through Public and Private Test phases to ensure fairness and reproducibility.
The top three teams were invited to present their solutions at ACM Multimedia
2025. EVENTA establishes a foundation for context-aware, narrative-driven

Conclusion: 该框架为可扩展的行人行为分析奠定了基础，未来版本将完成完整的定量分析及其在人群动力学研究中的应用

Abstract: This study presents an initial framework for distinguishing group and single
pedestrians based on real-world trajectory data, with the aim of analyzing
their differences in space utilization and emergent behavioral patterns. By
segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a
Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and
isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process.
To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework
incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization
metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and
heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types
occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change,
motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are
designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions.
Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single,
single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different
interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the
classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork
for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200
frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the
proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space
design validation in crowd dynamics research.

Abstract: Monitoring coral reefs at large spatial scales remains an open challenge,
essential for assessing ecosystem health and informing conservation efforts.
While drone-based aerial imagery offers broad spatial coverage, its limited
resolution makes it difficult to reliably distinguish fine-scale classes, such
as coral morphotypes. At the same time, obtaining pixel-level annotations over
large spatial extents is costly and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability
of deep learning-based segmentation methods for aerial imagery. We present a
multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that addresses
this challenge by transferring fine-scale ecological information from
underwater imagery to aerial data. Our method enables large-scale coral reef
mapping from drone imagery with minimal manual annotation, combining
classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation and self-distillation
techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, enabling large-area
segmentation of coral morphotypes and demonstrating flexibility for integrating
new classes. This study presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for
high-resolution reef monitoring, combining low-cost data collection, weakly
supervised deep learning and multi-scale remote sensing.

Abstract: Traditional map-making relies heavily on Geographic Information Systems
(GIS), requiring domain expertise and being time-consuming, especially for
repetitive tasks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI), particularly image
diffusion models, offer new opportunities for automating and democratizing the
map-making process. However, these models struggle with accurate map creation
due to limited control over spatial composition and semantic layout. To address
this, we integrate vector data to guide map generation in different styles,
specified by the textual prompts. Our model is the first to generate accurate
maps in controlled styles, and we have integrated it into a web application to
improve its usability and accessibility. We conducted a user study with
professional cartographers to assess the fidelity of generated maps, the
usability of the web application, and the implications of ever-emerging GenAI
in map-making. The findings have suggested the potential of our developed
application and, more generally, the GenAI models in helping both non-expert
users and professionals in creating maps more efficiently. We have also
outlined further technical improvements and emphasized the new role of
cartographers to advance the paradigm of AI-assisted map-making.

Method: 1) 构建大规模三元组数据集；2) 引入解耦学习方案，通过风格对齐训练和内容-风格解耦训练实现同时对齐风格特征和解耦内容；3) 加入风格奖励学习(SRL)范式；4) 发布首个联合评估基准USO-Bench

Result: 大量实验表明，USO在开源模型中实现了主体一致性和风格相似性两个维度上的最先进性能

Conclusion: USO成功统一了风格驱动和主体驱动的生成任务，证明了内容与风格解耦重组框架的有效性，为相关研究提供了新的基准和工具

Abstract: Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven
generation as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity,
whereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent
antagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single
framework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and
re-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven
research. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized
customization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset
consisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized
content images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that
simultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style
through two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and
content-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style
reward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's
performance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly
evaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art
performance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject
consistency and style similarity. Code and model:

### [52] [Can we make NeRF-based visual localization privacy-preserving?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18971)
*Maxime Pietrantoni,Martin Humenberger,Torsten Sattler,Gabriela Csurka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种隐私保护的NeRF视觉定位方法ppNeSF，通过自监督分割标签替代RGB图像训练，在保持定位精度的同时防止敏感信息泄露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF在视觉定位中广泛应用，但其高保真度的场景重建会编码细粒度细节，在云服务部署时存在隐私泄露风险，需要开发隐私保护的表示方法。

Method: 提出ppNeRF方法：1）设计NeRF隐私评估协议；2）使用自监督分割标签而非RGB图像训练，生成粗粒度但具有判别性的3D分割空间表示。

Result: 实验表明：1）传统NeRF的几何表示容易遭受隐私攻击；2）ppNeSF在视觉定位任务中达到state-of-the-art性能，同时有效保护隐私。

Conclusion: ppNeSF成功解决了NeRF在视觉定位中的隐私问题，通过分割监督训练实现了隐私保护与定位精度的平衡，为云基定位服务提供了安全解决方案。

Abstract: Visual localization (VL) is the task of estimating the camera pose in a known
scene. VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the
scene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of
images or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently,
NeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality
novel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising
privacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as
sensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this
challenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess
privacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained
with photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry
representations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head
that predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving
Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation
supervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a
self-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable
scene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space
of ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding
state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了在文档视觉问答中引入检索增强生成(RAG)的效果，通过文本检索和纯视觉检索两种方式，在多页文档数据集上显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档VQA系统要么拼接所有页面（内存消耗大），要么依赖大型视觉语言模型，内存需求高。RAG提供了一种通过检索相关片段来生成答案的替代方案。

Method: 采用两种检索变体：基于OCR标记的文本检索和无需OCR的纯视觉检索，在多个模型和基准测试上进行系统评估，包括MP-DocVQA、DUDE和InfographicVQA数据集。

Result: 文本中心变体比"拼接所有页面"基线提升高达+22.5 ANLS，视觉变体无需文本提取即可实现+5.0 ANLS改进。检索和重排序组件是性能提升的主要驱动力。

Conclusion: 仔细的证据选择能够持续提升多页文档VQA的准确性，证明了其在现实世界文档VQA中的实用价值，而布局引导的分块策略在这些数据集上未能提供帮助。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) must cope with documents
that span dozens of pages, yet leading systems still concatenate every page or
rely on very large vision-language models, both of which are memory-hungry.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first
retrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from
this selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of
incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants -
text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR -
across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets
MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the
"concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant
achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An
ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the
gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent
works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts
accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring
its practical value for real-world Document VQA.

TL;DR: GRAS是一个评估视觉语言模型(VLMs)人口统计偏见的基准测试，涵盖性别、种族、年龄和肤色等多个维度，并提出了可解释的GRAS偏见评分指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在现实应用中的重要性增加，理解其人口统计偏见变得至关重要，需要系统性的评估框架。

Method: 提出了GRAS基准测试，包含最全面的人口统计多样性覆盖，并设计了GRAS偏见评分指标来量化偏见程度。评估了5个最先进的VLM模型，并强调需要从多个问题表述角度评估VQA中的偏见。

Result: 所有测试的VLM模型都显示出令人担忧的偏见水平，表现最好的模型GRAS偏见评分仅为2分（满分100分）。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型存在显著的人口统计偏见，需要更全面的评估方法，GRAS基准为系统评估和缓解这些偏见提供了重要工具。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) become integral to real-world applications,
understanding their demographic biases is critical. We introduce GRAS, a
benchmark for uncovering demographic biases in VLMs across gender, race, age,
and skin tone, offering the most diverse coverage to date. We further propose
the GRAS Bias Score, an interpretable metric for quantifying bias. We benchmark
five state-of-the-art VLMs and reveal concerning bias levels, with the least
biased model attaining a GRAS Bias Score of only 2 out of 100. Our findings
also reveal a methodological insight: evaluating bias in VLMs with visual
question answering (VQA) requires considering multiple formulations of a
question. Our code, data, and evaluation results are publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出RoofSeg网络，一种基于transformer的端到端屋顶平面分割方法，通过边缘感知模块和几何约束提升LiDAR点云分割精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法存在三个问题：非真正端到端、边缘特征判别性低、几何特征考虑不足，需要开发更有效的屋顶平面分割方法

Method: 使用transformer编码器-解码器框架，结合可学习平面查询和边缘感知掩码模块(EAMM)，采用自适应权重策略和平面几何损失约束训练

Result: 开发了RoofSeg网络，实现了真正端到端的屋顶平面分割，提升了边缘区域的分割精度

Conclusion: RoofSeg通过边缘感知和几何约束有效解决了当前深度学习方法在屋顶平面分割中的三个主要问题

Abstract: Roof plane segmentation is one of the key procedures for reconstructing
three-dimensional (3D) building models at levels of detail (LoD) 2 and 3 from
airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The majority of
current approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or
learned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering
strategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually
designed features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better
than the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based
approaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not
truly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second
is that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,
leading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric
characteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network
training. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,
named RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds
in a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer
encoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance
masks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the
segmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module
(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to
enhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,
we propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the
influence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss
to constrain the network training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微塑料污染已成为全球急诫问题，可导致肝脏感染、肠道损伤等健康风险，需要有效检测方法

Method: 采用莖光显微镜技术和尼罗红染料染色，结合卷积神经网络进行图像分割和微塑料定位计数

Result: 在276张莖光血液图像上达到92%准确率，IoU 87.4%，F1分数92.1%，精度90.6%，召回率93.7%

Conclusion: MicroDetect-Net模型在微塑料检测中表现出艰固性和高准确性，为人类血液样本微塑料检测提供了有前景的技术路径

Abstract: With the prevalence of plastics exceeding 368 million tons yearly,
microplastic pollution has grown to an extent where air, water, soil, and
living organisms have all tested positive for microplastic presence. These
particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters in size, are no less harmful to
humans than to the environment. Toxicity research on microplastics has shown
that exposure may cause liver infection, intestinal injuries, and gut flora
imbalance, leading to numerous potential health hazards. This paper presents a
new model, MicroDetect-Net (MDN), which applies fluorescence microscopy with
Nile Red dye staining and deep learning to scan blood samples for
microplastics. Although clam blood has certain limitations in replicating real
human blood, this study opens avenues for applying the approach to human
samples, which are more consistent for preliminary data collection. The MDN
model integrates dataset preparation, fluorescence imaging, and segmentation
using a convolutional neural network to localize and count microplastic
fragments. The combination of convolutional networks and Nile Red dye for
segmentation produced strong image detection and accuracy. MDN was evaluated on
a dataset of 276 Nile Red-stained fluorescent blood images and achieved an
accuracy of ninety two percent. Robust performance was observed with an
Intersection over Union of 87.4 percent, F1 score of 92.1 percent, Precision of
90.6 percent, and Recall of 93.7 percent. These metrics demonstrate the
effectiveness of MDN in the detection of microplastics.

TL;DR: ProPy是一个基于CLIP的模型，通过提示金字塔结构和祖先-后代交互机制，在部分相关视频检索任务中实现了最先进的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PRVR方法主要处理单模态特征，而强大的预训练视觉-语言模型如CLIP在该领域尚未得到充分探索

Method: 提出ProPy模型，包含两个关键创新：1）提示金字塔结构组织事件提示以捕获多粒度语义；2）祖先-后代交互机制实现事件间的动态语义交互

Result: 在三个公共数据集上达到SOTA性能，显著超越先前模型

Conclusion: ProPy通过系统性地适配CLIP架构，有效解决了部分相关视频检索任务，证明了预训练视觉-语言模型在该领域的潜力

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task
that involves retrieving videos based on queries relevant to only specific
segments. While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to
process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP
remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a
model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for
PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events,
ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that
organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels,
and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that
enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy
achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous
models by significant margins. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学预测模型需要大规模数据训练，但临床数据稀缺。尝试通过自监督预训练模型利用大规模血管几何数据集来提升小规模临床数据的表现。

Method: 使用8449个3D血管几何模型进行自监督预训练，通过计算热内核签名作为自监督目标。然后在49名患者的小规模临床数据上进行微调，评估壳副切应力的分割效果。

Result: 预训练的几何表征能够显著提升冠状动脉壳副切应力区域分割的准确性，即使在有限的临床数据上也能获得良好效果。

Conclusion: 自监督预训练模型可以有效解决医学预测中的数据稀缺问题，通过大规模几何数据学习的表征能够提升小规模临床数据的表现。

Abstract: Leveraging big data for patient care is promising in many medical fields such
as cardiovascular health. For example, hemodynamic biomarkers like wall shear
stress could be assessed from patient-specific medical images via machine
learning algorithms, bypassing the need for time-intensive computational fluid
simulation. However, it is extremely challenging to amass large-enough datasets
to effectively train such models. We could address this data scarcity by means
of self-supervised pre-training and foundations models given large datasets of
geometric artery models. In the context of coronary arteries, leveraging
learned representations to improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment has not yet
been well studied. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether a
large dataset (8449 shapes) consisting of geometric models of 3D blood vessels
can benefit wall shear stress assessment in coronary artery models from a
small-scale clinical trial (49 patients). We create a self-supervised target
for the 3D blood vessels by computing the heat kernel signature, a quantity
obtained via Laplacian eigenvectors, which captures the very essence of the
shapes. We show how geometric representations learned from this datasets can
boost segmentation of coronary arteries into regions of low, mid and high
(time-averaged) wall shear stress even when trained on limited data.

Conclusion: SuperSimpleNet通过统一多样化监督范式，在保持出色速度和可靠性的同时，为解决实际制造挑战和弥合学术研究与工业应用之间的差距迈出了有希望的一步。

Abstract: Surface defect detection is a critical task across numerous industries, aimed
at efficiently identifying and localising imperfections or irregularities on
manufactured components. While numerous methods have been proposed, many fail
to meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability.
Existing approaches are often constrained to specific supervision scenarios and
struggle to adapt to the diverse data annotations encountered in real-world
manufacturing processes, such as unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed
supervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we
propose SuperSimpleNet, a highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model
built on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates a novel
synthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an
improved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four
supervision scenarios, making it the first model capable of fully leveraging
all available data annotations. SuperSimpleNet sets a new standard for
performance across all scenarios, as demonstrated by its results on four
challenging benchmark datasets. Beyond accuracy, it is very fast, achieving an
inference time below 10 ms. With its ability to unify diverse supervision
paradigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, SuperSimpleNet
represents a promising step forward in addressing real-world manufacturing
challenges and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial
applications. Code: https://github.com/blaz-r/SuperSimpleNet

Conclusion: 该轻量级方法通过震动引导和运动补偿，有效解决了事件相机在静态场景中的限制，提高了下游视觉任务的性能。

Abstract: Event cameras are a bio-inspired class of sensors that asynchronously measure
per-pixel intensity changes. Under fixed illumination conditions in static or
low-motion scenes, rigidly mounted event cameras are unable to generate any
events, becoming unsuitable for most computer vision tasks. To address this
limitation, recent work has investigated motion-induced event stimulation that
often requires complex hardware or additional optical components. In contrast,
we introduce a lightweight approach to sustain persistent event generation by
employing a simple rotating unbalanced mass to induce periodic vibrational
motion. This is combined with a motion-compensation pipeline that removes the
injected motion and yields clean, motion-corrected events for downstream
perception tasks. We demonstrate our approach with a hardware prototype and
evaluate it on real-world captured datasets. Our method reliably recovers
motion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection
over event-based sensing without motion induction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文档的文本行分割需要大量人工标注数据，这既耗时又耗费，因此需要开发数据效率高的少样本学习方法。

Method: 采用轻量级UNet++网络结构，结合专门为神经元形态开发的连通性感知损失函数，明确惩罚线条碎片化和错误合并等结构错误。仅需每个手稿的3页标注数据进行训练。

Result: 在U-DIADS-TL数据集上显著提升了性能：识别准确率提高了200%，行交并比提高了75%，F-Measure分数超过或平了DIVA-HisDB基准检测竞赛的冠军。

Conclusion: 这种简单但高效的方法证明了少样本学习在历史文档分析中的可行性，通过重视结构保持性和拓扑学习可以大大减少数据需求。

Abstract: A foundational task for the digital analysis of documents is text line
segmentation. However, automating this process with deep learning models is
challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often
unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a
labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes
few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this
work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a
topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more
complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware
loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes
structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To
increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere
three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves
upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200%
increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over
Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even
exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection
task, all while requiring only three annotated pages, exemplifying the efficacy
of our approach. Our implementation is publicly available at:

Conclusion: 通过增强文本嵌入的3D感知能力和几何特征处理，有效解决了文本中数值单位敏感问题，提升了单目3D视觉定位任务的性能

Abstract: Monocular 3D visual grounding is a novel task that aims to locate 3D objects
in RGB images using text descriptions with explicit geometry information.
Despite the inclusion of geometry details in the text, we observe that the text
embeddings are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but largely
ignore the associated measurement units. For example, simply equidistant
mapping the length with unit "meter" to "decimeters" or "centimeters" leads to
severe performance degradation, even though the physical length remains
equivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trained
language model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3D
perception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on text
embeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods.
Firstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE),
which enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between different
units by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries.
Next, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to further
enhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features into
geometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are then
leveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluate
the proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on the
Mono3DRefer dataset. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements
over previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results with a notable
accuracy gain of 11.94\% in the "Far" scenario. Our code will be made publicly
available.

Motivation: 传统的位置编码方法缺乏几何约束，无法建立欧几里得空间距离与序列索引距离之间的单调对应关系，限制了模型利用空间邻近先验的能力

Method: 基于Weierstrass椭圆函数的位置编码(WEF-PE)，通过复数域表示直接处理二维坐标，利用椭圆函数的双周期性和非线性几何特性自然编码空间距离关系

Result: 在CIFAR-100上ViT-Tiny从头训练达到63.78%准确率，ViT-Base微调达到93.28%，在VTAB-1k基准任务上持续改进，理论分析证实了距离衰减特性

Conclusion: WEF-PE通过数学原理化的方法有效解决了传统位置编码的局限性，提供了更强的几何归纳偏置和更连贯的语义关注，在视觉Transformer中表现出优越性能

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision
tasks, yet their reliance on learnable one-dimensional positional embeddings
fundamentally disrupts the inherent two-dimensional spatial structure of images
through patch flattening procedures. Traditional positional encoding approaches
lack geometric constraints and fail to establish monotonic correspondence
between Euclidean spatial distances and sequential index distances, thereby
limiting the model's capacity to leverage spatial proximity priors effectively.
We propose Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE), a
mathematically principled approach that directly addresses two-dimensional
coordinates through natural complex domain representation, where the doubly
periodic properties of elliptic functions align remarkably with translational
invariance patterns commonly observed in visual data. Our method exploits the
non-linear geometric nature of elliptic functions to encode spatial distance
relationships naturally, while the algebraic addition formula enables direct
derivation of relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs
from their absolute encodings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
WEF-PE achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios, including
63.78\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny architecture,
93.28\% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on
VTAB-1k benchmark tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms the distance-decay
property through rigorous mathematical proof, while attention visualization
reveals enhanced geometric inductive bias and more coherent semantic focus
compared to conventional approaches.The source code implementing the methods

### [66] [FastMesh:Efficient Artistic Mesh Generation via Component Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19188)
*Jeonghwan Kim,Yushi Lan,Armando Fortes,Yongwei Chen,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过分离生成顶点和面片，减少重复标记，实现更高效的网格生成速度和质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网格生成方法存在重复顶点标记问题，导致序列过长和生成效率低下

Method: 使用自回归模型生成顶点，然后用双向Transformer捕捉顶点关系并构建邻接矩阵来完成面片，添加保真增强器和后处理框架

Result: 网格生成速度提升8倍以上，产生更高质量的网格

Conclusion: 分离顶点和面片生成的框架能够显著提高网格生成效率和质量

Abstract: Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into
sequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens
sequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably
reuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each
vertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long
token sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose
an efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and
faces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an
autoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count
to approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer.
Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single
step by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency
matrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality,
we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural
arrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge
connections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than
8$\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, while producing higher mesh quality.

### [67] [All-in-One Slider for Attribute Manipulation in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19195)
*Weixin Ye,Hongguang Zhu,Wei Wang,Yahui Liu,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出All-in-One Slider方法，通过稀疏语义分解实现多属性统一控制，解决传统方法每个属性需要独立训练滑块的问题，支持零样本属性和多属性组合操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本到图像扩散模型在属性操控上存在局限性，每个属性需要单独训练滑块模块，导致参数冗余、灵活性差和可扩展性受限。

Method: 开发轻量级模块，将文本嵌入空间分解为稀疏的语义属性方向，训练后作为通用滑块，实现各种属性的可解释细粒度连续控制。

Result: 实验表明该方法能实现准确且可扩展的属性操控，相比之前方法有显著改进，并可扩展到真实图像处理。

Conclusion: All-in-One Slider方法解决了多属性操控的效率和扩展性问题，为实际应用提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant strides in
generating high-quality images. However, progressively manipulating certain
attributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains
challenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.
Some studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.
However, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is
trained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new
attribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy
accumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical
applications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this
issue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes
the text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute
directions. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling
interpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes.
Moreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports
zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and
the composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving
notable improvements compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our method can
be extended to integrate with the inversion framework to perform attribute
manipulation on real images, broadening its applicability to various real-world
scenarios. The code and trained model will be released at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种直接生成大规模3D驾驶场景的方法，结合代理几何生成和环境表示，通过2D图像先验的分数蒸馏实现高可控性和几何一致性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经重建方法受限于静态环境和有限的场景控制，而扩散模型生成的数据缺乏几何基础和因果性，需要在这两者之间建立桥梁

Method: 结合代理几何生成和环境表示，利用学习到的2D图像先验进行分数蒸馏，支持基于地图布局的条件生成

Result: 能够生成具有精确几何的大规模3D驾驶场景，实现因果性新视角合成和显式3D几何估计，具有高可控性和几何一致性

Conclusion: 该方法成功填补了神经重建和扩散模型生成之间的空白，为机器人学习提供了高质量的大规模场景数据

Abstract: Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot
learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of
reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor
data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow
for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and
trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In
contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models
offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In
this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly
generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for
causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry
estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and
environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image
priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling
the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be
conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent
3D generations of complex driving scenes.

*Jianwen Jiang,Weihong Zeng,Zerong Zheng,Jiaqi Yang,Chao Liang,Wang Liao,Han Liang,Yuan Zhang,Mingyuan Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniHuman-1.5是一个视频角色动画生成框架，通过多模态大语言模型提供高级语义指导，结合专门的Multimodal DiT架构，生成既物理合理又语义连贯的富有表现力的角色动画。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频角色模型只能产生物理相似的动作，但缺乏对情感、意图和上下文的深层语义理解，通常只与音频节奏等低级线索同步。

Method: 1) 利用多模态大语言模型合成结构化文本表示提供高级语义指导；2) 引入带有Pseudo Last Frame设计的专门Multimodal DiT架构，有效融合多模态输入并缓解模态间冲突。

Result: 在唇形同步准确性、视频质量、动作自然度和与文本提示的语义一致性等综合指标上达到领先性能，并能扩展到多人和非人类角色的复杂场景。

Conclusion: 该框架通过语义理解和多模态融合技术，成功生成了与角色、场景和语言内容深度一致的连贯动作，超越了简单的节奏同步。

Abstract: Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they
struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's
authentic essence. Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like
audio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or
context. To bridge this gap, \textbf{we propose a framework designed to
generate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also
semantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is
built upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large
Language Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions
that provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion
generator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production
of actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure
the effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality
conflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel
Pseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to
accurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby
generating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and
linguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
leading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync
accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with
textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable extensibility to
complex scenarios, such as those involving multi-person and non-human subjects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 一种叫VFTrack的实时空间分辨率画面追踪框架，能够自动检测和追踪扫描电子显微镜图像序列中的单个碳纳米管粒子，实现弹性增长动力学分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 碳纳米管在纳米技术中关键但动态增长特征化遇到实验挑战，现有方法只能提供静态分析或需手动初始化，缺乏连续的单粒子轨迹分解能力。

Method: 集成手工或深度特征检测器和匹配器到粒子追踪框架中，通过系统性测试确定ALIKED检测器与LightGlue匹配器的最优组合。

Result: 在13,540条手动标注轨迹上达到F1分数0.78和α分数0.89。VFTrack能将运动向量分解为轴向增长、横向偏移和振荡，支持异质性区域增长率计算和CNT柱形态重建。

Conclusion: 该工作推动了自动化纳米材料特征化的进步，平滑了物理模型与实验观测之间的差距，为碳纳米管合成的实时优化提供了基础。

Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are critical building blocks in nanotechnology, yet
the characterization of their dynamic growth is limited by the experimental
challenges in nanoscale motion measurement using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) imaging. Existing ex situ methods offer only static analysis, while in
situ techniques often require manual initialization and lack continuous
per-particle trajectory decomposition. We present Visual Feature Tracking
(VFTrack) an in-situ real-time particle tracking framework that automatically
detects and tracks individual CNT particles in SEM image sequences. VFTrack
integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle
tracking framework to enable kinematic analysis of CNT micropillar growth. A
systematic using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories identifies the ALIKED
detector with LightGlue matcher as an optimal combination (F1-score of 0.78,
$\alpha$-score of 0.89). VFTrack motion vectors decomposed into axial growth,
lateral drift, and oscillations, facilitate the calculation of heterogeneous
regional growth rates and the reconstruction of evolving CNT pillar
morphologies. This work enables advancement in automated nano-material
characterization, bridging the gap between physics-based models and
experimental observation to enable real-time optimization of CNT synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AUSM是一个基于状态空间模型的通用视频分割架构，通过序列掩码预测统一了提示式和无提示视频分割，在多个基准测试中表现优异且训练速度提升2.5倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频分割领域存在碎片化问题，提示式分割模型无法处理无提示场景，需要专门模型和流水线，缺乏统一的解决方案

Method: 将流式视频分割重新定义为序列掩码预测，类似于语言建模，构建基于状态空间模型的AUSM架构，维护固定大小的空间状态，支持任意长度视频流，所有组件支持跨帧并行训练

Result: 在DAVIS17、YouTube-VOS、MOSE、YouTube-VIS、OVIS等标准基准测试中优于现有通用流式视频分割方法，16帧序列训练速度提升达2.5倍

Conclusion: AUSM成功统一了提示式和无提示视频分割，通过序列掩码预测方法和并行训练设计，实现了优异的性能和显著的训练效率提升

Abstract: Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video
segmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many
real-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and
track all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape
fragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video
segmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and
introduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single
architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation.
Built on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state
and scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of
AUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial
speedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS
2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior
universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster
training on 16-frame sequences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个4D风格化基准测试套件Style4D-Bench，包含评估协议、强基线方法和高质量4D场景数据集，并基于4D高斯泼溅构建了Style4D框架实现最先进的4D风格化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D风格化是一个新兴领域，缺乏标准化的评估基准和数据集，阻碍了该领域的发展。需要建立统一的评估标准和高质量数据集来推动研究进展。

Method: 基于4D高斯泼溅构建Style4D框架，包含三个核心组件：基础4DGS场景表示、风格高斯表示（使用轻量级MLP进行时空感知外观控制）、几何保持风格迁移模块（通过对比一致性学习和结构内容保持增强时空一致性）。

Result: 在Style4D-Bench上的大量实验表明，Style4D在4D风格化方面达到了最先进的性能，能够生成细粒度风格细节、稳定的时间动态和一致的多视角渲染。

Conclusion: Style4D-Bench将成为动态3D场景风格化渲染研究的重要资源，有助于标准化评估和推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: We introduce Style4D-Bench, the first benchmark suite specifically designed
for 4D stylization, with the goal of standardizing evaluation and facilitating
progress in this emerging area. Style4D-Bench comprises: 1) a comprehensive
evaluation protocol measuring spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and
multi-view consistency through both perceptual and quantitative metrics, 2) a
strong baseline that make an initial attempt for 4D stylization, and 3) a
curated collection of high-resolution dynamic 4D scenes with diverse motions
and complex backgrounds. To establish a strong baseline, we present Style4D, a
novel framework built upon 4D Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three key
components: a basic 4DGS scene representation to capture reliable geometry, a
Style Gaussian Representation that leverages lightweight per-Gaussian MLPs for
temporally and spatially aware appearance control, and a Holistic
Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer module designed to enhance spatio-temporal
consistency via contrastive coherence learning and structural content
preservation. Extensive experiments on Style4D-Bench demonstrate that Style4D
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4D stylization, producing fine-grained
stylistic details with stable temporal dynamics and consistent multi-view
rendering. We expect Style4D-Bench to become a valuable resource for
benchmarking and advancing research in stylized rendering of dynamic 3D scenes.

*Oishi Deb,Anjun Hu,Ashkan Khakzar,Philip Torr,Christian Rupprecht*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Articulate3D是一种无需训练的方法，通过语言控制来调整3D资产的姿态。该方法通过分解问题为两步：使用改进的图像生成器创建目标图像，然后通过多视角姿态优化将网格与目标图像对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉和语言模型有所进步，但通过语言控制来调整3D资产姿态的任务仍然具有挑战性。现有方法在保持网格原始身份的同时实现姿态操控方面存在困难。

Method: 1) 引入自注意力重连机制(RSActrl)来解耦源结构和姿态；2) 使用改进的图像生成器根据输入图像和文本指令创建目标图像；3) 通过关键点建立输入和目标图像之间的对应关系，进行多视角姿态优化；4) 避免使用可微分渲染，因其在姿态优化中信号不可靠。

Result: 该方法在多种3D对象和自由形式文本提示上表现有效，成功操控姿态同时保持网格原始身份。定量评估和比较用户研究表明，该方法在85%的情况下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Articulate3D提供了一种有效的训练免费方法，通过语言指令成功实现3D资产的姿态操控，在保持身份一致性的同时显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: We propose a training-free method, Articulate3D, to pose a 3D asset through
language control. Despite advances in vision and language models, this task
remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the
problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target
images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the
mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In
detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that
decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model,
allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We
observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation
optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between
input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated
across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully
manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh.
Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was
preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing
approaches. Project page:https://odeb1.github.io/articulate3d_page_deb/

TL;DR: VoxHammer是一种无需训练的3D局部编辑方法，通过在3D潜在空间中保留未编辑区域的上下文特征，实现精确且连贯的3D编辑


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在3D编辑中难以精确保持未编辑区域和整体一致性的问题，为游戏产业和机器人交互提供更好的3D编辑解决方案

Method: 首先预测3D模型的反转轨迹获取反转潜在表示和键值令牌，然后在去噪编辑阶段用这些特征替换保留区域的去噪特征，确保未编辑区域的一致性重建

Result: 在Edit3D-Bench数据集上的实验表明，VoxHammer在保留区域的3D一致性和整体质量方面显著优于现有方法

Conclusion: 该方法为合成高质量编辑配对数据提供了有效解决方案，为上下文3D生成奠定了数据基础

Abstract: 3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot
interaction. Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then
reconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving
unedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative
models, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs
precise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer
first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and
key-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing
phase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the
corresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these
contextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of
preserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the
consistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a
human-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully
labeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of
preserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for
synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data
foundation for in-context 3D generation. See our project page at

*Edgar Rangel,Fabio Martinez*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个基于联邦学习的协作框架，用于分割DWI序列中的缺血性卒中病灶，通过共享深度中心无关表征来解决数据稀缺和泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卒中病灶分析存在高度变异性，传统计算方法只能学习单一机构模式，缺乏泛化能力，且许多临床中心缺乏足够的标注样本。

Method: 采用联邦平均(FedAvg)算法，从14个模拟医疗中心的2031个研究中共享知识，构建深度中心无关表征。

Result: FedAvg模型在所有中心上达到DSC 0.71±0.24、AVD 5.29±22.74、ALD 2.16±3.60和LF1 0.70±0.26，优于集中式和其他联邦学习方法，在分布外中心也表现出色。

Conclusion: 联邦学习框架能有效解决卒中病灶分割中的数据稀缺和泛化问题，模型表现出强大的泛化性能，在不同病灶类别和分布外中心均有可靠表现。

Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of
disability worldwide. Clinical guidelines establish diffusion resonance imaging
(DWI, ADC) as the standard for localizing, characterizing, and measuring
infarct volume, enabling treatment support and prognosis. Nonetheless, such
lesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics,
scanner vendors, and expert annotations. Computational support approaches have
been key to helping with the localization and segmentation of lesions. However,
these strategies are dedicated solutions that learn patterns from only one
institution, lacking the variability to generalize geometrical lesions shape
models. Even worse, many clinical centers lack sufficient labeled samples to
adjust these dedicated solutions. This work developed a collaborative framework
for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions in DWI sequences by sharing knowledge
from deep center-independent representations. From 14 emulated healthcare
centers with 2031 studies, the FedAvg model achieved a general DSC of $0.71 \pm
0.24$, AVD of $5.29 \pm 22.74$, ALD of $2.16 \pm 3.60$ and LF1 of $0.70 \pm
0.26$ over all centers, outperforming both the centralized and other federated
rules. Interestingly, the model demonstrated strong generalization properties,
showing uniform performance across different lesion categories and reliable
performance in out-of-distribution centers (with DSC of $0.64 \pm 0.29$ and AVD
of $4.44 \pm 8.74$ without any additional training).

Abstract: In this paper a comparative study of the performance of three Convolutional
Neural Network models, ResNet50, Inception v3 and VGG19 for classification of
skin images with lesions affected by psoriasis is presented. The images used
for training and validation of the models were obtained from specialized
platforms. Some techniques were used to adjust the evaluation metrics of the
neural networks. The results found suggest the model Inception v3 as a valuable
tool for supporting the diagnosis of psoriasis. This is due to its satisfactory
performance with respect to accuracy and F1-Score (97.5% ${\pm}$ 0.2).

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence models for macular edema (ME)
analy-sis always relies on expert-annotated pixel-level image datasets which
are expen-sive to collect prospectively. While anomaly-detection-based
weakly-supervised methods have shown promise in edema area (EA) segmentation
task, their per-formance still lags behind fully-supervised approaches. In this
paper, we leverage the strong correlation between EA and retinal layers in
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images, along with the
update characteristics of weakly-supervised learning, to enhance an
off-the-shelf adversarial framework for EA segmentation with a novel
layer-structure-guided post-processing step and a test-time-adaptation (TTA)
strategy. By incorporating additional retinal lay-er information, our framework
reframes the dense EA prediction task as one of confirming intersection points
between the EA contour and retinal layers, result-ing in predictions that
better align with the shape prior of EA. Besides, the TTA framework further
helps address discrepancies in the manifestations and presen-tations of EA
between training and test sets. Extensive experiments on two pub-licly
available datasets demonstrate that these two proposed ingredients can im-prove
the accuracy and robustness of EA segmentation, bridging the gap between
weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models.

Abstract: MR imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool allowing to non-invasively visualize
patient anatomy and pathology with high soft-tissue contrast. However, MRI
acquisition is typically time-consuming, leading to patient discomfort and
increased costs to the healthcare system. Recent years have seen substantial
research effort into the development of methods that allow for accelerated MRI
acquisition while still obtaining a reconstruction that appears similar to the
fully-sampled MR image. However, for many applications a perfectly
reconstructed MR image may not be necessary, particularly, when the primary
goal is a downstream task such as segmentation. This has led to growing
interest in methods that aim to perform segmentation directly on accelerated
MRI data. Despite recent advances, existing methods have largely been developed
in isolation, without direct comparison to one another, often using separate or
private datasets, and lacking unified evaluation standards. To date, no
high-quality, comprehensive comparison of these methods exists, and the optimal
strategy for segmenting accelerated MR data remains unknown. This paper
provides the first unified benchmark for the segmentation of undersampled MRI
data comparing 7 approaches. A particular focus is placed on comparing
\textit{one-stage approaches}, that combine reconstruction and segmentation
into a unified model, with \textit{two-stage approaches}, that utilize
established MRI reconstruction methods followed by a segmentation network. We
test these methods on two MRI datasets that include multi-coil k-space data as
well as a human-annotated segmentation ground-truth. We find that simple
two-stage methods that consider data-consistency lead to the best segmentation
scores, surpassing complex specialized methods that are developed specifically
for this task.

TL;DR: RDDM是一个端到端的RAW域扩散模型，直接从传感器RAW数据恢复照片级真实图像，避免了传统sRGB域方法的局限性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有sRGB域扩散模型面临高保真度和真实生成之间的困境，处理有损sRGB输入且忽略了传感器RAW图像的可访问性，导致性能不佳

Method: 提出RAW域VAE学习最优潜在表示，可微分后色调处理模块实现RAW和sRGB空间联合优化，构建可扩展退化管道合成RAW LQ-HQ对，开发可配置多拜耳LoRA模块处理不同RAW模式

Result: 大量实验证明RDDM优于最先进的sRGB扩散方法，产生更高保真度结果且伪影更少

Conclusion: RDDM通过直接在RAW域处理图像，成功解决了sRGB域扩散模型的局限性，为图像恢复提供了更优的解决方案

Abstract: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion
model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data.
While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are
caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these
models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor
RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge
devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by
directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional
two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple
adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the
out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE
(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone
Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To
compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation
pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for
large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)
LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion
methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.

Abstract: Deep understanding of electromagnetic signals is fundamental to dynamic
spectrum management, intelligent transportation, autonomous driving and
unmanned vehicle perception. The field faces challenges because electromagnetic
signals differ greatly from text and images, showing high heterogeneity, strong
background noise and complex joint time frequency structure, which prevents
existing general models from direct use. Electromagnetic communication and
sensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and
transfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the
creation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these
issue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that
bridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality. We
build the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset
covering multiple signal types and tasks. By exploiting the physical properties
of electromagnetic signals, we devise a length adaptive multi-signal packing
method and a hardware-aware training strategy that enable efficient use and
representation learning from heterogeneous multi-source signals. Experiments
show that EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across
many downstream tasks, moving decisively from task specific models to a unified
framework for electromagnetic intelligence. The code is available at:
