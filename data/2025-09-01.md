Abstract: As the computer vision community advances autonomous driving algorithms,
integrating vision-based insights with sensor data remains essential for
improving perception, decision making, planning, prediction, simulation, and
control. Yet we must ask: Why don't we have entirely safe self-driving cars
yet? A key part of the answer lies in addressing novel scenarios, one of the
most critical barriers to real-world deployment. Our 2COOOL workshop provides a
dedicated forum for researchers and industry experts to push the state of the
art in novelty handling, including out-of-distribution hazard detection,
vision-language models for hazard understanding, new benchmarking and
methodologies, and safe autonomous driving practices. The 2nd Workshop on the
Challenge of Out-of-Label Hazards in Autonomous Driving (2COOOL) will be held
at the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025 in Honolulu,
Hawaii, on October 19, 2025. We aim to inspire the development of new
algorithms and systems for hazard avoidance, drawing on ideas from anomaly
detection, open-set recognition, open-vocabulary modeling, domain adaptation,
and related fields. Building on the success of its inaugural edition at the
Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025, the workshop
will feature a mix of academic and industry participation.

*Alireza Golkarieh,Kiana Kiashemshaki,Sajjad Rezvani Boroujeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种深度学习方法来分类全景X射线图像中的牙齿状况，发现CNN+随机森林的混合模型效果最佳，准确率达到85.4%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发自动化牙齿状况分类系统，为牙科诊断提供计算机辅助支持，提高诊断效率和准确性

Method: 使用1,512张全景X射线图像和11,137个专家标注，评估三种方法：自定义CNN、CNN特征提取+传统分类器的混合模型、微调预训练模型，采用5折交叉验证

Result: 混合CNN+随机森林模型表现最佳（85.4%准确率），优于自定义CNN基线（74.3%）；预训练模型中VGG16表现最好（82.3%），混合模型能更好区分形态相似的牙齿状况

Conclusion: CNN特征提取与集成分类器结合是自动化牙科诊断支持的有效途径，但需要更大数据集和进一步临床验证

Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of
dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs
with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings,
cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class
balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural
network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5
fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as
evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest
performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%.
Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by
Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination
of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable
performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction
with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental
diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and
further clinical validation.

### [3] [Q-Align: Alleviating Attention Leakage in Zero-Shot Appearance Transfer via Query-Query Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21090)
*Namu Kim,Wonbin Kweon,Minsoo Kim,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Align通过Query-Query对齐解决零样本外观迁移中的注意力泄漏问题，使用三种核心技术提升语义对齐效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模图像生成模型在零样本外观迁移中存在注意力泄漏问题，这是由于Query-Key对齐导致的语义映射挑战

Method: 提出Q-Align方法，包含三个核心贡献：1) Query-Query对齐实现精细空间语义映射；2) Key-Value重排增强特征对应；3) 使用重排后的键值进行注意力精化保持语义一致性

Result: 通过大量实验验证，Q-Align在外观保真度方面优于最先进方法，同时保持竞争力的结构保持能力

Conclusion: Q-Align有效解决了注意力泄漏问题，显著提升了零样本外观迁移的语义对齐质量

Abstract: We observe that zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image
generation models faces a significant challenge: Attention Leakage. This
challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by
the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing
Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic
alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core
contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated
spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement,
enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention
refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency.
We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and
analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance
fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

### [4] [ERTACache: Error Rectification and Timesteps Adjustment for Efficient Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21091)
*Xurui Peng,Hong Liu,Chenqian Yan,Rui Ma,Fangmin Chen,Xing Wang,Zhihua Wu,Songwei Liu,Mingbao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERTACache是一个针对扩散模型的缓存加速框架，通过分析缓存误差的两个主要来源（特征偏移误差和步长放大误差），采用残差分析、轨迹感知校正和线性化建模等方法，在保持甚至提升视觉质量的同时实现2倍推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型由于迭代推理过程导致计算开销巨大，特征缓存虽然是有前景的加速策略，但简单的重用会导致明显的质量下降。需要系统性地分析缓存误差并设计有效的校正方法。

Method: 提出ERTACache框架：1）离线残差分析识别可重用步骤；2）通过轨迹感知校正系数动态调整积分间隔；3）使用闭式残差线性化模型近似缓存误差；三者协同实现精确高效的采样。

Result: 在标准图像和视频生成基准测试中，ERTACache实现了2倍推理加速，同时保持甚至提升了视觉质量。在Wan2.1视频扩散模型上，2倍加速的同时VBench指标下降极小，有效保持了基准保真度。

Conclusion: ERTACache通过系统分析缓存误差并设计联合校正策略，成功解决了扩散模型缓存加速中的质量下降问题，为高效扩散模型推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their
inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a
promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across
timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this
work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and
decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by
inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from
error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we
propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both
error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify
reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a
trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates
cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.
Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under
aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video
generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup
while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the
state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x
acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline
fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at
https://github.com/bytedance/ERTACache.

### [5] [Video-LLMs with Temporal Visual Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21094)
*Zheyu Fan,Jiateng Liu,Yuji Zhang,Zihan Wang,Yi R.,Fung,Manling Li,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Temporal Visual Screening (TVS)任务，通过保留关键视频片段和重构查询来优化视频问答和指令调优，显著提升视频语言理解性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频大语言模型由于稀疏帧采样和帧间推理监督不足，难以捕捉细粒度时间语义，而人类能够通过拖动进度条进行时间筛选

Method: TVS作为模块化前端适配器任务，包括：(1)保留焦点关键视频片段，(2)同步重构查询为最直接形式，(3)保持答案不变性和一致性

Result: TVS在训练阶段带来7.33%的相对增益，推理阶段带来34.6%的相对增益，在视频修剪任务上F-1分数提升0.47

Conclusion: 时间信息筛选能有效改善视频语言理解，TVS可作为通用预处理方法无缝集成到视频指令调优和视频问答流程中

Abstract: Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and
focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse
frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their
training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science
principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that
universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data
by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously
reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer
consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible
answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be
seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video
Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of
reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with
focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment
focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first
benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior
approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming
while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments
demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training)
and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information
screening for improving video-language understanding.

### [6] [ROBUST-MIPS: A Combined Skeletal Pose and Instance Segmentation Dataset for Laparoscopic Surgical Instruments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21096)
*Zhe Han,Charlie Budd,Gongyu Zhang,Huanyu Tian,Christos Bergeles,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ROBUST-MIPS数据集，将手术工具姿态标注作为更高效的标注方式，平衡语义丰富性和标注效率，促进标注数据增长


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手术工具定位主要依赖分割标注，但学习方法的性能受限于标注数据的多样性。姿态标注在语义信息和标注效率之间取得更好平衡

Method: 基于现有ROBUST-MIS数据集构建ROBUST-MIPS数据集，包含工具姿态和实例分割标注。建立基准测试使用流行姿态估计方法验证效果

Result: 姿态标注能够实现高质量的手术工具定位结果，数据集支持两种标注方式的联合研究和下游任务对比

Conclusion: 手术工具姿态标注是更高效的标注策略，ROBUST-MIPS数据集及相关工具将促进该标注方式的采用和发展

Abstract: Localisation of surgical tools constitutes a foundational building block for
computer-assisted interventional technologies. Works in this field typically
focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks.
Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of
diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more
efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between
richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for
accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this
annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool
instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our
enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and
allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the
adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple
benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality
results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark
models and custom tool pose annotation software.

### [7] [Safe-Control: A Safety Patch for Mitigating Unsafe Content in Text-to-Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21099)
*Xiangtao Meng,Yingkai Dong,Ning Yu,Li Wang,Zheng Li,Shanqing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Safe-Control是一种即插即用的安全补丁，用于减少文本到图像生成模型中的不安全内容生成，通过数据驱动策略和安全感知条件向锁定模型注入安全控制信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型安全机制容易受到分布偏移的规避攻击，或需要大量模型特定调整，需要一种更有效和灵活的解决方案。

Method: 使用数据驱动策略和安全感知条件，以补丁形式向锁定的T2I模型注入安全控制信号，支持构建多种安全补丁并灵活合并为统一补丁。

Result: 在6个不同的T2I模型上评估显示，Safe-Control将不安全内容生成概率降至7%，显著优于其他7种最先进的安全机制（约20%），同时保持良性图像质量和文本对齐。

Conclusion: Safe-Control是一种有效的即插即用安全解决方案，能显著减少T2I模型的不安全内容生成，同时保持模型性能，具有很好的适应性和兼容性。

Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model
developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can
address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms,
whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under
distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address
these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play
safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.
Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects
safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a
patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches
to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a
single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability,
making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture.
We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models.
Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe
content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative
architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of
benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including
both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all
baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the
probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20%
for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial
attacks.

### [8] [GENNAV: Polygon Mask Generation for Generalized Referring Navigable Regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21102)
*Kei Katsumata,Yui Iioka,Naoki Hosomi,Teruhisa Misu,Kentaro Yamada,Komei Sugiura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENNAV是一个用于从自然语言指令和前置摄像头图像中识别目标区域的系统，特别擅长处理边界模糊的stuff-type目标区域，并在多目标和无目标情况下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理stuff-type目标区域（边界模糊）以及无目标或多目标情况时表现不佳，需要开发一个能够同时预测目标存在性和生成分割掩码的系统。

Method: 提出GENNAV系统，能够预测目标存在性并为多个stuff-type目标区域生成分割掩码。构建了GRiN-Drive基准数据集，包含无目标、单目标和多目标三种样本类型。

Result: GENNAV在标准评估指标上优于基线方法。在四个汽车于五个不同地理区域的真实世界实验中，展示了优异的零样本迁移性能和跨环境鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GENNAV系统在处理复杂的目标区域识别任务中表现出色，特别是在stuff-type目标区域和多目标场景下，具有很好的实际应用价值。

Abstract: We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a
natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility.
This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and
segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous
boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target
regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates
segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV,
we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three
distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV
achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot
transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline
methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments.

### [9] [R-4B: Incentivizing General-Purpose Auto-Thinking Capability in MLLMs via Bi-Mode Annealing and Reinforce Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21113)
*Jie Jiang,Qi Yang,Bolin Ni,Shiming Xiang,Han Hu,Houwen Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R-4B是一个自适应思维的多模态大语言模型，能够根据问题复杂度自动决定是否启用思维过程，在保持高性能的同时降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在处理简单问题时也会进行冗余的逐步思维过程，导致计算效率低下。需要一种能够自适应决定是否启用思维过程的方法。

Method: 采用双模式退火训练，结合双模式策略优化(BPO)，让模型同时具备思维和非思维两种能力，并通过改进的GRPO框架进行训练，强制模型为每个输入生成两种模式的响应。

Result: 在25个具有挑战性的基准测试中达到最先进性能，在大多数任务上超越Qwen2.5-VL-7B，在推理密集型基准上与更大的16B模型性能相当但计算成本更低。

Conclusion: R-4B通过自适应思维机制成功解决了多模态大语言模型在处理简单问题时的计算效率问题，实现了性能与效率的平衡。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking
capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning
problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems
solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose
R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on
problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both
thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply
Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in
determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first
train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which
contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a
second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy
model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.
Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance
across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks
and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as
Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower
computational cost.

*Harris Song,Tuan-Anh Vu,Sanjith Menon,Sriram Narasimhan,M. Khalid Jawed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiddenObject是一个基于Mamba的多模态融合框架，整合RGB、热成像和深度数据，在遮挡、伪装等复杂条件下实现先进的隐蔽目标检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB检测方法在遮挡、伪装和光照变化等恶劣条件下性能受限，需要更鲁棒的多模态融合方法来应对这些挑战。

Method: 提出Mamba-based融合机制，识别模态特定特征并在统一表示中进行融合，捕捉跨模态的互补信号。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证，相比现有方法达到最先进或竞争性性能，证明了融合设计的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于Mamba的融合架构能显著推进多模态目标检测领域发展，特别是在视觉退化或复杂条件下表现优异。

Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental
challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage,
and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based
detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need
for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present
HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data
using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals
across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged
targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific
features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well
across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple
benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance
compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our
fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion
strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion
architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object
detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

### [11] [RadGS-Reg: Registering Spine CT with Biplanar X-rays via Joint 3D Radiative Gaussians Reconstruction and 3D/3D Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21154)
*Ao Shen,Xueming Fu,Junfeng Jiang,Qiang Zeng,Ye Tang,Zhengming Chen,Luming Nong,Feng Wang,S. Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadGS-Reg是一个新颖的框架，通过联合3D辐射高斯重建和3D/3D配准，实现椎体级别的CT/X-ray配准，在噪声X射线条件下表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统"渲染比较"方法存在空间信息丢失和域差距问题，而现有双平面X射线3D重建方法受限于密集视图要求和噪声处理困难。

Method: 采用基于学习的辐射高斯重建方法，结合反事实注意力学习机制，专注于噪声X射线中的椎体区域，并使用患者特异性预训练策略从模拟数据逐步适应到真实数据。

Result: 在内部数据集上的实验表明，该方法在两个任务上都达到了最先进的性能，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: RadGS-Reg框架有效解决了CT/X-ray配准中的准确性和实时性挑战，特别是在噪声X射线条件下的椎体重建和配准方面表现出色。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation
remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and
real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on
iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and
domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and
shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by
dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these
limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level
CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS)
reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays
vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS
reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism,
focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific
pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real
data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments
on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both
tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模标注的3D建筑数据集，自动生成准确且语义丰富的3D建筑模型面临重大挑战。受计算机视觉中合成数据成功的启发，需要构建大规模合成数据集来支持相关研究。

Method: 创建SYNBUILD-3D数据集，包含620万个合成3D住宅建筑，每个建筑提供三种模态：LoD 4语义3D线框图、对应平面图图像和LiDAR式屋顶点云。语义标注从平面图图像中提取，包含房间、门窗信息。

Result: 成功构建了大规模、多样化、多模态的合成3D建筑数据集，包含超过620万个建筑样本，每个样本提供三种数据表示形式，具有丰富的语义标注信息。

Conclusion: SYNBUILD-3D数据集为开发新颖的生成式AI算法提供了基础，能够自动化创建LoD 4级别的3D建筑模型，同时保持语义-几何一致性，数据集和代码样本已公开提供。

Abstract: 3D building models are critical for applications in architecture, energy
simulation, and navigation. Yet, generating accurate and semantically rich 3D
buildings automatically remains a major challenge due to the lack of
large-scale annotated datasets in the public domain. Inspired by the success of
synthetic data in computer vision, we introduce SYNBUILD-3D, a large, diverse,
and multi-modal dataset of over 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings
at Level of Detail (LoD) 4. In the dataset, each building is represented
through three distinct modalities: a semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph
at LoD 4 (Modality I), the corresponding floor plan images (Modality II), and a
LiDAR-like roof point cloud (Modality III). The semantic annotations for each
building wireframe are derived from the corresponding floor plan images and
include information on rooms, doors, and windows. Through its tri-modal nature,
future work can use SYNBUILD-3D to develop novel generative AI algorithms that
automate the creation of 3D building models at LoD 4, subject to predefined
floor plan layouts and roof geometries, while enforcing semantic-geometric
consistency. Dataset and code samples are publicly available at
https://github.com/kdmayer/SYNBUILD-3D.

Conclusion: 该方法为径向畸变单应性估计提供了一个统一的框架，开发的求解器在速度和精度方面都表现出色，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in
geometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is
consequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When
working with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions
caused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography
and the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial
distortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When
considering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are
three conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)
distortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and
(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been
addressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and
unified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed
approach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal
solvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed
solvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining
similar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks
including images taken with fisheye cameras. The source code for our solvers
will be made available in the event our paper is accepted for publication.

TL;DR: 提出了Global Concept Activation Vector (GCAV)框架，通过对比学习和注意力融合机制统一不同层的CAV表示，解决了跨层概念不一致性问题，显著提高了概念归因的稳定性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的CAV在不同层独立计算时存在概念表示不一致的问题，导致跨层比较不可靠，需要一种统一的方法来确保概念语义的一致性。

Method: 采用对比学习对齐跨层概念表示，使用基于注意力的融合机制构建全局集成的GCAV，并提出了TGCAV方法来评估GCAV表示。

Result: 实验表明GCAV有效减少了TCAV分数的方差，保持了概念相关性，增强了概念定位能力，并提高了对抗扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GCAV通过整合跨层信息提供了一个更全面、可解释的框架，帮助理解深度学习模型如何编码人类定义的概念。

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) provide a powerful approach for
interpreting deep neural networks by quantifying their sensitivity to
human-defined concepts. However, when computed independently at different
layers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons
unreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation
Vector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically
consistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align
concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion
mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method
significantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept
relevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate
the effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation
Vectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We
conduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating
that our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,
enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial
perturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent
framework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable
understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts. Code

### [15] [Generalizable Object Re-Identification via Visual In-Context Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21222)
*Zhizhong Huang,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VICP是一个无需参数调整的视觉上下文提示框架，通过结合LLM和视觉基础模型，使模型能够仅通过少量上下文示例直接泛化到未见过的物体重识别类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前物体重识别方法需要为每个新类别训练专门的模型，缺乏泛化能力且需要大量标注数据。自监督学习虽然减少标注需求，但难以学习到身份敏感的特征。

Method: VICP框架使用LLM从少量正负样本对中推断语义身份规则，然后通过动态视觉提示指导视觉基础模型（如DINO）提取身份判别性特征，将LLM的语义概念与VFM的预训练先验对齐。

Result: 在ShopID10K数据集和多个ReID基准测试中，VICP在未见类别上明显优于基线方法，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: VICP通过视觉上下文提示实现了跨类别的零样本物体重识别，无需数据集特定的重新训练，为通用物体重识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models
(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly
labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces
annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture
\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes
Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on
seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only
\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter
adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer
semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through
task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract
ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning
LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables
generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific
retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K
object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and
cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks
demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen
categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

*Keshav Jha,William Sharp,Dominic LaBella*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究使用SegResNet模型在PANTHER挑战赛的两个MRI胰腺肿瘤分割任务上进行评估，结果显示T1加权MRI任务DSC为0.56，T2加权MRI任务性能下降至DSC 0.33，表明小数据集下MRI序列差异对胰腺肿瘤分割的挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺肿瘤的精确分割对诊断、治疗计划和预后评估至关重要，但由于解剖变异性和数据集有限，自动化分割仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 采用SegResNet模型（Auto3DSeg架构），通过5折交叉验证和STAPLE集成方法，在解剖相关感兴趣区域进行训练和评估。任务1使用91例T1加权动脉对比增强MRI，任务2使用50例T2加权MR-Linac病例。

Result: 任务1：DSC 0.56，5 mm DSC 0.73，HD95 41.1 mm，MASD 26.0 mm，RMSE 5164 mm；任务2：DSC 0.33，5 mm DSC 0.50，HD95 20.1 mm，MASD 7.2 mm，RMSE 17203 mm。T2序列性能明显下降。

Conclusion: 研究结果显示了小数据集下MRI胰腺肿瘤分割的挑战，不同MRI序列引入的变异性显著。尽管性能一般，但展示了自动化分割的潜力，强调需要更大、标准化的MRI数据集来提高模型鲁棒性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis,
treatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains
challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In
this study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were
trained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as
part of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold
cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically
relevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic
MRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor
Segmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated
segmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean
Average Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1,
the algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD
of 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC
of 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203
mm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor
segmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by
different MRI sequences. Despite modest performance, the results demonstrate
potential for automated delineation and emphasize the need for larger,
standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reverse Imaging是一种基于物理原理的心脏MRI数据增强方法，通过逆向推断底层自旋属性来解决不同成像序列间的泛化问题，显著提升分割模型的跨域性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的心脏MRI分割模型难以泛化到不同成像序列，因为图像对比度差异巨大。虽然成像协议不同，但所有图像都由相同的自旋属性（质子密度、T1、T2值）控制。

Method: 提出Reverse Imaging方法：1）通过解决非线性逆问题从观测图像逆向推断底层自旋属性；2）使用扩散模型学习mSASHA数据集的自旋属性先验分布；3）基于推断的自旋属性合成任意新序列的图像。

Result: 该方法能够从MR图像获得有意义的自旋属性估计，作为可解释的潜在变量，实现高度灵活的图像合成，使分割模型在不同图像对比度和成像协议下都能实现高精度分割。

Conclusion: Reverse Imaging通过物理驱动的数据增强方法，从根本上解决了心脏MRI分割的泛化问题，实现了宽谱泛化能力，为医学图像分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to significant
variations in image contrast. These variations arise from changes in imaging
protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density,
T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we
introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data
augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization
problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from
observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems
regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin
prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric
SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which
offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but
meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an
interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of
arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate
segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols,
realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHD是一种新颖的个性化3D人体网格恢复方法，通过用户特定形状信息提升视频姿态估计精度，采用形状条件化的3D姿态先验和点蒸馏采样损失来实现更好的3D准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HMR方法为通用性优化，但过度依赖2D约束会损害3D准确性，无法同时考虑个性化身体形状和3D姿态合理性。

Method: 首先校准用户身体形状，然后基于该形状进行个性化姿态拟合，使用点扩散变换器实现形状条件化的3D姿态先验，通过点蒸馏采样损失迭代指导姿态拟合。

Result: 方法不仅提高了骨盆对齐的姿态精度，还改善了绝对姿态精度，且仅需合成数据进行训练，可作为即插即用模块与现有3D姿态估计器集成。

Conclusion: PHD通过解耦形状校准和姿态拟合过程，有效解决了传统方法在3D准确性方面的局限性，提供了一种数据高效且通用的个性化3D人体恢复解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery
(HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to
improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are
designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these
methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to
improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly
account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In
contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's
body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned
on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose
prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides
the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose
prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D
constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose
accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often
overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,
requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile
plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose
estimators to enhance their performance. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的基于扩散模型的3D人体姿态估计框架，通过分层时序剪枝策略动态剪枝冗余姿态标记，在保持运动动态的同时显著降低计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成高保真3D人体姿态方面表现出强大能力，但其迭代性和多假设需求带来巨大计算开销，需要提高效率

Method: 采用分层时序剪枝(HTP)策略：1)时序相关性增强剪枝(TCEP)通过自适应时序图构建分析帧间运动相关性识别关键帧；2)稀疏聚焦时序多头注意力(SFT MHSA)利用帧级稀疏性减少注意力计算；3)掩码引导姿态标记剪枝器(MGPTP)通过聚类进行细粒度语义剪枝

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP数据集上，HTP相比现有扩散方法减少训练MACs 38.5%、推理MACs 56.8%，推理速度平均提升81.1%，同时达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 提出的分层时序剪枝策略有效解决了扩散模型在3D人体姿态估计中的计算效率问题，在显著降低计算成本的同时保持了优异的性能表现

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating
high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis
requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an
Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a
Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes
redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving
critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1)
Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by
analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph
construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the
resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on
motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs
fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most
informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that
HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves
inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based
methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: Print2Volume是一个从2D指纹图像生成逼真合成OCT 3D指纹的框架，通过解决OCT数据稀缺问题显著提升了生物识别性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCT技术能获取高分辨率3D指纹数据，但数据采集成本高、耗时长，导致大规模数据集稀缺，阻碍了深度学习模型的发展

Method: 三阶段框架：1) 2D风格转换模块将二值指纹转为灰度图像；2) 3D结构扩展网络将2D图像外推为3D解剖体积；3) 基于3D GAN的OCT真实感细化器添加纹理和噪声

Result: 生成了42万个合成样本，预训练模型后在ZJUT-EIFD基准上将EER从15.62%显著降低到2.50%

Conclusion: Print2Volume有效解决了OCT指纹数据稀缺问题，生成的合成数据质量高，能显著提升生物识别性能

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the acquisition of
high-resolution, three-dimensional fingerprint data, capturing rich subsurface
structures for robust biometric recognition. However, the high cost and
time-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of
large-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of
advanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address
this critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework
for generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D
fingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D
style transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale
images mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D
Structure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D
anatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that
renders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other
imaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale
synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the
high quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition
performance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and
fine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable
reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD
benchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data
scarcity.

Motivation: 妇科腹腔镜手术视频的手动分析过程耗时且繁琐，而现有的计算机视觉方法严重依赖样本数据，但在医学领域数据稀缺

Method: 与领先医学专家合作创建包含子宫内膜异位症区域标注的图像数据集GLENDA

Result: 发布了首个此类数据集，为子宫内膜异位症的计算机视觉分析提供重要数据资源

Conclusion: GLENDA数据集将促进妇科腹腔镜手术视频分析的自动化方法发展，支持治疗规划、病例记录和教育等术后活动

Abstract: Gynecologic laparoscopy as a type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is
performed via a live feed of a patient's abdomen surveying the insertion and
handling of various instruments for conducting treatment. Adopting this kind of
surgical intervention not only facilitates a great variety of treatments, the
possibility of recording said video streams is as well essential for numerous
post-surgical activities, such as treatment planning, case documentation and
education. Nonetheless, the process of manually analyzing surgical recordings,
as it is carried out in current practice, usually proves tediously
time-consuming. In order to improve upon this situation, more sophisticated
computer vision as well as machine learning approaches are actively developed.
Since most of such approaches heavily rely on sample data, which especially in
the medical field is only sparsely available, with this work we publish the
Gynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset (GLENDA) - an image dataset
containing region-based annotations of a common medical condition named
endometriosis, i.e. the dislocation of uterine-like tissue. The dataset is the
first of its kind and it has been created in collaboration with leading medical
experts in the field.

Motivation: 手术视频记录已成为医学内窥镜领域的重要信息源，但自动内容索引（基于内容搜索的基础）由于视频内容的特殊性仍然是一个巨大挑战。

Method: 使用基于区域的全卷积网络进行实例感知的(1)器械分割（二值分割）和(2)器械识别（多类别识别）。

Result: 即使训练样本数量较少，也能以相当高的准确率定位和分割器械区域，但确定具体器械类型仍然非常困难。

Conclusion: 手术器械分割可以达到较高精度，但由于手术器械固有的高度相似性，器械类型识别仍然是一个具有挑战性的任务。

Abstract: Recorded videos from surgeries have become an increasingly important
information source for the field of medical endoscopy, since the recorded
footage shows every single detail of the surgery. However, while video
recording is straightforward these days, automatic content indexing - the basis
for content-based search in a medical video archive - is still a great
challenge due to the very special video content. In this work, we investigate
segmentation and recognition of surgical instruments in videos recorded from
laparoscopic gynecology. More precisely, we evaluate the achievable performance
of segmenting surgical instruments from their background by using a
region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware (1) instrument
segmentation as well as (2) instrument recognition. While the first part
addresses only binary segmentation of instances (i.e., distinguishing between
instrument or background) we also investigate multi-class instrument
recognition (i.e., identifying the type of instrument). Our evaluation results
show that even with a moderately low number of training examples, we are able
to localize and segment instrument regions with a pretty high accuracy.
However, the results also reveal that determining the particular instrument is
still very challenging, due to the inherently high similarity of surgical
instruments.

<details>

Motivation: 目前WSI图像缺乏标准化的元数据标准，在AI算法训练和验证时需要通过手动检查来确定图像内容，这对包含数百万对象的大规模集合而言效率极低。

Method: 提出一个通用框架，生成WSI的2D索引地图，并为特定应用领域提供描述机制。在临床病理学领域实现，使用统一语法和语义实现不同目录间的互操性。通过三层组织结构（来源、组织类型、病理改变）构建详细的组织地图。

Conclusion: 该框架为WSI提供了标准化的元数据描述方案，有效解决了大规模集合中手动检查效率低下的问题，促进了不同目录间的互操性和AI算法的发展。

Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by
scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue
sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be
viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,
including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.
They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,
microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic
science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it
is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently
no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through
manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several
million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a
profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this
approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics
to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that
provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is
organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,
with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard
through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and
graph-based WSI representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中经常出现训练时未见的新类别，传统增量学习方法需要完全标注的数据集，这在实践中不现实

Method: 使用置信度伪标签替代人工标注，将伪标签集成到各种CIL方法中，通过置信度选择机制

Result: 在CIFAR100和ImageNet100上评估性能下降，最终准确率比最先进的class-iNCD方法高出5%以上

Conclusion: ICPL方法在无监督增量学习方面表现出色，适用于资源受限环境，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many
computer vision tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that
were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new
knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a
model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset
is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an
unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels
(ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling
incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels
into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate
performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our
approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD)
methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to
fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure
its computational complexity to validate its suitability for
resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared
to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by
more than 5% in final accuracy.

settings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation
between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging
discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue
representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative
model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables
high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior
approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data,
MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless
translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce
X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays
under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared
to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains
flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual
fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable
solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging. The code and dataset are

Abstract: Trees are key components of the terrestrial biosphere, playing vital roles in
ecosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy. However,
large-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate
modelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or
canopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In
this study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual
trees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree
crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown
centers and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on
billions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling
the model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We
compare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with
state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial
lidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how
detection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels. Our
method offers a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring,
and is adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key
requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to
dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense
Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper
presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient
training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically
organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians
represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level
Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively
activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational
overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models
motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian
spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional
adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static
regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly
reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级图像描述模型，参数量仅为125M（比LLaMA-7B小56倍），性能却能与大型多模态通用模型相媲美，并开发了Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架来解决视觉盲区问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型计算需求高，难以在本地设备部署，需要开发轻量级但性能相当的图像描述解决方案。

Method: 基于125M参数语言模型构建专家模型，并通过DeepLens提取详细视觉表示，Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架通过关注信息丰富区域来增强视觉基础。

Result: 模型在单句和详细描述任务上表现与大型多模态通用模型相当，新框架有效缓解了视觉盲区导致的语义错误。

Conclusion: 轻量级专家模型可作为设备端应用的强视觉专家，Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架通过改进视觉基础显著提升了描述质量。

Abstract: Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction
systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is
challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by
implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times
smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence
and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve
performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its
potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications.
While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it
suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning
errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes,
where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms
and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel
captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality
through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed
visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified
during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our
specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the
effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs) offer strong potential for AI-based dementia
diagnosis, their integration into federated learning (FL) systems remains
underexplored. In this benchmarking study, we systematically evaluate the
impact of key design choices: classification head architecture, fine-tuning
strategy, and aggregation method, on the performance and efficiency of
federated FM tuning using brain MRI data. Using a large multi-cohort dataset,
we find that the architecture of the classification head substantially
influences performance, freezing the FM encoder achieves comparable results to
full fine-tuning, and advanced aggregation methods outperform standard
federated averaging. Our results offer practical insights for deploying FMs in
decentralized clinical settings and highlight trade-offs that should guide
future method development.

TL;DR: 提出Multi-Method Ensemble (MME)评分方法，通过结合特征截断和多种评分函数来提升OOD检测性能，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法要么只关注单一技术（特征截断或评分函数），要么只在特定类型OOD数据集上评估，忽略了组合多种现有解决方案的潜力。

Method: 提出MME评分方法，统一了最先进的OOD检测器，结合特征截断技术和多种评分函数的聚合。

Result: 在大型和小型基准测试中（包括近OOD和远OOD场景），MME显著优于现有方法。使用BiT模型在ImageNet-1K基准上达到27.57%的平均FPR95，比最佳基线提升6%。

Conclusion: 理论和实证表明，最先进的特征截断和评分函数可以有效结合，多种评分函数的聚合能增强对各种OOD样本的鲁棒性，MME方法为OOD检测提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks
operating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications.
Existing methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques:
feature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID)
and OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish
between ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single
family of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD
dataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions.
Motivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate
that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be
effectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring
functions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on
these insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies
state-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function.
Extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering
near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model,
our method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K
benchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.

Conclusion: 局部增强方法通过减少背景干扰，能够更有效地提升对抗攻击的性能，为遥感图像目标检测的安全性提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily
rely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to
misclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can
improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive
augmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce
unnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection
model. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but
rather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper
proposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the
target regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing
background interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more
directly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby
improving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success
rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了ELV-Halluc基准，首次专门针对长视频幻觉问题，系统研究了语义聚合幻觉(SAH)，发现SAH随语义复杂度增加而增加，并通过位置编码策略和DPO训练显著减少了27.7%的SAH比例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面取得显著进展，但仍容易产生与视频输入不一致或无关的幻觉内容。现有基准主要关注短视频，且将幻觉归因于语言先验、缺失帧或视觉编码器引入的偏差，但这些原因过于简化，忽略了模型在将帧级语义聚合为事件级语义组时产生的语义聚合幻觉(SAH)。

Method: 提出了ELV-Halluc基准，专门用于长视频幻觉研究；通过实验验证SAH的存在及其与语义复杂度的关系；探讨了位置编码策略和DPO（直接偏好优化）策略来缓解SAH；构建了包含8K对抗数据对的数据集。

Result: 实验证实了SAH的存在，并显示SAH随语义复杂度增加而增加；模型在快速变化的语义上更容易产生SAH；采用位置编码和DPO策略后，在ELV-Halluc和Video-MME基准上均取得改进，SAH比例大幅减少27.7%。

Conclusion: 语义聚合幻觉(SAH)是长视频理解中的重要问题，需要专门的研究和缓解策略；位置编码和DPO训练是有效的缓解方法；ELV-Halluc基准为系统研究长视频幻觉提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to
hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.
Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They
attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing
frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these
causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still
oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect
outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of
hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during
the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic
groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to
increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to
separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.
To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark
dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of
SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases
with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to
SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to
mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to
alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability
to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a
dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both
ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

TL;DR: 提出一种卷积神经网络上采样器，用于提升基础模型特征的分辨率，以解决显微镜图像中细微特征和大尺寸图像的分割问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于patch的基础模型特征在显微镜图像分析中存在两个主要问题：1) 难以表示微图像中的细微特征；2) 难以处理材料和生物图像中的大尺寸图像。

Method: 训练一个卷积神经网络，参考输入图像对低分辨率（大patch尺寸）的基础模型特征进行上采样，无需额外训练即可应用于各种显微镜图像的特征化和分割。

Result: 上采样后的丰富特征能够分离难以分割的相（如发丝裂纹），交互式分割使用这些深度特征能够以更少的标签和更快的速度产生高质量的分割结果。

Conclusion: 该方法为显微镜图像分析提供了一种高效的特征上采样解决方案，显著提升了分割质量和工作效率，优于传统的卷积网络训练或微调方法。

Abstract: Feature foundation models - usually vision transformers - offer rich semantic
descriptors of images, useful for downstream tasks such as (interactive)
segmentation and object detection. For computational efficiency these
descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine
features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image
sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we
train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large
patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We
apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently
featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant
cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of
these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like
hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep
features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer
labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.

Motivation: 无人机场景中宽视野和复杂组合语义给视觉语言理解带来挑战，现有VLM模型缺乏细粒度语义，分层方法依赖精确实体分割，在动态环境中效果有限。

Method: HCCM框架包含两个组件：1）RG-ITC区域-全局图像文本对比学习，避免精确场景分割；2）RG-ITM区域-全局图像文本匹配，评估局部语义一致性。还引入MCD机制提升鲁棒性。

Result: 在GeoText-1652数据集上达到28.8%（图像检索）和14.7%（文本检索）的Recall@1。在未见过的ERA数据集上实现39.93%的平均召回率，优于微调基线。

Conclusion: HCCM框架有效解决了无人机场景中的视觉语言理解挑战，在细粒度语义捕捉和零样本泛化方面表现出色，为自然语言引导的无人机应用提供了有力解决方案。

Abstract: Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such
as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex
compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language
understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global
alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical
methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting
effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the
Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)
framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive
Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures
hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with
global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),
which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic
consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional
reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous,
destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation
(MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM
achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text
retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned
baselines.

Conclusion: 通过生成式方法和自监督学习，成功解决了从单张图像重建完整3D场景的挑战，特别是处理遮挡区域和多重可能性的问题

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

Conclusion: 结合CLIP先验知识和不确定性感知采样，为成对排序提供了高效可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal
classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved
reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of
annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden
(O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting
algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering
items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model
hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human
comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a
CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,
and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation
was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical
image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It
showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to
exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =
100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results
demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling
yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

Abstract: Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a
largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of
wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much
information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists
tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object
interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to
recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such
minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a
unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion,
object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input
configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space,
enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based
inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame
position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not
offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI
reconstruction.

Abstract: Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial

fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct
such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of
street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while
VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our
synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially
for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study
introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates
synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose
models to specialized domains.

TL;DR: TFM是一个统一的生成式轨迹方法，用于4D医学图像预测，通过学习底层时间分布，支持3D体积、多先验扫描和不规则采样，在三个公共纵向数据集上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中的时间动态理解对疾病进展建模、治疗计划和解剖发育追踪至关重要，但现有深度学习方法大多只考虑单一时间背景或专注于分类回归任务，缺乏细粒度空间预测能力。

Method: 提出Temporal Flow Matching (TFM)方法，这是一个统一的生成式轨迹方法，能够学习底层时间分布，支持3D体积、多先验扫描和不规则采样，并能回退到最近图像预测器作为特例。

Result: 在三个公共纵向数据集上的广泛基准测试表明，TFM一致超越了自然影像中的时空方法，为4D医学图像预测建立了新的最先进和鲁棒的基线。

Conclusion: TFM填补了医学影像时间动态建模的重要空白，提供了一个强大且灵活的框架，能够处理复杂的4D医学图像预测任务，并在多个数据集上展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for
applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and
anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either
consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification
or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions.
While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single
timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address
this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified
generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal
distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e.
predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports
$3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive
benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently
surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new
state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了多模态深度学习模型在清晶细胃肾细胃瘟夏的复发风险预测中的应用，通过整合本前CT和本后病理全手片图像来提高预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前广泛使用的Leibovich评分在远处复发风险分层方面有限，缺乏病人级别分辨率且排除了形态学信息，需要更准确的个急化预测方法。

Method: 采用模块化深度学习框架，结合预训练编码器和Cox生存分析模型，测试了单模态、后期融合和中间融合等不同策略。

Result: 病理WSI基础模型持续超过CT单模态，中间融合策略进一步提升性能，最佳模型接近调整后的Leibovich评分。形态学通过融合添加了价值。

Conclusion: 证明了基础模型基于多模态整合进行个急化ccRCC风险预测的可行性，未来需要探索更表达力强的融合策略和更大的多模态数据集。

Abstract: Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is
essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich
score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers
limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study
evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed
tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A
modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival
modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion
setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently
outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology.
Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model
(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random
tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models,
suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using
simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal
integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore
more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and
general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种深度展开网络(DUN)，通过模块化设计解决计算机全息重建中的几个关键挑战，包括物理关系忽视、感受野限制和距离限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机全息重建存在三个主要问题：端到端网络忽视物理关系、CNN算法感受野有限无法捕捉全局依赖、ASM基方法受限于近场范围。需要提高重建的准确性、稳定性和解释性。

Method: 提出深度展开网络(DUN)，将梯度下降分解为两个模块：适应带宽保持模型(ABPM)和相位域复数去噪器(PCD)。ABPM支持更宽的工作距离，PCD利用复数变形自注意力模块捕捉全局特征。

Result: 在模拟和实际数据上达到了独创性能，PSNR超过35dB，显示出超过现有方法的效果。

Conclusion: 该方法通过模块化设计有效解决了计算机全息重建中的多个挑战，提高了重建质量和系统灵活性，为深度学习基于物理的全息重建提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) has gained wide attention with deep
learning-based algorithms. However, due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature,
challenges remain in achieving accurate and stable reconstruction.
Specifically, ($i$) the widely used end-to-end networks treat the
reconstruction model as a black box, ignoring underlying physical
relationships, which reduces interpretability and flexibility. ($ii$) CNN-based
CGH algorithms have limited receptive fields, hindering their ability to
capture long-range dependencies and global context. ($iii$) Angular spectrum
method (ASM)-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.In this paper,
we propose a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into
two modules: an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain
complex-valued denoiser (PCD), providing more flexibility. ABPM allows for
wider working distances compared to ASM-based methods. At the same time, PCD
leverages its complex-valued deformable self-attention module to capture global
features and enhance performance, achieving a PSNR over 35 dB. Experiments on
simulated and real data show state-of-the-art results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然全自动分割方法已有显著进展，但临床实践需要保持人在回路中的方法来高效精炼预测掩码。autoPET/CT IV挑战赛通过引入基于模拟用户提示的交互分割任务来满足这一需求。

Method: 在autoPET III nnU-Net获胜管道基础上扩展框架，将用户提供的前景和背景点击编码为额外输入通道。系统研究空间提示表示，证明欧几里得距离变换(EDT)编码始终优于高斯核。提出在线模拟用户交互和自定义点采样策略以提高鲁棒性。

Result: 基于EDT的集成模型（使用和不使用外部数据训练）实现了最强的交叉验证性能，与基线模型相比减少了假阳性和假阴性。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了可提示模型在多示踪剂、多中心PET/CT中实现高效用户引导分割工作流程的潜力。

Abstract: Whole-body PET/CT is a cornerstone of oncological imaging, yet accurate
lesion segmentation remains challenging due to tracer heterogeneity,
physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. While fully automated
methods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches
that keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The
autoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive
segmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present
our submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,
we extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided
foreground and background clicks as additional input channels. We
systematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate
that Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform
Gaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user
interactions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under
realistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with
and without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance,
reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.
These results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient,
user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HD地图构建方法使用标准映射技术存在泛化问题，容易产生虚假道路元素，需要更精确的投影机制

Method: 基于相机参数的几何映射，采用概率投影机制和置信度分数来细化映射并过滤无关元素，改进时间处理

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse2数据集上表现优于最先进方法，特别是在长感知范围任务中改进显著

Conclusion: 提出的概率投影方法能有效提高HD地图构建的准确性和泛化性能，特别是在挑战性场景中

Abstract: Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately
mapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.
The precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final
vectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to
standard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these
methods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often
hallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a
geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to
extract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we
propose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to
(i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out
irrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition,
we improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively
accumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the
nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over
state-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements
are particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception
range. Our code and model checkpoints are available at

Motivation: 传统OCR技术存在字符分割错误问题，而现代单词级OCR将粘性转移到了单词分割。研究者识别到需要进一步迈向行级OCR来突破这一粘性。

Method: 提出了一种从单词级到行级OCR的自然进化方法，直接将整行文本作为输入，避免单词检测错误，并提供更大的语言上下文。

Result: 实验结果显示端到端准确性提高了5.4%，效率提高了4倍，证明了行级OCR的优势。还创建了包含251个英语页面图像的行级注释数据集。

Conclusion: 行级OCR方法不仅显著提高了准确性和效率，而且为利用大语言模型的发展提供了潜力，是文档图像识别领域的重要进步。

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each
character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character
segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in
sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first
detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly
output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of
language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe
that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word
segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical
progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to
bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for
better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not
only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough
literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark
such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a
meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level
annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy
improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning
towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4
times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With
continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds
potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:

TL;DR: FLORA是一种轻量级合成数据生成方法，使用LoRA微调Flux 1.1扩散模型，仅需消费级GPU和500张合成图像就能在目标检测任务中超越需要5000张图像和V100 GPU的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型数据增强方法计算资源需求高、需要企业级GPU和数千张合成图像的问题，使合成数据生成更加实用和易于获取。

Method: 使用Flux 1.1 Dev扩散模型，通过低秩适应（LoRA）进行微调，大幅降低计算需求，可在消费级GPU上生成合成数据集。

Result: 在7个不同目标检测数据集上验证，仅用500张合成图像训练的检测器性能优于使用5000张合成图像的ODGEN基线，mAP@.50:.95提升高达21.3%。

Conclusion: FLORA证明了质量和效率导向的方法比暴力生成更有效，仅用10%的数据和少量计算成本就能达到最先进性能，使高级合成数据生成更加实用和易于获取。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated
significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks.
Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of
large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA
V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we
propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation
pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned
exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces
computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a
consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our
approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate
that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our
approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on
5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to
21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass
state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves
superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational
cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is
more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data
creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 现有对抗性攻击检测方法需要昂贵的重新训练、修改网络架构或降低干净输入的模型性能，需要一种无需修改模型即可实时检测对抗性输入的方法。

Method: 通过在VGG-16上并行监测激活熵，发现对抗性输入在早期卷积层中使激活熵产生7%的偏移，利用这一特征进行检测。

Result: 实现了90%的检测准确率，误报率和漏报率均低于20%，干净输入和对抗性输入的熵分布完全分离。

Conclusion: CNN的可靠性可以通过激活熵单独评估，这为部署能够实时检测对抗性输入的自诊断视觉系统提供了实用方法，且不影响原始模型性能。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern
computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image
recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they
remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input
modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However,
existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network
architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that
adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in
CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using
parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs
consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers,
enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates
below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy
distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their
activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed
through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of
self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time
without compromising original model performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue,
however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital
Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving
clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in
head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by
these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data
generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks
involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and
high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled
synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present
DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images
designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.
Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein
Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with
CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL
showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This
demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the
robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated
challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as
open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the
community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

Abstract: Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims
to detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite
recent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most
approaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic
correspondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the
presence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to
positive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single
visible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key
contributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates
silence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being
more robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model,
SSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other
self-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval.
Second, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment
and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative
audio-visual pairs. Third, we present IS3+, an extended and improved version of
the IS3 synthetic dataset with negative audio.

Abstract: GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is
an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid
advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their
powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However,
building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of
operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the
limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we
introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents,
featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron
highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive
infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development.
It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to
enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment
connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised
finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and
then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex
reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves
superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning.
In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier
Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities
even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one
million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps,
and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental
results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app
scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有域泛化评估对基础模型如CLIP可能不够挑战性，因为网络规模预训练数据可能已经覆盖了许多基准测试。需要更好地评估CLIP在真实未见数据场景下的性能

Method: CLIP-DCA方法：1）使用单独领域头识别和增强CLIP编码器中的领域感知；2）通过合成生成多样化领域数据；3）鼓励领域特征与分类的分离以实现领域不变分类

Result: CLIP-DCA在更具挑战性的评估中相比现有方法显示出显著改进，特别是在更OOD的数据集上表现更好

Conclusion: 增强领域感知是基础模型中有效领域不变分类的前提条件，CLIP-DCA通过分离领域感知和分类特征成功提升了域泛化性能

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is
challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing
benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently
challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better
assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP
encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating
on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after
fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'
some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance
deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present
CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware
representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while
standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,
this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of
domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead
hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective
domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and
enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head
and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages
domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain
features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging
evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more
OOD.

Result: 实验表明，使用非典型数据的方法在各种设置下都能持续提升性能。增加非典型样本的类别多样性可进一步提升OOD检测性能；在新类别发现任务中，使用较小但语义更多样的非典型样本集比使用更大但更典型的数据集效果更好；在零样本动作识别中，非典型视频的语义多样性有助于模型更好地泛化到未见过的动作类别。

Conclusion: 非典型视频对开放世界中的视觉表示学习具有显著益处，新提出的数据集和发现鼓励该方向的进一步研究。

Abstract: Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the
open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing
studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets,
open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are
interested in asking: \textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in
the learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting
of various types of unusual atypical data (\eg sci-fi, animation, \etc). To
study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into
the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key
tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel
category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found
that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently
improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that
increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD
detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more
semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance
compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the
semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to
unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental
evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation
learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,
encouraging further studies in this direction.

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where
neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of
tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the
under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos
represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in
many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in
unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised
continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,
while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we
study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more
challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of
processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark
experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured
video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised
video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of
the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task
data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture
new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of
transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge
transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology
substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning
many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action
recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,
without using any labels or class boundaries.

TL;DR: 基于nnU-Net框架，采用多阶段级联预训练策略，通过数据增强和模型集成方法，在胰腺导管腺癌MRI分割挑战中取得了优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺导管腺癌MRI自动分割面临肿瘤组织对比度差和标注数据稀缺的挑战，需要开发在有限数据下高性能的专门化模型

Method: 使用nnU-Net框架，采用从通用解剖基础模型开始，依次在CT胰腺病变数据集和目标MRI模态上微调的多阶段级联预训练策略，并通过五折交叉验证系统评估数据增强方案和训练计划

Result: 发现数据增强存在关键权衡：激进增强获得最高体积精度，默认增强获得最佳边界精度（Task 1达到最先进的MASD 5.46mm和HD95 17.33mm）。最终提交使用定制异构集成策略，Task 1和Task 2的肿瘤Dice分数分别达到0.661和0.523

Conclusion: 提出了一种在有限数据和复杂医学成像任务背景下开发专门化高性能模型的稳健方法，通过度量感知集成策略有效提升了分割性能

Abstract: Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is
critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast
and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the
PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and
therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the
nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training
strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially
fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities.
Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data
augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical
trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric
accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision
(achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1).
For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom,
heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of
experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective,
achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523
for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized,
high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical
imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现优异，在多项选择题测试中准确率达92.8%，显著超越GPT-4和GPT-3.5，在真实病例治疗建议生成中也表现出良好的正确性和完整性，但需要专家监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估GPT-5在临床决策支持，特别是放射肿瘤学领域的性能表现，验证其作为临床辅助工具的可行性。

Method: 使用两个基准测试：ACR放射肿瘤学培训考试（300道选择题）和60个真实放射肿瘤病例情景。四位认证放射肿瘤学家评估治疗建议的正确性、完整性和幻觉情况。

Result: GPT-5在选择题测试中准确率92.8%，显著优于GPT-4（78.8%）和GPT-3.5（62.1%）。在病例评估中，正确性评分3.24/4，完整性评分3.59/4，幻觉罕见。

Conclusion: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现优异，但仍有改进空间，生成的建议需要专家严格监督才能临床使用。

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in
clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been
specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the
ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300
multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation
oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment
indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate
concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated
correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was
quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,
outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were
most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's
treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%
CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).
Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their
presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for
correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors
clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed
clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation
oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable
performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment
recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.
While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors
underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert
oversight before clinical implementation.

Motivation: 现有异常检测方法主要依赖精心设计的图像特征提取器和记忆库来捕捉对象间的逻辑关系，但在逻辑异常检测方面存在局限，且正常数据量有限。

Method: 构建三个互补的记忆库：1）类级文本记忆库用于逻辑异常检测；2）对象级图像记忆库保持完整对象轮廓；3）补丁级记忆库用于结构异常检测。通过多级检索和比较计算异常分数并融合。

Result: 在7个公开数据集（工业和医疗领域）上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过协作记忆库统一结构和逻辑异常检测的TMUAD框架有效提升了异常检测能力，模型和代码已开源。

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal
patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available.
Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image
feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between
objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical
anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified
structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level
text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text
extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input
images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves
complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,
we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for
constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These
three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images
that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple
levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and
logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving
industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at
https://github.com/SIA-IDE/TMUAD.

Abstract: Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks
and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding.
In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video
and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a
spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such
our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object
segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since
obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate
an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions.
We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the
object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an
unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We
call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a
SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model
yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object
segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and
establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made
available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/vocap.

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims
to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events
and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model
must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify
the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),
and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).
Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we
show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address
the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories
may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key
contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb
classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous
semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of
fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to
reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning
(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a
comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully
designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To
address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb
Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to
capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision
boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach
achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on
traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

TL;DR: DriveQA是一个全面的开源文本和视觉基准测试，用于评估LLM和MLLM在驾驶知识测试中的表现，发现现有模型在数值推理、复杂路权场景等方面存在显著弱点，但通过微调和预训练可以显著提升性能。


<details>

Result: 现有模型在基本交通规则上表现良好，但在数值推理、复杂路权场景、交通标志变体和空间布局方面存在显著弱点。微调后模型在多个类别上准确率提升，特别是在监管标志识别和交叉口决策方面。

Conclusion: DriveQA基准测试为评估驾驶知识理解提供了全面框架，证明通过适当的训练，模型可以内化交通知识并在下游任务中有效泛化，对自动驾驶系统的发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today,
would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks
on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a
complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way
principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases
that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an
extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers
traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we
show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on
basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning
and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial
layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple
categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection
decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into
model sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective,
distance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances
downstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world
datasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can
internalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively
across downstream QA tasks.
