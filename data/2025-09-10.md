### [1] [CellPainTR: Generalizable Representation Learning for Cross-Dataset Cell Painting Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06986)
*Cedric Caruzzo,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CellPainTR是基于Transformer的架构，用于学习对批次效应鲁棒的细胞形态学基础表征，无需微调即可泛化到未见数据集，在JUMP数据集上优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模生物发现需要整合异构数据集，但技术批次效应和缺乏可泛化模型是主要障碍。

Method: 采用Transformer架构，设计源特定上下文标记，实现无需重新训练的有效分布外泛化。

Result: 在JUMP数据集上优于ComBat和Harmony等传统方法，在未见Bray数据集上保持高性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为创建真正的图像分析基础模型迈出重要一步，实现更可靠和可扩展的跨研究生物分析。

Abstract: Large-scale biological discovery requires integrating massive, heterogeneous
datasets like those from the JUMP Cell Painting consortium, but technical batch
effects and a lack of generalizable models remain critical roadblocks. To
address this, we introduce CellPainTR, a Transformer-based architecture
designed to learn foundational representations of cellular morphology that are
robust to batch effects. Unlike traditional methods that require retraining on
new data, CellPainTR's design, featuring source-specific context tokens, allows
for effective out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to entirely unseen
datasets without fine-tuning. We validate CellPainTR on the large-scale JUMP
dataset, where it outperforms established methods like ComBat and Harmony in
both batch integration and biological signal preservation. Critically, we
demonstrate its robustness through a challenging OOD task on the unseen Bray et
al. dataset, where it maintains high performance despite significant domain and
feature shifts. Our work represents a significant step towards creating truly
foundational models for image-based profiling, enabling more reliable and
scalable cross-study biological analysis.

### [2] [FusWay: Multimodal hybrid fusion approach. Application to Railway Defect Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06987)
*Alexey Zhukov,Jenny Benois-Pineau,Amira Youssef,Akka Zemmari,Mohamed Mosbah,Virginie Taillandier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于YOLOv8n和Vision Transformer的多模态融合架构，通过结合视觉和音频信息来提高铁路缺陷检测的精确度，实验结果显示比单一视觉方法提高0.2个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一视觉检测方法在铁路缺陷检测中存在过检测问题，当正常结构元件外观类似缺陷时容易出现误检。需要通过多模态融合来提高检测准确性。

Method: 构建了基于域规则的多模态融合架构，结合YOLOv8n进行快速物体检测，使用Vision Transformer结合从多个层（7、16、19）提取的特征图，并与合成音频表征进行融合。

Result: 在真实铁路数据集上评估，多模态融合方法比单一视觉方法提高了精度和总体准确性0.2个百分点，学生t检验证明了统计显著性。

Conclusion: 通过视觉与音频多模态融合可以有效提高铁路缺陷检测的性能，减少过检测现象，为工业检测应用提供了更加准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion is a multimedia technique that has become popular in the
wide range of tasks where image information is accompanied by a signal/audio.
The latter may not convey highly semantic information, such as speech or music,
but some measures such as audio signal recorded by mics in the goal to detect
rail structure elements or defects. While classical detection approaches such
as You Only Look Once (YOLO) family detectors can be efficiently deployed for
defect detection on the image modality, the single modality approaches remain
limited. They yield an overdetection in case of the appearance similar to
normal structural elements. The paper proposes a new multimodal fusion
architecture built on the basis of domain rules with YOLO and Vision
transformer backbones. It integrates YOLOv8n for rapid object detection with a
Vision Transformer (ViT) to combine feature maps extracted from multiple layers
(7, 16, and 19) and synthesised audio representations for two defect classes:
rail Rupture and Surface defect. Fusion is performed between audio and image.
Experimental evaluation on a real-world railway dataset demonstrates that our
multimodal fusion improves precision and overall accuracy by 0.2 points
compared to the vision-only approach. Student's unpaired t-test also confirms
statistical significance of differences in the mean accuracy.

### [3] [Frustratingly Easy Feature Reconstruction for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06988)
*Yingsheng Wang,Shuo Lu,Jian Liang,Aihua Zheng,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练数据的后处理方法ClaFR，通过分类器权重正交分解提取类已知子空间，计算特征重构误差来进行OOD检测，在多个基准测试中达到领先性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于特征的后处理OOD检测方法通常需要访问训练数据，这在数据隐私保护场景下不适用。需要开发不依赖训练数据的有效方法。

Method: ClaFR方法：1）对分类器权重进行正交分解提取类已知子空间；2）将原始特征映射到该子空间获得新表示；3）计算子空间内的特征重构误差作为OOD分数。

Result: 在多个OOD基准测试中取得了领先性能，且不需要访问训练数据。

Conclusion: ClaFR是一种简单有效的后处理OOD检测方法，通过子空间投影和特征重构误差计算，在不依赖训练数据的情况下实现了优异的检测性能。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection helps models identify data outside the
training categories, crucial for security applications. While feature-based
post-hoc methods address this by evaluating data differences in the feature
space without changing network parameters, they often require access to
training data, which may not be suitable for some data privacy scenarios. This
may not be suitable in scenarios where data privacy protection is a concern. In
this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc method, termed
Classifier-based Feature Reconstruction (ClaFR), from the perspective of
subspace projection. It first performs an orthogonal decomposition of the
classifier's weights to extract the class-known subspace, then maps the
original data features into this subspace to obtain new data representations.
Subsequently, the OOD score is determined by calculating the feature
reconstruction error of the data within the subspace. Compared to existing OOD
detection algorithms, our method does not require access to training data while
achieving leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks. Our code is released
at https://github.com/Aie0923/ClaFR.

### [4] [DIET-CP: Lightweight and Data Efficient Self Supervised Continued Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06990)
*Bryan Rodas,Natalie Montesino,Jakob Ambsdorf,David Klindt,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIET-CP是一种简单的持续预训练策略，可以让基础模型适应新的数据分布，只需要少量数据且无需标签，性能显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专业领域数据集往往很小，限制了SSL方法的应用，且预训练模型通常只发布权重，缺乏继续预训练的重要信息

Method: 基于简单目标函数的持续预训练策略，无需标签，不引入比监督微调更多的超参数

Result: 在不同数据模态和骨干网络选择下表现稳定，仅用1000张图像就能显著提升DINOv3等最先进模型的性能

Conclusion: DIET-CP为小规模专业领域数据集的持续预训练提供了简单有效的解决方案

Abstract: Continued pretraining offers a promising solution for adapting foundation
models to a new target domain. However, in specialized domains, available
datasets are often very small, limiting the applicability of SSL methods
developed for large-scale pretraining and making hyperparameter search
infeasible. In addition, pretrained models are usually released as
backbone-weights only, lacking important information to continue pretraining.
We propose to bridge this gap with DIET-CP, a simple continued pretraining
strategy, where any strong foundation model can be steered towards the new data
distribution of interest. DIET-CP relies on a very simple objective, requires
no labels, and introduces no more hyperparameters than supervised finetuning.
It is stable across data modalities and backbone choices, while providing a
significant performance boost for state-of-the-art models such as DINOv3 using
only 1000 images.

### [5] [FedAPT: Federated Adversarial Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06992)
*Kun Zhai,Siheng Chen,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedAPT是一种增强联邦提示调优对抗鲁棒性的新方法，通过类别感知提示生成器和跨层生成器共享策略解决非IID设置下的类别信息差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦提示调优(FPT)方法在面对对抗攻击时容易导致下游任务错误分类，特别是在非独立同分布(non-IID)设置下存在客户端与全局模型之间的类别信息差距问题。

Method: 提出类别感知提示生成器，利用全局标签嵌入作为引导生成视觉提示；采用跨层生成器共享策略增强不同模型层间的提示耦合。

Result: 在多个图像分类数据集上的实验表明，FedAPT在提升对抗鲁棒性方面显著优于现有方法，并在跨域和跨数据集场景中展现出优异的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FedAPT有效解决了联邦提示调优中的对抗鲁棒性问题，具有实际应用价值，特别是在非IID设置下的联邦学习场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Federated Prompt Tuning (FPT) is an efficient method for cross-client
collaborative fine-tuning of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However,
models tuned using FPT are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to
misclassification in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce Federated
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (\textbf{FedAPT}), a novel method designed to enhance
the adversarial robustness of FPT. We identify a key issue in FedAPT under
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings: a \textit{class
information gap} between clients and the global model. Clients rely solely on
limited local label information to generate adversarial samples for training,
while the global model must defend against adversarial attacks from global
labels. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{class-aware prompt
generator} that generates visual prompts from text prompts. This generator is
guided by a \emph{Global Label Embedding} (serving as a ``beacon") which
encodes cross-client label information to create more globally-aligned visual
prompts. Additionally, we propose a \textbf{cross-layer generator sharing}
strategy to enhance prompt coupling across different layers of the model,
further boosting adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple
image classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedAPT in
improving adversarial robustness, outperforming existing methods by a large
margin. FedAPT also exhibits exceptional generalization in cross-domain and
cross-dataset scenarios, indicating its effectiveness in real-world
applications.

### [7] [VLMs-in-the-Wild: Bridging the Gap Between Academic Benchmarks and Enterprise Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06994)
*Srihari Bandraupalli,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViLD框架填补了学术评估与企业部署需求之间的差距，通过10个关键业务任务和创新的BlockWeaver算法，在真实数据集上评估开源视觉语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于选择题和合成数据的基准测试无法反映企业实际应用需求，需要建立更贴近真实业务场景的评估框架。

Method: 提出ViLD框架，定义10个业务关键任务，开发BlockWeaver算法处理无序OCR输出比较，构建包含7500个真实样本的基准数据集，结合语义匹配和传统指标进行评估。

Result: 在Qwen、MIMO和InternVL等开源VLM上进行了行业基准测试，提供了首个基于企业需求的VLM能力评估。

Conclusion: ViLD框架为企业在实际环境中部署视觉语言模型提供了可操作的见解和可靠的评估标准。

Abstract: Open-source Vision-Language Models show immense promise for enterprise
applications, yet a critical disconnect exists between academic evaluation and
enterprise deployment requirements. Current benchmarks rely heavily on
multiple-choice questions and synthetic data, failing to capture the complexity
of real-world business applications like social media content analysis. This
paper introduces VLM-in-the-Wild (ViLD), a comprehensive framework to bridge
this gap by evaluating VLMs on operational enterprise requirements. We define
ten business-critical tasks: logo detection, OCR, object detection, human
presence and demographic analysis, human activity and appearance analysis,
scene detection, camera perspective and media quality assessment, dominant
colors, comprehensive description, and NSFW detection. To this framework, we
bring an innovative BlockWeaver Algorithm that solves the challenging problem
of comparing unordered, variably-grouped OCR outputs from VLMs without relying
on embeddings or LLMs, achieving remarkable speed and reliability. To
demonstrate efficacy of ViLD, we constructed a new benchmark dataset of 7,500
diverse samples, carefully stratified from a corpus of one million real-world
images and videos. ViLD provides actionable insights by combining semantic
matching (both embedding-based and LLM-as-a-judge approaches), traditional
metrics, and novel methods to measure the completeness and faithfulness of
descriptive outputs. By benchmarking leading open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, and
InternVL) against a powerful proprietary baseline as per ViLD framework, we
provide one of the first industry-grounded, task-driven assessment of VLMs
capabilities, offering actionable insights for their deployment in enterprise
environments.

### [8] [The Protocol Genome A Self Supervised Learning Framework from DICOM Headers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06995)
*Jimmy Joseph*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Protocol Genome是一个自监督学习系统，通过分析DICOM头部信息学习协议相关性，在外部验证中达到AUROC 0.901（基线0.847）和ECE 0.036（基线0.058），提高了跨模态和厂商的校准性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床影像通过PACS/DICOM系统处理，扫描协议选择（扫描仪型号、序列、参数等）会影响对比度、噪声和伪影，这些潜在混杂因素阻碍了纯图像网络在不同站点间的泛化能力。

Method: 将结构化DICOM头部作为标签，通过三种方式学习协议感知但临床鲁棒的图像表示：(1)协议-图像对比学习，(2)掩码协议预测，(3)协议-协议转换。使用126万项研究数据（7个医疗系统，31台扫描仪，3个厂商）。

Result: 在三个临床任务上表现优异：肺栓塞胸部CT分诊（+0.046 AUROC）、脑胶质瘤MRI分级（+0.058 AUROC）、心胸比异常X光检测（+0.041 AUROC），获得25-37%的校准改进（p < 0.01）。使用10-20%标注数据仍能保持优势。

Conclusion: Protocol Genome通过整合DICOM协议信息显著提高了医学影像AI模型的泛化能力和校准性，减少了协议边界处的假阳性，具有临床实用性，并提供了完整的模型部署指南和偏差审计。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Protocol Genome, a self-supervised learning
system that learns correlations from DICOM headers and achieves AUROC 0.901 (vs
0.847 baseline) and ECE 0.036 (vs 0.058) on fully held-out external validation.
Our method also improves calibration and robustness across modalities (CT, MRI,
CXR) and vendors. Clinical imaging is funneled through PACS/DICOM, where
procedure choices (scanner make/model, sequence, kernel, kVp, TR/TE, and slice
thickness) have consequences for contrast, noise, and artifact. These latent
confounders impede the generalization of image-only networks across sites. We
consider structured DICOM headers as a label and learn protocol-aware but
clinically robust image representations. Protocol Genome obtains tokenized
embeddings of de-identified header fields and models them along with image
features using: (1) protocol-image contrastive learning, (2) masked protocol
prediction, and (3) protocol-protocol translation. With 1.26M studies (7 health
systems, 31 scanners, 3 vendors; CT, MR, CR/DR), we experiment on: (A) chest CT
triage for PE, (B) brain MRI glioma grading, and (C) chest radiograph
cardiomegaly detection. Relative to strong SSL baselines (SimCLR, MAE) as well
as ImageNet transfer, Protocol Genome (+0.046: PE, +0.058: glioma, +0.041:
cardiomegaly) is associated with higher external AUROC; 25-37% calibration
improvements are obtained (p < 0.01, DeLong tests). While the gains may be
task-dependent, they are preserved with 10-20% of labeled data. From a clinical
point of view, the technique reduces false positives at protocol borders and is
applicable in a PACS (DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE, DICOMweb QIDO/WADO). We publish a
model card and deployment guide, complete with both de-identification and bias
audits.

*Jie Zhang,Ting Xu,Gelei Deng,Runyi Hu,Han Qiu,Tianwei Zhang,Qing Guo,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现先进视觉语言模型在识别碎片化、融合或部分遮挡的文字时表现远不如人类，存在结构性局限，缺乏对符号组合性的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类在文字识别方面展现出的强大适应性与视觉语言模型在这方面的表现差异，探索模型在非标准文字条件下的鲁棒性。

Method: 构建两个心理物理学启发的基准测试，分别针对中文象形文字和英文字母文字，通过分割、重组和叠加字形来创建对模型具有挑战性但仍可被人识别的刺激材料。

Result: 尽管在标准文本上表现良好，但当代视觉语言模型在这些扰动条件下表现严重下降，经常产生无关或不连贯的输出。

Conclusion: 模型过度依赖通用视觉不变性而忽视了组合性先验知识，需要开发能够编码符号分割、组合和绑定的架构和训练策略。

Abstract: Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic
communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words
even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper
investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this
resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct
writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing,
recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli
for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on
clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations,
frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a
structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but
under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release
stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate
transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures
and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and
binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying
multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and
security.

*Guan Yu,Zhang Jianhua,Liang Dong,Liu Qiegen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种在频域进行特征级学习的动态心脏MRI重建方法，通过时间融合策略合成k空间数据，在低数据条件下表现出强大的生成能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏磁共振成像具有动态复杂特性，高质量多样化的k空间数据在实践中难以获得，这阻碍了动态心脏MRI的鲁棒重建

Method: 在频域进行特征级学习，利用傅里叶变换的全局表示能力，采用时间融合策略整合跨时间帧的k空间数据来指导生成过程

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在低数据条件下具有强大的生成能力

Conclusion: 该方法具有缓解动态MRI重建中数据稀缺问题的实际潜力

Abstract: Owing to the inherently dynamic and complex characteristics of cardiac
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, high-quality and diverse k-space data are
rarely available in practice, which in turn hampers robust reconstruction of
dynamic cardiac MRI. To address this challenge, we perform feature-level
learning directly in the frequency domain and employ a temporal-fusion strategy
as the generative guidance to synthesize k-space data. Specifically, leveraging
the global representation capacity of the Fourier transform, the frequency
domain can be considered a natural global feature space. Therefore, unlike
traditional methods that use pixel-level convolution for feature learning and
modeling in the image domain, this letter focuses on feature-level modeling in
the frequency domain, enabling stable and rich generation even with ultra
low-data regimes. Moreover, leveraging the advantages of feature-level modeling
in the frequency domain, we integrate k-space data across time frames with
multiple fusion strategies to steer and further optimize the generative
trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses
strong generative ability in low-data regimes, indicating practical potential
to alleviate data scarcity in dynamic MRI reconstruction.

*Liviu Nicolae Fircă,Antonio Bărbălau,Dan Oneata,Elena Burceanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文首次明确评估模型在语义和感知上差异较大的类别间进行属性预测的稳健性，发现模型性能随着训练测试集相关性减弱而冲击性下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估模型能否在语义和感知差异较大的类别间转移属性知识，演绎属性预测任务的稳健性和模型的抽象能力。

Method: 通过五种训练测试集分割策略（LLM语义分组、嵌入相似度阈值、嵌入聚类、超级类分割和随机分割）逐渐减少训练测试集相关性，测试模型在无关对象类型间转移属性知识的能力。

Result: 结果显示随着训练测试集相关性的降低，模型性能冲击性下降，其中聚类方法在减少隐藏相关性和保持可学习性方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 当前表示学习方法在属性推理任务中存在显著限制，对训练测试集分割设计敏感，需要更好的基准来评估模型的抽象能力。

Abstract: Can models generalize attribute knowledge across semantically and
perceptually dissimilar categories? While prior work has addressed attribute
prediction within narrow taxonomic or visually similar domains, it remains
unclear whether current models can abstract attributes and apply them to
conceptually distant categories. This work presents the first explicit
evaluation for the robustness of the attribute prediction task under such
conditions, testing whether models can correctly infer shared attributes
between unrelated object types: e.g., identifying that the attribute "has four
legs" is common to both "dogs" and "chairs". To enable this evaluation, we
introduce train-test split strategies that progressively reduce correlation
between training and test sets, based on: LLM-driven semantic grouping,
embedding similarity thresholding, embedding-based clustering, and
supercategory-based partitioning using ground-truth labels. Results show a
sharp drop in performance as the correlation between training and test
categories decreases, indicating strong sensitivity to split design. Among the
evaluated methods, clustering yields the most effective trade-off, reducing
hidden correlations while preserving learnability. These findings offer new
insights into the limitations of current representations and inform future
benchmark construction for attribute reasoning.

### [12] [Human-in-the-Loop: Quantitative Evaluation of 3D Models Generation by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07010)
*Ahmed R. Sadik,Mariusz Bujny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于人在循环的量化评估框架，用于评估大语言模型生成的3D模型的几何和结构保真度，通过综合性能指标对比真实CAD模型，显著提高了生成质量和收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型能够解释多模态输入生成复杂3D形状，但对几何和结构保真度的精确评估方法仍不充分，需要开发更稳健的评估方法来支持CAD设计民主化、反向工程和快速原型制造等应用。

Method: 提出了一套综合的相似性和复杂性指标，包括体积准确度、表面对齐度、尺寸保真度和拓扑复杂性，以L垂直极作为案例研究，系统比较了四种输入模态：2D正交视图、等质绘图、几何结构树和代码基于修正提示的性能。

Result: 研究发现随着语义丰富度的增加，生成保真度显著提高，代码级提示在所有指标上实现了完美重建。量化评估方法让模型更快速收敛到真实值，特别是相比传统仅依靠视觉检查和人类直觉的定性方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作不仅推进了对AI辅助形状合成的理解，还提供了一种可扩展的方法论来验证和精炼生成模型，为多样化的CAD应用提供支持。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly capable of interpreting multimodal
inputs to generate complex 3D shapes, yet robust methods to evaluate geometric
and structural fidelity remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces a human in
the loop framework for the quantitative evaluation of LLM generated 3D models,
supporting applications such as democratization of CAD design, reverse
engineering of legacy designs, and rapid prototyping. We propose a
comprehensive suite of similarity and complexity metrics, including volumetric
accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, and topological intricacy,
to benchmark generated models against ground truth CAD references. Using an L
bracket component as a case study, we systematically compare LLM performance
across four input modalities: 2D orthographic views, isometric sketches,
geometric structure trees, and code based correction prompts. Our findings
demonstrate improved generation fidelity with increased semantic richness, with
code level prompts achieving perfect reconstruction across all metrics. A key
contribution of this work is demonstrating that our proposed quantitative
evaluation approach enables significantly faster convergence toward the ground
truth, especially compared to traditional qualitative methods based solely on
visual inspection and human intuition. This work not only advances the
understanding of AI assisted shape synthesis but also provides a scalable
methodology to validate and refine generative models for diverse CAD
applications.

*Jiarui Chen,Yikeng Chen,Yingshuang Zou,Ye Huang,Peng Wang,Yuan Liu,Yujing Sun,Wenping Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEGS²是一个针对3D高斯泼溅技术的内存优化框架，通过联合优化基元数量和每个基元的参数，实现了前所未有的内存压缩，在保持渲染质量的同时显著降低了显存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术虽然在新视角合成中表现出色，但其高内存消耗严重限制了在边缘设备上的应用。现有压缩方法大多只关注存储压缩，未能解决渲染内存这一关键瓶颈。

Method: 1) 用轻量级的任意方向球面高斯瓣替代内存密集的球谐函数作为颜色表示；2) 提出统一的软剪枝框架，将基元数量和瓣数量剪枝建模为单一约束优化问题。

Result: 相比现有方法，MEGS²实现了50%的静态显存减少和40%的渲染显存减少，同时保持了相当的渲染质量。

Conclusion: MEGS²通过联合优化基元数量和参数表示，有效解决了3D高斯泼溅的内存瓶颈问题，为边缘设备部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a dominant novel-view synthesis
technique, but its high memory consumption severely limits its applicability on
edge devices. A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed
to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and
fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this
problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that
tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total
primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented
memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical
harmonics with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our
color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning
framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single
constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a
50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to
existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖的正则化损失函数，通过空间域矩正则化和频谱域功率谱正则化的组合，强制潜在空间样本符合标准高斯分布，提升文本到图像模型的下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯性正则化方法存在局限性，需要一种更有效的方法来确保文本到图像模型潜在空间的标准高斯性，以支持各种下游优化任务。

Method: 将高维样本元素视为一维标准高斯变量，结合空间域矩正则化和频谱域功率谱正则化，通过随机排列确保排列不变性，构建复合损失函数。

Result: 新正则化方法在生成建模中表现优异，能有效防止奖励攻击，加速收敛，在美学质量和文本对齐方面超越现有高斯性正则化方法。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架为高斯性正则化提供了更高效和全面的解决方案，在文本到图像模型的测试时奖励对齐任务中展现出显著优势。

Abstract: We propose a novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussianity,
encouraging samples to align with a standard Gaussian distribution. This
facilitates a range of downstream tasks involving optimization in the latent
space of text-to-image models. We treat elements of a high-dimensional sample
as one-dimensional standard Gaussian variables and define a composite loss that
combines moment-based regularization in the spatial domain with power
spectrum-based regularization in the spectral domain. Since the expected values
of moments and power spectrum distributions are analytically known, the loss
promotes conformity to these properties. To ensure permutation invariance, the
losses are applied to randomly permuted inputs. Notably, existing
Gaussianity-based regularizations fall within our unified framework: some
correspond to moment losses of specific orders, while the previous
covariance-matching loss is equivalent to our spectral loss but incurs higher
time complexity due to its spatial-domain computation. We showcase the
application of our regularization in generative modeling for test-time reward
alignment with a text-to-image model, specifically to enhance aesthetics and
text alignment. Our regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity
regularization, effectively prevents reward hacking and accelerates
convergence.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical task in microscopy, essential for accurately
analyzing and interpreting complex visual data. This task can be performed
using custom models trained on domain-specific datasets, transfer learning from
pre-trained models, or foundational models that offer broad applicability.
However, foundational models often present a considerable number of
non-transparent tuning parameters that require extensive manual optimization,
limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis. Here, we
introduce a reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models
and illustrate this approach for SAM (Segment Anything Model) framework by
Meta. The reward functions can be constructed to represent the physics of the
imaged system, including particle size distributions, geometries, and other
criteria. By integrating a reward-driven optimization framework, we enhance
SAM's adaptability and performance, leading to an optimized variant, SAM$^{*}$,
that better aligns with the requirements of diverse segmentation tasks and
particularly allows for real-time streaming data segmentation. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach in microscopy imaging, where precise
segmentation is crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces,
and nanoscale features.

performance, achieving a 73.1% accuracy rate, surpassing both traditional

*Juan Manuel Contreras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Aymara图像公平性评估基准，用于评估AI生成图像中的社会偏见，发现大型多模态模型会系统性放大职业性别刻板印象，存在默认男性偏见，且不同模型偏见程度差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究虽然识别了大型多模态模型中的性别偏见，但方法学限制阻碍了大规模、可比较的跨模型分析，需要开发标准化评估工具来促进AI开发的问责制和公平性。

Method: 使用13个商业可用的大型多模态模型，通过75个程序生成的性别中性提示词，生成刻板印象男性职业、刻板印象女性职业和非刻板印象职业的人物图像，然后使用经过验证的LLM-as-a-judge系统对965张生成图像进行性别代表性评分。

Result: 1) LMMs系统性放大职业性别刻板印象，在男性刻板印象职业中生成93.0%男性图像，女性刻板印象职业中仅22.5%男性图像；2) 模型存在强烈默认男性偏见，非刻板印象职业中68.3%生成男性；3) 不同模型偏见程度差异显著，男性代表性从46.7%到73.3%不等。

Conclusion: 研究提供了迄今为止最全面的跨模型性别偏见基准，强调高偏见并非不可避免的结果而是设计选择的结果，最佳表现模型能够去放大性别刻板印象并接近性别平等，突显标准化自动化评估工具对促进AI公平性的必要性。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation,
but they risk perpetuating the harmful social biases in their training data.
Prior work has identified gender bias in these models, but methodological
limitations prevented large-scale, comparable, cross-model analysis. To address
this gap, we introduce the Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation, a benchmark for
assessing social bias in AI-generated images. We test 13 commercially available
LMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people
in stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical
professions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965
resulting images for gender representation. Our results reveal (p < .001 for
all): 1) LMMs systematically not only reproduce but actually amplify
occupational gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, generating
men in 93.0% of images for male-stereotyped professions but only 22.5% for
female-stereotyped professions; 2) Models exhibit a strong default-male bias,
generating men in 68.3% of the time for non-stereotyped professions; and 3) The
extent of bias varies dramatically across models, with overall male
representation ranging from 46.7% to 73.3%. Notably, the top-performing model
de-amplified gender stereotypes and approached gender parity, achieving the
highest fairness scores. This variation suggests high bias is not an inevitable
outcome but a consequence of design choices. Our work provides the most
comprehensive cross-model benchmark of gender bias to date and underscores the
necessity of standardized, automated evaluation tools for promoting
accountability and fairness in AI development.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于块稀疏核的注意力机制替代方案，用于解决多视图重建中transformer模型的二次复杂度瓶颈问题，实现了4倍推理加速且保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的transformer-based多视图重建模型（如VGGT和π³）虽然效果出色，但由于全局注意力层的二次复杂度，在处理大规模图像集时存在运行时瓶颈。通过分析发现注意力矩阵的概率质量集中在少数与跨视图几何匹配对应的patch-patch交互上。

Method: 受结构化注意力和大语言模型最新进展的启发，提出使用高度优化的块稀疏核来替代密集的全局注意力操作。该方法无需重新训练主干网络，适用于VGGT和π³模型，并支持大规模图像集合。

Result: 在全面的多视图基准测试中，该方法实现了高达4倍的推理加速，同时保持了可比较的任务性能。

Conclusion: 提出的块稀疏注意力机制有效解决了多视图重建中transformer模型的扩展性问题，为处理大规模图像集提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate feed-forward multi-view reconstruction has long been
an important task in computer vision. Recent transformer-based models like VGGT
and $\pi^3$ have achieved impressive results with simple architectures, yet
they face an inherent runtime bottleneck, due to the quadratic complexity of
the global attention layers, that limits the scalability to large image sets.
In this paper, we empirically analyze the global attention matrix of these
models and observe that probability mass concentrates on a small subset of
patch-patch interactions that correspond to cross-view geometric matches.
Motivated by the structured attention and inspired by recent advancement in
large language models, we propose a replacement for the dense global attention
operation based on highly optimized block-sparse kernels, yielding up to
$4\times$ faster inference with comparable task performance. Our retrofit
requires no retraining of the backbone, extends to both VGGT and $\pi^3$, and
supports large image collections. Evaluations on a comprehensive suite of
multi-view benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VIO系统向边缘服务器卸载的趋势导致服务器端面临姿态欺骗威胁，微小的姿态欺骗可能累积成显著漂移，同时规避启发式检查，需要有效的检测和恢复机制。

Method: 提出无监督、无标签的检测和恢复机制，在无攻击会话上训练模型学习运动时序规律，检测运行时偏差并启动恢复以恢复姿态一致性。

Result: 在真实卸载VIO环境中使用ILLIXR测试床评估，跨多个欺骗强度实验结果显示，相比无防御基线，轨迹和姿态误差显著降低。

Conclusion: 该无监督检测恢复机制能有效应对VIO系统中的姿态欺骗威胁，显著提升系统安全性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) supports immersive Virtual Reality (VR) by
fusing camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data for real-time pose.
However, current trend of offloading VIO to edge servers can lead server-side
threat surface where subtle pose spoofing can accumulate into substantial
drift, while evading heuristic checks. In this paper, we study this threat and
present an unsupervised, label-free detection and recovery mechanism. The
proposed model is trained on attack-free sessions to learn temporal
regularities of motion to detect runtime deviations and initiate recovery to
restore pose consistency. We evaluate the approach in a realistic offloaded-VIO
environment using ILLIXR testbed across multiple spoofing intensities.
Experimental results in terms of well-known performance metrics show
substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error compared to a no-defense
baseline.

Motivation: 研究假设人脸增强技术在提升感知质量的同时会降低深度伪造检测器的性能，探讨这些技术是否可以作为反取证工具使用。

Method: 系统评估传统图像处理方法和基于GAN的增强技术对深度伪造检测器的影响，分析对Naïve、空间和频域检测方法的效果，并进行对抗训练实验。

Result: 实验显示基础增强滤波器可降低检测准确率达64.63%，GAN技术进一步利用这些漏洞，攻击成功率可达75.12%。

Conclusion: 人脸增强方法能有效作为反取证工具，强调需要开发更具弹性和适应性的取证方法。

Abstract: Face enhancement techniques are widely used to enhance facial appearance.
However, they can inadvertently distort biometric features, leading to
significant decrease in the accuracy of deepfake detectors. This study
hypothesizes that these techniques, while improving perceptual quality, can
degrade the performance of deepfake detectors. To investigate this, we
systematically evaluate whether commonly used face enhancement methods can
serve an anti-forensic role by reducing detection accuracy. We use both
traditional image processing methods and advanced GAN-based enhancements to
evaluate the robustness of deepfake detectors. We provide a comprehensive
analysis of the effectiveness of these enhancement techniques, focusing on
their impact on Na\"ive, Spatial, and Frequency-based detection methods.
Furthermore, we conduct adversarial training experiments to assess whether
exposure to face enhancement transformations improves model robustness.
Experiments conducted on the FaceForensics++, DeepFakeDetection, and CelebDF-v2
datasets indicate that even basic enhancement filters can significantly reduce
detection accuracy achieving ASR up to 64.63\%. In contrast, GAN-based
techniques further exploit these vulnerabilities, achieving ASR up to 75.12\%.
Our results demonstrate that face enhancement methods can effectively function
as anti-forensic tools, emphasizing the need for more resilient and adaptive
forensic methods.

Motivation: 监督学习需要大量标注数据，但在现实应用中，新类别可能随时出现。现有方法主要关注半监督学习，本文探索完全无监督的新类发现方法。

Method: 使用Vision Transformer生成向量嵌入，通过注意力机制估计聚类数量，并整合流形学习技术利用数据内在几何结构来优化嵌入表示。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet-100和Tiny ImageNet数据集上实现了单模态聚类和新类发现的最先进结果，无论聚类数量是否已知。

Conclusion: 证明了完全无监督方法在新类发现任务中的有效性，为开放世界场景下的图像分类提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Working with annotated data is the cornerstone of supervised learning.
Nevertheless, providing labels to instances is a task that requires significant
human effort. Several critical real-world applications make things more
complicated because no matter how many labels may have been identified in a
task of interest, it could be the case that examples corresponding to novel
classes may appear in the future. Not unsurprisingly, prior work in this,
so-called, `open-world' context has focused a lot on semi-supervised
approaches.
  Focusing on image classification, somehow paradoxically, we propose a fully
unsupervised approach to the problem of determining the novel categories in a
particular dataset. Our approach relies on estimating the number of clusters
using Vision Transformers, which utilize attention mechanisms to generate
vector embeddings. Furthermore, we incorporate manifold learning techniques to
refine these embeddings by exploiting the intrinsic geometry of the data,
thereby enhancing the overall image clustering performance. Overall, we
establish new State-of-the-Art results on single-modal clustering and Novel
Class Discovery on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet. We do
so, both when the number of clusters is known or unknown ahead of time. The

*Raja Mallina,Bryar Shareef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XBusNet是一种双提示双分支多模态模型，结合全局语义和局部边界精确性，通过自动生成的临床文本提示提高了乳腺超声分割的准确性，尤其在小痕痕和低对比度痕痕上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确的乳腺超声分割对可靠测量和定量分析至关重要，但小或低对比度痕痕因稀糖噪声和模糊边缘而难以分割。文本提示能提供临床上下文，但直接应用弱定位文本-图像线索容易产生粗糕的分割结果。

Method: 设计XBusNet双提示双分支多模态模型：全局途径使用CLIP Vision Transformer编码整体图像语义，局部U-Net途径重点关注精确边界。通过结构化元数据自动生成描述形状、边缘和BI-RADS分级的文本提示，无需手动点击。在BLU数据集上进行五折交叉验证。

Result: XBusNet在BLU数据集上达到独创性能，均值Dice系数为0.8765，IoU为0.8149，超越了六个强基线模型。小痕痕收益最大，缺失区域和假阻激活更少。分离研究证明了全局上下文、局部边界建模和提示调制的补充作用。

Conclusion: 双提示双分支多模态设计能够融合全局语义和局部精确性，产生准确的乳腺超声分割掩码，显著提高了小痕痕和低对比度痕痕的分割稳健性。

Abstract: Background: Precise breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation supports reliable
measurement, quantitative analysis, and downstream classification, yet remains
difficult for small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and speckle
noise. Text prompts can add clinical context, but directly applying weakly
localized text-image cues (e.g., CAM/CLIP-derived signals) tends to produce
coarse, blob-like responses that smear boundaries unless additional mechanisms
recover fine edges. Methods: We propose XBusNet, a novel dual-prompt,
dual-branch multimodal model that combines image features with clinically
grounded text. A global pathway based on a CLIP Vision Transformer encodes
whole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size and location, while a local
U-Net pathway emphasizes precise boundaries and is modulated by prompts that
describe shape, margin, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)
terms. Prompts are assembled automatically from structured metadata, requiring
no manual clicks. We evaluate on the Breast Lesions USG (BLU) dataset using
five-fold cross-validation. Primary metrics are Dice and Intersection over
Union (IoU); we also conduct size-stratified analyses and ablations to assess
the roles of the global and local paths and the text-driven modulation.
Results: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on BLU, with mean Dice
of 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, outperforming six strong baselines. Small lesions
show the largest gains, with fewer missed regions and fewer spurious
activations. Ablation studies show complementary contributions of global
context, local boundary modeling, and prompt-based modulation. Conclusions: A
dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal design that merges global semantics with
local precision yields accurate BUS segmentation masks and improves robustness
for small, low-contrast lesions.

Conclusion: 高级生成模型与可解释特征的协同效应能够创建高准确的医疗诊断工具

Abstract: Data scarcity hinders deep learning for medical imaging. We propose a
framework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this
using a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our
DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and
a ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained
ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived
from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused
features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and
statistical tests confirm that both the DPM augmentation and the nonlinear
feature fusion are critical, statistically significant components of this
success. This work validates the synergy between advanced generative models and
interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.

Motivation: 传统训练依赖图像-文本对，但标注通常稀疏且缺乏细粒度视觉细节，即使使用数百词描述简单图像也存在信息缺失问题

Method: Reconstruction Alignment (RecA)方法：将UMM条件化于其自身的视觉理解嵌入，通过自监督重建损失优化模型重建输入图像，从而实现理解和生成的对齐

Result: 仅用27 GPU小时，在GenEval上生成性能从0.73提升到0.90，DPGBench从80.93提升到88.15，编辑基准也有显著提升，超越更大的开源模型

Conclusion: RecA是一种高效通用的UMM后训练对齐策略，适用于自回归、掩码自回归和基于扩散的各种UMM架构

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation
within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on
image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss
fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a
simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a
resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding
encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without
captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding
embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a
self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and
generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across
autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it
consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours,
post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on
GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while
also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit
6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models
and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an
efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs

Motivation: 解决无人机多光谱目标检测面临的三个挑战：低光照图像降低多模态融合互补性、局部小目标建模受冗余信息干扰、基于Transformer的方法计算复杂度高难以在无人机平台应用

Method: 设计双域增强模块(DDE)包含跨尺度小波Mamba(CSWM)和傅里叶细节恢复块(FDR)来增强低光照图像；设计优先级引导Mamba融合模块(PGMF)通过优先级扫描从局部目标特征开始融合

Conclusion: 基于Mamba线性复杂度的DEPF方法有效解决了无人机多光谱目标检测的关键挑战，在低光照图像增强和目标检测性能方面取得了显著改进

Abstract: Multispectral remote sensing object detection is one of the important
application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, it faces three
challenges. Firstly, the low-light remote sensing images reduce the
complementarity during multi-modality fusion. Secondly, the local small target
modeling is interfered with redundant information in the fusion stage easily.
Thirdly, due to the quadratic computational complexity, it is hard to apply the
transformer-based methods on the UAV platform. To address these limitations,
motivated by Mamba with linear complexity, a UAV multispectral object detector
with dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion (DEPF) is
proposed. Firstly, to enhance low-light remote sensing images, Dual-Domain
Enhancement Module (DDE) is designed, which contains Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba
(CSWM) and Fourier Details Recovery block (FDR). CSWM applies cross-scale mamba
scanning for the low-frequency components to enhance the global brightness of
images, while FDR constructs spectrum recovery network to enhance the frequency
spectra features for recovering the texture-details. Secondly, to enhance local
target modeling and reduce the impact of redundant information during fusion,
Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module (PGMF) is designed. PGMF introduces the
concept of priority scanning, which starts from local targets features
according to the priority scores obtained from modality difference. Experiments
on DroneVehicle dataset and VEDAI dataset reports that, DEPF performs well on
object detection, comparing with state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
available in the supplementary material.

Result: 在NTU RGB+D、NTU RGB+D 120和NW-UCLA基准测试中显著提升动作识别性能，特别是对模糊样本效果明显

Conclusion: G$^{3}$CN方法具有强泛化性，能有效解决骨架动作识别中的模糊动作区分问题

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have proven to be highly effective for
skeleton-based action recognition, primarily due to their ability to leverage
graph topology for feature aggregation, a key factor in extracting meaningful
representations. However, despite their success, GCNs often struggle to
effectively distinguish between ambiguous actions, revealing limitations in the
representation of learned topological and spatial features. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel approach, Gaussian Topology Refinement Gated
Graph Convolution (G$^{3}$CN), to address the challenge of distinguishing
ambiguous actions in skeleton-based action recognition. G$^{3}$CN incorporates
a Gaussian filter to refine the skeleton topology graph, improving the
representation of ambiguous actions. Additionally, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
are integrated into the GCN framework to enhance information propagation
between skeleton points. Our method shows strong generalization across various
GCN backbones. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA
benchmarks demonstrate that G$^{3}$CN effectively improves action recognition,
particularly for ambiguous samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解析图方法主要关注单模态建模，忽略了多模态融合的潜力。语言提供了丰富的空间关系先验，但现有的全局特征融合方法会削弱遮挡区域响应并导致对齐和定位失败

Method: 提出PGVL模型，包含引导模块(GM)。低层节点关注局部特征保持遮挡区域响应，高层节点整合全局特征推断遮挡部分。采用自上而下分解和自下而上组合，构建模态特定解析图，使用递归双向交叉注意力并通过GM纯化

Result: 在主要姿态估计数据集上验证了PGVL和网络的有效性

Conclusion: PGVL通过有效的视觉-语言交互和多层次特征引导，显著提升了遮挡场景下的人体姿态估计性能

Abstract: Parse graphs boost human pose estimation (HPE) by integrating context and
hierarchies, yet prior work mostly focuses on single modality modeling,
ignoring the potential of multimodal fusion. Notably, language offers rich HPE
priors like spatial relations for occluded scenes, but existing visual-language
fusion via global feature integration weakens occluded region responses and
causes alignment and location failures. To address this issue, we propose Parse
Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL) with a core novel Guided Module
(GM). In PGVL, low-level nodes focus on local features, maximizing the
maintenance of responses in occluded areas and high-level nodes integrate
global features to infer occluded or invisible parts. GM enables high semantic
nodes to guide the feature update of low semantic nodes that have undergone
cross attention. It ensuring effective fusion of diverse information. PGVL
includes top-down decomposition and bottom-up composition. In the first stage,
modality specific parse graphs are constructed. Next stage. recursive
bidirectional cross-attention is used, purified by GM. We also design network
based on PGVL. The PGVL and our network is validated on major pose estimation
datasets. We will release the code soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D生成方法主要关注几何建模，将纹理烘焙为简单顶点颜色或依赖后处理的图像扩散模型，缺乏端到端的PBR材质生成能力

Method: 采用模块化设计：LGAA Wrapper重用多视角扩散模型层，LGAA Switcher对齐多个扩散先验，LGAA Decoder预测带PBR通道的2D高斯溅射，最后通过后处理提取高质量可重照明网格资产

Result: 在文本和图像条件多视角扩散模型上表现出优越性能，模块化设计支持灵活集成多个扩散先验，仅需6.9万多视角实例即可高效收敛

Conclusion: LGAA框架成功实现了端到端的PBR就绪3D资产生成，统一了几何和材质的建模，具有数据效率高、收敛快的优势

Abstract: The labor- and experience-intensive creation of 3D assets with physically
based rendering (PBR) materials demands an autonomous 3D asset creation
pipeline. However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry
modeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture
synthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end
PBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter
(LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR
materials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel
perspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components.
Specifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV
diffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images,
enabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple
diffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns
multiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed
variational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated
post-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh
assets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and
image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables
flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the
knowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely
69k multi-view instances. Our code, pre-trained weights, and the dataset used
will be publicly available via our project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EgoGazeVQA基准，利用注视信息提升多模态大模型在自我中心视频中的意图理解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准忽略了注视作为用户意图指示器的重要作用，自我中心视频为个性化AI体验提供了机会但缺乏注视引导的评估

Method: 构建包含注视引导QA对的基准，提出注视引导意图提示方法，整合空间、时间和意图线索

Result: 现有MLLMs难以准确理解用户意图，而注视引导方法显著提升性能，注视估计准确性影响提示效果

Conclusion: 注视信息对于在自我中心环境中实现更个性化和有效的AI助手具有重要价值

Abstract: The emergence of advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
significantly enhanced AI assistants' ability to process complex information
across modalities. Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user
focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting
opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with
MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an
indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an
egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze
information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos.
EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by
human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to
accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent
prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial,
temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on
gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts
prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more
personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings.

Conclusion: GLEAM-C和GLEAM-X构成了完整的跨视角地理定位管道，统一了准确的多模态多视角匹配与可解释推理，通过让模型更好地解释和匹配来推进地理定位技术的发展。

Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences
between images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical
location. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a
single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks
interpretability: they merely predict whether two images correspond, without
explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a
foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including
UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning
them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training
efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable
to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy.
Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods,
we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view
correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we
construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro
to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through
detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable
cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in
geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL
pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable
correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable
reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain
And Match. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XOCT是一个深度学习框架，通过跨维度监督和多尺度特征融合，从OCT图像生成高质量的OCTA血管图像，解决了现有方法忽略视网膜层间血管差异和细节重建不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OCTA图像获取困难且成本高，现有深度学习方法在视网膜分层血管重建和细节捕捉方面存在不足，需要一种能够分层重建血管细节的解决方案。

Method: 提出XOCT框架，包含跨维度监督模块（使用分层en-face投影作为监督信号）和多尺度特征融合模块（结合通道重加权策略的多尺度特征提取）。

Result: 在OCTA-500数据集上验证了XOCT的改进效果，特别是在对临床评估重要的en-face投影方面表现显著提升。

Conclusion: XOCT有潜力提高OCTA的可及性、可靠性和诊断价值，用于眼科疾病的检测和监测。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) and its derived en-face
projections provide high-resolution visualization of the retinal and choroidal
vasculature, which is critical for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of retinal
diseases. However, acquiring high-quality OCTA images is challenging due to
motion sensitivity and the high costs associated with software modifications
for conventional OCT devices. Moreover, current deep learning methods for
OCT-to-OCTA translation often overlook the vascular differences across retinal
layers and struggle to reconstruct the intricate, dense vascular details
necessary for reliable diagnosis. To overcome these limitations, we propose
XOCT, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Cross-Dimensional
Supervision (CDS) with a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) network for
layer-aware vascular reconstruction. Our CDS module leverages 2D layer-wise
en-face projections, generated via segmentation-weighted z-axis averaging, as
supervisory signals to compel the network to learn distinct representations for
each retinal layer through fine-grained, targeted guidance. Meanwhile, the MSFF
module enhances vessel delineation through multi-scale feature extraction
combined with a channel reweighting strategy, effectively capturing vascular
details at multiple spatial scales. Our experiments on the OCTA-500 dataset
demonstrate XOCT's improvements, especially for the en-face projections which
are significant for clinical evaluation of retinal pathologies, underscoring
its potential to enhance OCTA accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value
for ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于机器遗忘技术的偏置感知方法，通过选择性移除有偏样本或特征表示来减少视觉模型中的多种偏置，无需重新训练即可显著提升模型公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在训练数据中经常依赖虚假相关性，导致在医疗和自动驾驶等安全关键领域产生有偏或不公平的预测。传统偏置缓解方法需要从头重新训练或重新设计数据管道，而机器遗忘技术提供了一种有前景的事后模型校正替代方案。

Method: 基于隐私保护遗忘技术，评估了多种策略包括梯度上升、LoRA和师生蒸馏方法。在三个基准数据集（CUB-200-2011的姿态偏置、CIFAR-10的合成补丁偏置、CelebA的微笑检测中的性别偏置）上进行实证分析。

Result: 事后遗忘方法能显著减少子组差异，在CUB-200上人口统计公平性提升94.86%，CIFAR-10提升30.28%，CelebA提升97.37%。这些改进以最小的准确率损失实现，在效用、公平性、质量和隐私的联合评估中平均得分0.62。

Conclusion: 机器遗忘技术为增强已部署视觉系统的公平性提供了一个实用框架，无需进行完整的重新训练。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in training data,
leading to biased or unfair predictions in safety-critical domains such as
medicine and autonomous driving. While conventional bias mitigation typically
requires retraining from scratch or redesigning data pipelines, recent advances
in machine unlearning provide a promising alternative for post-hoc model
correction. In this work, we investigate \textit{Bias-Aware Machine
Unlearning}, a paradigm that selectively removes biased samples or feature
representations to mitigate diverse forms of bias in vision models. Building on
privacy-preserving unlearning techniques, we evaluate various strategies
including Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation. Through
empirical analysis on three benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 (pose bias),
CIFAR-10 (synthetic patch bias), and CelebA (gender bias in smile detection),
we demonstrate that post-hoc unlearning can substantially reduce subgroup
disparities, with improvements in demographic parity of up to \textbf{94.86\%}
on CUB-200, \textbf{30.28\%} on CIFAR-10, and \textbf{97.37\%} on CelebA. These
gains are achieved with minimal accuracy loss and with methods scoring an
average of 0.62 across the 3 settings on the joint evaluation of utility,
fairness, quality, and privacy. Our findings establish machine unlearning as a
practical framework for enhancing fairness in deployed vision systems without
necessitating full retraining.

Conclusion: ANYPORTAL框架成功解决了视频背景替换中的前景一致性和时间连贯性问题，为零样本视频编辑提供了有效的技术方案。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in video generation technology, creating
high-quality videos that precisely align with user intentions remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods often fail to achieve fine-grained
control over video details, limiting their practical applicability. We
introduce ANYPORTAL, a novel zero-shot framework for video background
replacement that leverages pre-trained diffusion models. Our framework
collaboratively integrates the temporal prior of video diffusion models with
the relighting capabilities of image diffusion models in a zero-shot setting.
To address the critical challenge of foreground consistency, we propose a
Refinement Projection Algorithm, which enables pixel-level detail manipulation
to ensure precise foreground preservation. ANYPORTAL is training-free and
overcomes the challenges of achieving foreground consistency and temporally
coherent relighting. Experimental results demonstrate that ANYPORTAL achieves
high-quality results on consumer-grade GPUs, offering a practical and efficient
solution for video content creation and editing.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在放射图像分类中表现出色但解释性差，限制了临床接受度。需要开发能够透明展示决策依据的自解释模型来提高临床信任。

Method: 将图像分割成不重叠的补丁，独立分类每个补丁，然后聚合预测结果，无需后处理技术即可直观显示每个补丁的诊断贡献。

Result: 在CheXpert数据集上训练，分类性能与EfficientNet-B0相当（AUROC 0.907 vs 0.908），但解释性显著提升：在CheXlocalize数据集上病理定位准确率更高（平均命中率0.485 vs Grad-CAM的0.376）。

Abstract: Deep neural networks excel in radiological image classification but
frequently suffer from poor interpretability, limiting clinical acceptance. We
present MedicalPatchNet, an inherently self-explainable architecture for chest
X-ray classification that transparently attributes decisions to distinct image
regions. MedicalPatchNet splits images into non-overlapping patches,
independently classifies each patch, and aggregates predictions, enabling
intuitive visualization of each patch's diagnostic contribution without
post-hoc techniques. Trained on the CheXpert dataset (223,414 images),
MedicalPatchNet matches the classification performance (AUROC 0.907 vs. 0.908)
of EfficientNet-B0, while substantially improving interpretability:
MedicalPatchNet demonstrates substantially improved interpretability with
higher pathology localization accuracy (mean hit-rate 0.485 vs. 0.376 with
Grad-CAM) on the CheXlocalize dataset. By providing explicit, reliable
explanations accessible even to non-AI experts, MedicalPatchNet mitigates risks
associated with shortcut learning, thus improving clinical trust. Our model is

Result: 能够生成生动自然的向量图形动画，保持了向量图形的无限分辨率和精确的颜色形状约束

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了向量图形与激浓模型之间的领域差距问题，在灵活性和动画质量方面显著改善了现有技术

Abstract: Vector graphics, known for their scalability and user-friendliness, provide a
unique approach to visual content compared to traditional pixel-based images.
Animation of these graphics, driven by the motion of their elements, offers
enhanced comprehensibility and controllability but often requires substantial
manual effort. To automate this process, we propose a novel method that
integrates implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models
for vector graphic animation. Our approach employs layered implicit neural
representations to reconstruct vector graphics, preserving their inherent
properties such as infinite resolution and precise color and shape constraints,
which effectively bridges the large domain gap between vector graphics and
diffusion models. The neural representations are then optimized using video
score distillation sampling, which leverages motion priors from pretrained
text-to-video diffusion models. Finally, the vector graphics are warped to
match the representations resulting in smooth animation. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our method in generating vivid and natural vector
graphic animations, demonstrating significant improvement over existing
techniques that suffer from limitations in flexibility and animation quality.

Abstract: We address vision-language-driven indoor navigation to assist visually
impaired individuals in reaching a target location using images and natural

an evaluation metric that refines the BERT F1 score by emphasizing directional

navigational performance. After applying LoRA, the model significantly improved
in generating directional instructions, overcoming limitations in the original

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在渲染方面效果出色，但由于表示的无结构性和缺乏显式几何监督，实现准确完整的表面重建仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 提出DiGS框架，将SDF学习直接嵌入3DGS流程，为每个高斯基元关联可学习SDF值，并设计几何引导的多尺度网格增长策略来自适应分布高斯基元。

Result: 在DTU、Mip-NeRF 360和Tanks&Temples等标准基准测试中，DiGS在保持高渲染保真度的同时，一致提高了重建准确性和完整性。

Conclusion: DiGS通过整合SDF学习到3D高斯泼溅中，成功解决了表面重建的挑战，实现了几何一致性和高质量渲染的统一。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
photorealistic view synthesis, representing scenes with spatially distributed
Gaussian primitives. While highly effective for rendering, achieving accurate
and complete surface reconstruction remains challenging due to the unstructured
nature of the representation and the absence of explicit geometric supervision.
In this work, we propose DiGS, a unified framework that embeds Signed Distance
Field (SDF) learning directly into the 3DGS pipeline, thereby enforcing strong
and interpretable surface priors. By associating each Gaussian with a learnable
SDF value, DiGS explicitly aligns primitives with underlying geometry and
improves cross-view consistency. To further ensure dense and coherent coverage,
we design a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively distributes
Gaussians along geometry-consistent regions under a multi-scale hierarchy.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and
Tanks& Temples, demonstrate that DiGS consistently improves reconstruction
accuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种通过局部混合和logits优化的新框架，用于提高深度神经网络在遥感应用中的对抗性攻击转移能力


<details>

Motivation: 当前的混合基深度学习攻击策略存在两个主要问题：全局混合或区域交换可能破坏全局语义特征，以及交叉熵损失导致的梯度消失问题

Method: 提出三种核心技术：1）局部混合策略产生多样化但语义一致的输入；2）将logit损失适配到非目标攻击场景；3）应用波动平滑损失来压制高频噪声

Result: 在FGSCR-42和MTARSI数据集上进行的实验显示，该方法在6个代理模型上超过12种最先进方法。在MTARSI数据集上以ResNet作为代理模型时，黑盒攻击成功率平均提高17.28%

Conclusion: 该研究提出的局部混合和logits优化框架能够有效提高对抗性攻击的转移能力，为深度神经网络在遥感应用中的安全部署提供了有力的安全保障

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing
significant security threats to their deployment in remote sensing
applications. Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model
vulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.
Although current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the
transferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or
directly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic
features and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,
their reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to
gradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example
quality. To address these limitations, we focus on non-targeted attacks and
propose a novel framework via local mixing and logits optimization. First, we
present a local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent
inputs. Different from MixUp, which globally blends two images, and MixCut,
which stitches images together, our method merely blends local regions to
preserve global semantic information. Second, we adapt the logit loss from
targeted attacks to non-targeted scenarios, mitigating the gradient vanishing
problem of cross-entropy loss. Third, a perturbation smoothing loss is applied
to suppress high-frequency noise and enhance transferability. Extensive
experiments on FGSCR-42 and MTARSI datasets demonstrate superior performance
over 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models. Notably, with
ResNet as the surrogate on MTARSI, our method achieves a 17.28% average
improvement in black-box attack success rate.

Motivation: 3D数据标注成本高昂，而仅依赖2D框标注存在投影模糊和部分可见性问题，需要开发更有效的弱监督方法

Method: 提出MVAT框架：1）跨时间聚合目标中心点云构建完整3D表示；2）采用师生蒸馏范式，教师网络从单视图学习但目标来自时间聚合的静态对象；3）引入多视图2D投影损失确保3D框与所有可用2D标注的一致性

Conclusion: MVAT证明了利用时序多视图信息可以有效解决弱监督3D检测中的挑战，无需任何3D框标注即可获得接近全监督方法的性能

Abstract: Annotating 3D data remains a costly bottleneck for 3D object detection,
motivating the development of weakly supervised annotation methods that rely on
more accessible 2D box annotations. However, relying solely on 2D boxes
introduces projection ambiguities since a single 2D box can correspond to
multiple valid 3D poses. Furthermore, partial object visibility under a single
viewpoint setting makes accurate 3D box estimation difficult. We propose MVAT,
a novel framework that leverages temporal multi-view present in sequential data
to address these challenges. Our approach aggregates object-centric point
clouds across time to build 3D object representations as dense and complete as
possible. A Teacher-Student distillation paradigm is employed: The Teacher
network learns from single viewpoints but targets are derived from temporally
aggregated static objects. Then the Teacher generates high quality
pseudo-labels that the Student learns to predict from a single viewpoint for
both static and moving objects. The whole framework incorporates a multi-view
2D projection loss to enforce consistency between predicted 3D boxes and all
available 2D annotations. Experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate that MVAT achieves state-of-the-art performance for weakly
supervised 3D object detection, significantly narrowing the gap with fully
supervised methods without requiring any 3D box annotations. % \footnote{Code

Abstract: Hand gesture understanding is essential for several applications in
human-computer interaction, including automatic clinical assessment of hand
dexterity. While deep learning has advanced static gesture recognition, dynamic
gesture understanding remains challenging due to complex spatiotemporal
variations. Moreover, existing datasets often lack multimodal and multi-view
diversity, precise ground-truth tracking, and an action quality component
embedded within gestures. This paper introduces EHWGesture, a multimodal video
dataset for gesture understanding featuring five clinically relevant gestures.
It includes over 1,100 recordings (6 hours), captured from 25 healthy subjects
using two high-resolution RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera. A motion
capture system provides precise ground-truth hand landmark tracking, and all
devices are spatially calibrated and synchronized to ensure cross-modal
alignment. Moreover, to embed an action quality task within gesture
understanding, collected recordings are organized in classes of execution speed
that mirror clinical evaluations of hand dexterity. Baseline experiments
highlight the dataset's potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger
detection, and action quality assessment. Thus, EHWGesture can serve as a
comprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture
understanding.

Abstract: Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has
significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated
images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and
incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions
that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control
adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few
image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages
the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific
control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small
set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks
show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks,
achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably,
when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive
performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We
also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones
and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于HU值的医学图像前景掩码策略，替代传统的随机掩码，在多个3D医学影像数据集上显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的随机掩码在3D医学图像建模中忽视了解剖结构的密度分布，无法有效利用医学图像中具有诊断意义的组织区域。

Method: 利用Hounsfield Unit (HU)测量值实现基于HU的前景掩码，专注于内脏器官的强度分布，排除空气和液体等非组织区域。

Result: 在五个公开3D医学影像数据集上取得显著性能提升：BTCV(~84.64%)、Flare22(~92.43%)、MM-WHS(~90.67%)、Amos22(~88.64%)、BraTS(~78.55%)。

Conclusion: 领域特定的掩码图像建模对医学图像分割的表征学习具有重要意义，为医学图像分析提供了有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: While Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has revolutionized fields of computer
vision, its adoption in 3D medical image computing has been limited by the use
of random masking, which overlooks the density of anatomical objects. To
address this limitation, we enhance the pretext task with a simple yet
effective masking strategy. Leveraging Hounsfield Unit (HU) measurements, we
implement an HU-based Foreground Masking, which focuses on the intensity
distribution of visceral organs and excludes non-tissue regions, such as air
and fluid, that lack diagnostically meaningful features. Extensive experiments
on five public 3D medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our masking
consistently improves performance, both in quality of segmentation and Dice
score (BTCV:~84.64\%, Flare22:~92.43\%, MM-WHS:~90.67\%, Amos22:~88.64\%,
BraTS:~78.55\%). These results underscore the importance of domain-centric MIM
and suggest a promising direction for representation learning in medical image
segmentation. Implementation is available at github.com/AISeedHub/SubFore/.

Conclusion: 该框架为语音-文档问答开辟了新方向，并发布了首个双语语音-文档RAG数据集

Abstract: Document images encapsulate a wealth of knowledge, while the portability of
spoken queries enables broader and flexible application scenarios. Yet, no
prior work has explored knowledge base question answering over visual document
images with queries provided directly in speech. We propose TextlessRAG, the
first end-to-end framework for speech-based question answering over large-scale
document images. Unlike prior methods, TextlessRAG eliminates ASR, TTS and OCR,
directly interpreting speech, retrieving relevant visual knowledge, and
generating answers in a fully textless pipeline. To further boost performance,
we integrate a layout-aware reranking mechanism to refine retrieval.
Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both efficiency and
accuracy. To advance research in this direction, we also release the first
bilingual speech--document RAG dataset, featuring Chinese and English voice
queries paired with multimodal document content. Both the dataset and our
pipeline will be made available at

Motivation: 解决从单张无姿态图片快速重建9AD全头部模型的挑战，避免传统方法的耗时过程和对3D数据集的依赖。

Method: 使用大规模合成3D GAN生成综合数据集，采用由粗到细的高斯头部生成流水线，通过双分支框架聚合结构化球面三平面特征和非结构化点基特征。

Result: 实验结果表明该框架能够在单次前向传播中完成高保真的全头部重建，性能超过现有方法。

Conclusion: 该前向传播框架为单图3D头部重建提供了高效解决方案，具有快速推理和高质量渲染的优势。

Abstract: We present a feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from a
single unposed image. Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN
inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the
Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass.
This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate
the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic
dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data.
For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian
head generation pipeline, where sparse points from the FLAME model interact
with the image features by transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse
shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity
reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D
GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that
effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and
unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head
reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework
towards existing work.

Abstract: Deep learning offers a promising avenue for automating many recognition tasks
in fields such as medicine and forensics. However, the black-box nature of
these models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications where trust and
accountability are required. For 3D shape recognition tasks in particular, this
paper introduces the Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) architecture to
address this need. Applied to 3D meshes of third molars derived from CBCT
images, for Demirjian stage allocation, CGAT utilizes graph attention
convolutions and an inherent attention mechanism, visualized via attention
rollout, to explain its decision-making process. We evaluated the local mean
curvature and distance to centroid node features, both individually and in
combination, as well as model depth, finding that models incorporating directed
edges to a global CLS node produced more intuitive attention maps, while also
yielding desirable classification performance. We analyzed the attention-based
explanations of the models, and their predictive performances to propose
optimal settings for the CGAT. The combination of local mean curvature and
distance to centroid as node features yielded a slight performance increase
with 0.76 weighted F1 score, and more comprehensive attention visualizations.
The CGAT architecture's ability to generate human-understandable attention maps
can enhance trust and facilitate expert validation of model decisions. While
demonstrated on dental data, CGAT is broadly applicable to graph-based
classification and regression tasks, promoting wider adoption of transparent
and competitive deep learning models in high-stakes environments.

Motivation: 时间图像取证领域缺乏全面综述，现有方法存在内容偏差问题，需要验证已知老化痕迹的可靠性并探索可解释AI方法的重要性。

Method: 通过分析前人工作、重新实现算法、进行实验验证，包括验证传感器缺陷的生长速率和空间分布特性，研究神经网络学习特征，测试神经网络对老化痕迹的学习能力。

Abstract: Temporal image forensics is the science of estimating the age of a digital
image. Usually, time-dependent traces (age traces) introduced by the image
acquisition pipeline are exploited for this purpose. In this review, a
comprehensive overview of the field of temporal image forensics based on
time-dependent traces from the image acquisition pipeline is given. This
includes a detailed insight into the properties of known age traces (i.e.,
in-field sensor defects and sensor dust) and temporal image forensics
techniques. Another key aspect of this work is to highlight the problem of
content bias and to illustrate how important eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence methods are to verify the reliability of temporal image forensics
techniques. Apart from reviewing material presented in previous works, in this
review: (i) a new (probably more realistic) forensic setting is proposed; (ii)
the main properties (growth rate and spatial distribution) of in-field sensor
defects are verified; (iii) it is shown that a method proposed to utilize
in-field sensor defects for image age approximation actually exploits other
traces (most likely content bias); (iv) the features learned by a neural
network dating palmprint images are further investigated; (v) it is shown how
easily a neural network can be distracted from learning age traces. For this
purpose, previous work is analyzed, re-implemented if required and experiments
are conducted.

TL;DR: 研究发现现有视觉语言模型性别偏见评估存在严重问题，即使对非性别特征进行微小扰动（如遮挡10%物体或轻微模糊背景），偏见评分就会发生显著变化，表明当前评估更多反映模型对虚假特征而非真实性别偏见的响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型性别偏见评估基准存在虚假相关性（性别与非性别特征如物体、背景的关联），需要探究这些虚假特征是否扭曲了性别偏见的评估结果。

Method: 系统性地对四个广泛使用的基准（COCO-gender、FACET、MIAP、PHASE）和各种视觉语言模型中的非性别特征进行扰动，量化其对偏见评估的影响。

Result: 即使最小扰动（遮挡10%物体或弱模糊背景）也能显著改变偏见评分：生成式视觉语言模型指标变化高达175%，CLIP变体变化达43%，表明当前评估更多反映模型对虚假特征的响应而非真实性别偏见。

Conclusion: 由于创建无虚假特征的基准具有根本性挑战，建议在报告偏见指标时同时报告特征敏感性测量，以实现更可靠的偏见评估。

Abstract: Gender bias in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) raises concerns about
their safe deployment and is typically evaluated using benchmarks with gender
annotations on real-world images. However, as these benchmarks often contain
spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects
and backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do
spurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we
systematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks
(COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact
on bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such
as masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically
alter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in
CLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model
responses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their
reliability. Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally
challenging, we recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity
measurements to enable a more reliable bias assessment.

Motivation: 现有医疗视觉-语言模型对患者元数据利用不充分，缺乏临床诊断知识的集成，而且在3D医学形象上效果有限，需要大量计算资源。

Method: 1）将结构化元数据转换为合成报告以丰富文本输入；2）添加预测MMSE分数的辅助令牌提供辅助监督；3）采用轻量级的提示微调技术。

Result: 在仅使用1,500张训练图像的情况下，在两个阿尔茫海默病数据集上达到了最佳性能，超过了需要10,000张图像进行细调的现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决现有Med-VLMs在元数据利用、临床知识集成和3D医学形象处理方面的局限性，为医疗AI领域提供了一种数据高效的细调方案。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) have shown impressive results in
tasks such as report generation and visual question answering, but they still
face several limitations. Most notably, they underutilize patient metadata and
lack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, most existing
models are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D
image-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their
effectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of
structural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient
fine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate
its application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Our system introduces
two key innovations. First, we convert structured metadata into synthetic
reports, enriching textual input for improved image-text alignment. Second, we
add an auxiliary token trained to predict the mini-mental state examination
(MMSE) score, a widely used clinical measure of cognitive function that
correlates with AD severity. This provides additional supervision for
fine-tuning. Applying lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text
modalities, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two AD
datasets using 1,500 training images, outperforming existing methods fine-tuned
on 10,000 images. Code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 解决现有深度学习方法对大量标签数据的依赖以及表征缺乏可解释性的问题。

Method: 提出自监督跨编码器框架，利用纵向MRI扫描的时间连续性进行监督，通过对比学习约束静态表征，通过输入梯度正则化指导动态表征。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上实现了更高的分类准确性和改善的可解释性，并在OASIS和PPMI数据集上显示出强劲的零样本和跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了标签数据依赖和可解释性问题，在神经退行性疾病诊断中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown significant potential in diagnosing neurodegenerative
diseases from MRI data. However, most existing methods rely heavily on large
volumes of labeled data and often yield representations that lack
interpretability. To address both challenges, we propose a novel
self-supervised cross-encoder framework that leverages the temporal continuity
in longitudinal MRI scans for supervision. This framework disentangles learned
representations into two components: a static representation, constrained by
contrastive learning, which captures stable anatomical features; and a dynamic
representation, guided by input-gradient regularization, which reflects
temporal changes and can be effectively fine-tuned for downstream
classification tasks. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our method achieves
superior classification accuracy and improved interpretability. Furthermore,
the learned representations exhibit strong zero-shot generalization on the Open
Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset and cross-task generalization
on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) dataset. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有语义水印技术虽然在重生攻击下很健壮，但因频域完整性损失导致检测性能下降，需要解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Hermitian对称频域水印（SFW）方法，通过维护Hermitian对称性保持频域完整性；采用中心感知嵌入策略提高对剪裁攻击的防御能力。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在各种攻击场景下都达到了最高的检测准确性，同时保持优秀的图像保真度（FID和CLIP分数），超越了之前的方法。

Conclusion: SFW是一个有效的框架，能够在健壮性和图像保真度之间取得平衡，解决了语义水印中的内在承偿问题。

Abstract: Semantic watermarking techniques for latent diffusion models (LDMs) are
robust against regeneration attacks, but often suffer from detection
performance degradation due to the loss of frequency integrity. To tackle this
problem, we propose a novel embedding method called Hermitian Symmetric Fourier
Watermarking (SFW), which maintains frequency integrity by enforcing Hermitian
symmetry. Additionally, we introduce a center-aware embedding strategy that
reduces the vulnerability of semantic watermarking due to cropping attacks by
ensuring robust information retention. To validate our approach, we apply these
techniques to existing semantic watermarking schemes, enhancing their
frequency-domain structures for better robustness and retrieval accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art
verification and identification performance, surpassing previous approaches
across various attack scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the impact of SFW on
detection capabilities, the effectiveness of the center-aware embedding against
cropping, and how message capacity influences identification accuracy. Notably,
our method achieves the highest detection accuracy while maintaining superior
image fidelity, as evidenced by FID and CLIP scores. Conclusively, our proposed
SFW is shown to be an effective framework for balancing robustness and image
fidelity, addressing the inherent trade-offs in semantic watermarking. Code

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Small moving target detection is crucial for many defense applications but
remains highly challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, ambiguous visual
cues, and cluttered backgrounds. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning
framework that differs fundamentally from existing approaches, which often rely
on target-specific features or motion cues and tend to lack robustness in
complex environments. Our key insight is that small target detection and
background discrimination are inherently coupled, even cluttered video
backgrounds often exhibit strong low-rank structures that can serve as stable
priors for detection. We reformulate the task as a tensor-based low-rank and
sparse decomposition problem and conduct a theoretical analysis of the
background, target, and noise components to guide model design. Building on
these insights, we introduce TenRPCANet, a deep neural network that requires
minimal assumptions about target characteristics. Specifically, we propose a
tokenization strategy that implicitly enforces multi-order tensor low-rank
priors through a self-attention mechanism. This mechanism captures both local
and non-local self-similarity to model the low-rank background without relying
on explicit iterative optimization. In addition, inspired by the sparse
component update in tensor RPCA, we design a feature refinement module to
enhance target saliency. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two highly distinct and challenging tasks: multi-frame infrared
small target detection and space object detection. These results demonstrate
both the effectiveness and the generalizability of our approach.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度图像配准方法（单应性、多网格单应性、薄板样条）在处理包含深度差异的真实场景时存在固有局限性，需要更高效的解决方案

Method: 1. 指数衰减自由形变网络（EDFFDNet）：使用指数衰减基函数的自由形变；2. 自适应稀疏运动聚合器（ASMA）：将密集交互转为稀疏交互；3. 渐进相关细化策略：利用全局-局部相关模式进行从粗到细的运动估计

Result: 参数减少70.5%，内存减少32.6%，总运行时间减少33.7%，PSNR提升0.5 dB；EDFFDNet-2进一步提升PSNR 1.06 dB，同时保持较低计算成本

Conclusion: EDFFDNet在深度差异场景中表现优异，具有强泛化能力，在多个数据集上超越先前深度学习方法，实现了效率与精度的双重提升

Abstract: Previous deep image registration methods that employ single homography,
multi-grid homography, or thin-plate spline often struggle with real scenes
containing depth disparities due to their inherent limitations. To address
this, we propose an Exponential-Decay Free-Form Deformation Network (EDFFDNet),
which employs free-form deformation with an exponential-decay basis function.
This design achieves higher efficiency and performs well in scenes with depth
disparities, benefiting from its inherent locality. We also introduce an
Adaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator (ASMA), which replaces the MLP motion
aggregator used in previous methods. By transforming dense interactions into
sparse ones, ASMA reduces parameters and improves accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a progressive correlation refinement strategy that leverages
global-local correlation patterns for coarse-to-fine motion estimation, further
enhancing efficiency and accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that EDFFDNet
reduces parameters, memory, and total runtime by 70.5%, 32.6%, and 33.7%,
respectively, while achieving a 0.5 dB PSNR gain over the state-of-the-art
method. With an additional local refinement stage,EDFFDNet-2 further improves
PSNR by 1.06 dB while maintaining lower computational costs. Our method also
demonstrates strong generalization ability across datasets, outperforming
previous deep learning methods.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在图像分类任务中表现出色但容易受到对抗样本攻击。标准的对抗训练虽然能增强鲁棒性，但未能显式处理类间特征重叠问题，这是对抗脆弱性的重要原因。

Method: 提出新颖的对抗训练框架，通过在特征空间中消除对抗样本和干净样本的类间依赖投影来减轻类间接近性。具体包括识别每个对抗样本的最近类间邻居，然后移除这些邻居上的投影以增强特征可分性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和SVHN等标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法在鲁棒准确率和干净准确率方面都取得了显著成就，与领先的对抗训练技术具有竞争性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，显式处理类间特征接近性对于增强深度神经网络的对抗鲁棒性具有重要意义，所提出的方法通过理论分析和实验验证证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have exhibited impressive performance in image
classification tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. Standard
adversarial training enhances robustness but typically fails to explicitly
address inter-class feature overlap, a significant contributor to adversarial
susceptibility. In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial training
framework that actively mitigates inter-class proximity by projecting out
inter-class dependencies from adversarial and clean samples in the feature
space. Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class
neighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto
these neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant
of neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly
contributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments
across standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that
our method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading
adversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both
robust and clean accuracy. Our findings reveal the importance of addressing
inter-class feature proximity explicitly to bolster adversarial robustness in
DNNs.

Abstract: Video understanding has seen significant progress in recent years, with
models' performance on perception from short clips continuing to rise. Yet,
multiple recent benchmarks, such as LVBench, Neptune, and ActivityNet-RTL, show
performance wanes for tasks requiring complex reasoning on videos as queries
grow more complex and videos grow longer. In this work, we ask: can existing
perception capabilities be leveraged to successfully perform more complex video
reasoning? In particular, we develop a large language model agent given access
to video modules as subagents or tools. Rather than following a fixed procedure
to solve queries as in previous work such as Visual Programming, ViperGPT, and
MoReVQA, the agent uses the results of each call to a module to determine
subsequent steps. Inspired by work in the textual reasoning domain, we
introduce a critic to distinguish between instances of successful and
unsuccessful sequences from the agent. We show that the combination of our
agent and critic achieve strong performance on the previously-mentioned

*Chunhang Zheng,Zichang Ren,Dou Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEEC提出了一种基于语义分割的多熵模型无损图像压缩方法，通过为不同语义区域分配专门的熵模型来提升压缩性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法大多使用单一熵模型估计整个图像的概率分布，无法有效捕捉不同语义区域的多样化统计特征

Method: 利用语义分割识别不同区域，为每个语义区域分配专门的熵模型，使用多通道离散逻辑混合似然建模像素值分布

Result: 在基准数据集上实现了最先进的压缩比，同时仅引入最小的编码和解码延迟，支持基于分割掩码的感兴趣区域编码

Conclusion: SEEC框架通过语义分割指导的多熵模型选择，显著提升了无损图像压缩性能，同时保持了高效的编解码效率

Abstract: Recently, learned image compression has attracted considerable attention due
to its superior performance over traditional methods. However, most existing
approaches employ a single entropy model to estimate the probability
distribution of pixel values across the entire image, which limits their
ability to capture the diverse statistical characteristics of different
semantic regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose Segmentation-Assisted
Multi-Entropy Models for Lossless Image Compression (SEEC). Our framework
utilizes semantic segmentation to guide the selection and adaptation of
multiple entropy models, enabling more accurate probability distribution
estimation for distinct semantic regions. Specifically, SEEC first extracts
image features and then applies semantic segmentation to identify different
regions, each assigned a specialized entropy model to better capture its unique
statistical properties. Finally, a multi-channel discrete logistic mixture
likelihood is employed to model the pixel value distributions effectively.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEEC achieves
state-of-the-art compression ratios while introducing only minimal encoding and
decoding latency. With superior performance, the proposed model also supports
Regions of Interest (ROIs) coding condition on the provided segmentation mask.

TL;DR: 通过多模态深度学习模型，结合CTA图像和临床数据预测脑梗梗后复发风险，发现心脏疾病和颈动脉形态与复发风险相关


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑梗梗后复发率高且死亡率极高(40%)，需要早期识别高风险患者以进行适当治疗规划

Method: 收集3D脑部CTA图像数据和临床数据(心脏疾病、年龄、性别)，训练单模态和多模态深度学习模型，进行二分类复发检测(Task1)和复发免疑生存时间预测(Task2)

Result: 多模态XSRD-net模型在测试集上获得c-index 0.68和AUC 0.71，可视化分析显示心脏疾病(表格数据)和颈动脉(图像数据)与复发风险存在关联

Conclusion: 多模态深度学习模型能够有效预测脑梗梗后复发风险，心脏疾病和颈动脉形态是关键风险因子，需要持续数据收集和模型训练来加强这一发现

Abstract: Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death world wide with an annual
mortality of around 5.5 million. Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and
25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high
(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address
this issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage
in order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D
intracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age
and the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and
multimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection
(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a
subsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse
patients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:
0.84). However, for the main task, the regression (Task 2), our multimodal
XSRD-net processed the modalities vision:tabular with 0.68:0.32 according to
modality contribution measures. The c-index with respect to relapses for the
multimodal model reached 0.68, and the AUC is 0.71 for the test dataset. Final,
deeper interpretability analysis results could highlight a link between both
heart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) for the detection of
relapses and the prediction of the RFS time. This is a central outcome that we
strive to strengthen with ongoing data collection and model retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟现实和数字人建模应用对头发重建需求日益增长，现有方法常忽略发丝的连接性和拓扑结构，需要更精确的发丝级重建方法

Method: 多阶段管道：首先使用可微分高斯光栅化器重建详细头发几何，然后通过新颖的合并方案将高斯段合并为连贯发丝，最后在光度监督下细化和增长发丝

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法能稳健处理各种发型，实现高效重建（通常在1小时内完成）

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了3DGS框架，实现了发丝级头发重建，并提出了评估拓扑准确性的新指标，为头发重建提供了更精确的解决方案

Abstract: Human hair reconstruction is a challenging problem in computer vision, with
growing importance for applications in virtual reality and digital human
modeling. Recent advances in 3D Gaussians Splatting (3DGS) provide efficient
and explicit scene representations that naturally align with the structure of
hair strands. In this work, we extend the 3DGS framework to enable strand-level
hair geometry reconstruction from multi-view images. Our multi-stage pipeline
first reconstructs detailed hair geometry using a differentiable Gaussian
rasterizer, then merges individual Gaussian segments into coherent strands
through a novel merging scheme, and finally refines and grows the strands under
photometric supervision.
  While existing methods typically evaluate reconstruction quality at the
geometric level, they often neglect the connectivity and topology of hair
strands. To address this, we propose a new evaluation metric that serves as a
proxy for assessing topological accuracy in strand reconstruction. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method robustly handles a wide range of hairstyles and achieves efficient
reconstruction, typically completing within one hour.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RayGaussX在RayGauss基础上进行优化，通过引入体积渲染加速策略、增强光线一致性、尺度正则化和新的致密化准则，实现了5-12倍训练加速和50-80倍渲染速度提升，同时PSNR提升0.56dB。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RayGauss虽然在新视角合成方面达到了最先进的渲染质量，但其计算成本过高，无法在真实场景中实现实时渲染。

Method: 引入体积渲染加速策略（空域跳过和自适应采样）、增强光线一致性、尺度正则化减少误报交点、提出新的致密化准则改善远距离区域密度分布。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上实现5-12倍训练加速、50-80倍渲染速度提升（FPS），视觉质量PSNR提升最高达0.56dB。

Conclusion: RayGaussX在保持高质量渲染的同时显著提升了训练和推理效率，适用于大规模真实场景的实时渲染应用。

Abstract: RayGauss has achieved state-of-the-art rendering quality for novel-view
synthesis on synthetic and indoor scenes by representing radiance and density
fields with irregularly distributed elliptical basis functions, rendered via
volume ray casting using a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH). However, its
computational cost prevents real-time rendering on real-world scenes. Our
approach, RayGaussX, builds on RayGauss by introducing key contributions that
accelerate both training and inference. Specifically, we incorporate volumetric
rendering acceleration strategies such as empty-space skipping and adaptive
sampling, enhance ray coherence, and introduce scale regularization to reduce
false-positive intersections. Additionally, we propose a new densification
criterion that improves density distribution in distant regions, leading to
enhanced graphical quality on larger scenes. As a result, RayGaussX achieves 5x
to 12x faster training and 50x to 80x higher rendering speeds (FPS) on
real-world datasets while improving visual quality by up to +0.56 dB in PSNR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种自监督的多视角神经网络方法，用于融合两个正交各异性低分辨率碱共振成像来重建高分辨率的结构细节，无需高分辨率数据进行训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学碱共振成像中，图像质量与扫描时间和患者舒适性需要平衡。传统方法对低分辨率扫描分析耗时且容易导致误解，需要一种能够融合不同方向低分辨率图像来重建高分辨率图像的方法。

Method: 提出了一种自监督的多视角神经网络，使用稀疏坐标基损失函数来优化模型，支持任意缩放比例的低分辨率图像融合。组合了病人无关的离线阶段和病人特定的在线阶段。

Result: 在两中独立的碱共振数据集上评估，与现有自监督超分辨率方法相比显示了相当或更好的性能。病人特定重建速度提升达10倍，同时保持了相似或更好的超分辨率质量。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效地融合多个低分辨率碱共振图像，在不需要高分辨率数据的情况下实现高质量的超分辨率重建，为医学形态学分析提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Acquiring images in high resolution is often a challenging task. Especially
in the medical sector, image quality has to be balanced with acquisition time
and patient comfort. To strike a compromise between scan time and quality for
Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, two anisotropic scans with different
low-resolution (LR) orientations can be acquired. Typically, LR scans are
analyzed individually by radiologists, which is time consuming and can lead to
inaccurate interpretation. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach for
fusing two orthogonal anisotropic LR MR images to reconstruct anatomical
details in a unified representation. Our multi-view neural network is trained
in a self-supervised manner, without requiring corresponding high-resolution
(HR) data. To optimize the model, we introduce a sparse coordinate-based loss,
enabling the integration of LR images with arbitrary scaling. We evaluate our
method on MR images from two independent cohorts. Our results demonstrate
comparable or even improved super-resolution (SR) performance compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised SR methods for different upsampling
scales. By combining a patient-agnostic offline and a patient-specific online
phase, we achieve a substantial speed-up of up to ten times for
patient-specific reconstruction while achieving similar or better SR quality.

TL;DR: SplatFill是一种基于深度引导的3D高斯溅射场景修复方法，通过联合深度监督和一致性感知优化，在视觉保真度和效率方面达到最先进水平


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射技术在修复因遮挡或场景编辑导致的缺失区域时存在模糊细节、伪影和几何不一致的问题，需要更有效的修复方法

Method: 结合深度引导和物体监督确保修复的高斯点准确放置在3D空间中，并提出一致性感知细化方案选择性识别和修正不一致区域

Result: 在SPIn-NeRF数据集上评估显示，SplatFill在视觉保真度上超越现有方法，训练时间减少24.5%，能提供更清晰的细节和更少的伪影

Conclusion: SplatFill通过深度引导和一致性优化机制，显著提升了3D高斯溅射场景修复的质量和效率，为3D场景编辑提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled the creation of highly realistic 3D
scene representations from sets of multi-view images. However, inpainting
missing regions, whether due to occlusion or scene editing, remains a
challenging task, often leading to blurry details, artifacts, and inconsistent
geometry. In this work, we introduce SplatFill, a novel depth-guided approach
for 3DGS scene inpainting that achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality and
improved efficiency. Our method combines two key ideas: (1) joint depth-based
and object-based supervision to ensure inpainted Gaussians are accurately
placed in 3D space and aligned with surrounding geometry, and (2) we propose a
consistency-aware refinement scheme that selectively identifies and corrects
inconsistent regions without disrupting the rest of the scene. Evaluations on
the SPIn-NeRF dataset demonstrate that SplatFill not only surpasses existing
NeRF-based and 3DGS-based inpainting methods in visual fidelity but also
reduces training time by 24.5%. Qualitative results show our method delivers
sharper details, fewer artifacts, and greater coherence across challenging
viewpoints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型与3D点云之间的表示对齐问题，避免密集点块预对齐带来的语义损失和相似干扰物混淆，同时保持细粒度几何精度

Method: 提出对象中心判别表示(OcDR)学习目标语义和场景关系的对象中心token，以及几何重激活解码器(GRD)结合LLM推断的几何信息与密集特征进行精确分割

Result: 在ScanNetv2上提升7.3 mIoU，在Multi3DRefer上提升6.0 mIoU，在7个基准测试的4个不同任务中均取得一致性能提升

Conclusion: PLM通过全面的对象中心推理实现了鲁棒的3D理解，有效弥合了LLM与密集3D点云之间的表示差距

Abstract: 3D object segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a
prevailing paradigm due to its broad semantics, task flexibility, and strong
generalization. However, this paradigm is hindered by representation
misalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds
convey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits
both input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy
pre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar
distractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features
without explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To
address these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general
framework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point
clouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or
3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative
Representation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target
semantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective.
This mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances
resilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within
LLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation
Decoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying
LLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving
comprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments
show that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and
+6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains
across 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness
of comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding.

presents a novel approach to automated burned area mapping using the AlphaEArth
dataset combined with the Siamese U-Net deep learning architecture. The
AlphaEArth Dataset, comprising high-resolution optical and thermal infrared

and evaluated it with 17 regions cross in Europe. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed ensemble approach achieves superior performance
with an overall accuracy of 95%, IoU of 0.6, and F1-score of 74% on the test

ecosystems with complex background, showing particular strength in detecting
partially burned vegetation and fire boundaries and its transferability and
high generalization in burned area mapping. This research contributes to the
advancement of automated fire damage assessment and provides a scalable

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在图像描述和视觉问答任务中表现良好，但容易产生与视觉输入冲突的幻觉文本。现有方法通常对所有层和头进行统一调整，无法准确定位错误来源。

Method: 提出了两种诊断方法：层图像注意力熵(LIAE)用于标记异常层，图像注意力聚焦(IAF)用于对层内注意力头进行评分。基于这些信号，开发了动态层级熵和注意力融合(D-LEAF)方法，在推理过程中动态定位和修正错误。

Result: 在标准图像描述基准上相对改进53%，在VQA任务中准确率和F1分数均提升约4%，显著抑制幻觉同时保持效率。

Conclusion: D-LEAF方法能够有效诊断和修正MLLM中的幻觉问题，通过注意力引导的动态调整机制实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on tasks
like image captioning and visual question answering, but remain prone to
hallucinations, where generated text conflicts with the visual input. Prior
work links this partly to insufficient visual attention, but existing
attention-based detectors and mitigation typically apply uniform adjustments
across layers and heads, obscuring where errors originate. In this paper, we
first show these methods fail to accurately localize problematic layers. Then,
we introduce two diagnostics: Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) which flags
anomalous layers, and Image Attention Focus (IAF) which scores attention heads
within those layers. Analysis shows that LIAE pinpoints faulty layers and IAF
reliably ranks heads that warrant correction. Guided by these signals, we
propose Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF), a
task-agnostic, attention-guided method that dynamically localizes and corrects
errors during inference with negligible overhead. Results show our D-LEAF
delivers a 53% relative improvement on standard captioning benchmarks, and on
VQA both accuracy and F1-score improve by approximately 4%, substantially
suppressing hallucinations while preserving efficiency.

Abstract: Active Membership Inference Test (aMINT) is a method designed to detect
whether given data were used during the training of machine learning models. In
Active MINT, we propose a novel multitask learning process that involves
training simultaneously two models: the original or Audited Model, and a
secondary model, referred to as the MINT Model, responsible for identifying the
data used for training the Audited Model. This novel multi-task learning
approach has been designed to incorporate the auditability of the model as an
optimization objective during the training process of neural networks. The
proposed approach incorporates intermediate activation maps as inputs to the
MINT layers, which are trained to enhance the detection of training data. We
present results using a wide range of neural networks, from lighter
architectures such as MobileNet to more complex ones such as Vision
Transformers, evaluated in 5 public benchmarks. Our proposed Active MINT
achieves over 80% accuracy in detecting if given data was used for training,
significantly outperforming previous approaches in the literature. Our aMINT
and related methodological developments contribute to increasing transparency
in AI models, facilitating stronger safeguards in AI deployments to achieve
proper security, privacy, and copyright protection.

Motivation: 现有方法主要建立在支持目标对象与整个查询图像之间的图像级相关性，但这种相关性包含难以追踪和抑制的硬像素噪声（如无关背景对象），导致背景过拟合。

Conclusion: 通过模仿生物视觉过程在对象级信息中识别新对象，建立对象级相关性可以挖掘查询目标特征并抑制硬像素噪声，从而提高少样本语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment objects of novel
categories in the query images given only a few annotated support samples.
Existing methods primarily build the image-level correlation between the
support target object and the entire query image. However, this correlation
contains the hard pixel noise, \textit{i.e.}, irrelevant background objects,
that is intractable to trace and suppress, leading to the overfitting of the
background. To address the limitation of this correlation, we imitate the
biological vision process to identify novel objects in the object-level
information. Target identification in the general objects is more valid than in
the entire image, especially in the low-data regime. Inspired by this, we
design an Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) by establishing the
object-level correlation between the support target object and query general
objects, which is mainly composed of the General Object Mining Module (GOMM)
and Correlation Construction Module (CCM). Specifically, GOMM constructs the
query general object feature by learning saliency and high-level similarity
cues, where the general objects include the irrelevant background objects and
the target foreground object. Then, CCM establishes the object-level
correlation by allocating the target prototypes to match the general object
feature. The generated object-level correlation can mine the query target
feature and suppress the hard pixel noise for the final prediction. Extensive
experiments on PASCAL-${5}^{i}$ and COCO-${20}^{i}$ show that our model
achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Joint reconstruction of human-object interaction marks a significant
milestone in comprehending the intricate interrelations between humans and
their surrounding environment. Nevertheless, previous optimization methods
often struggle to achieve physically plausible reconstruction results due to
the lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions. In this paper, we
introduce ScoreHOI, an effective diffusion-based optimizer that introduces
diffusion priors for the precise recovery of human-object interactions. By
harnessing the controllability within score-guided sampling, the diffusion
model can reconstruct a conditional distribution of human and object pose given
the image observation and object feature. During inference, the ScoreHOI
effectively improves the reconstruction results by guiding the denoising
process with specific physical constraints. Furthermore, we propose a
contact-driven iterative refinement approach to enhance the contact
plausibility and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Extensive evaluations on
standard benchmarks demonstrate ScoreHOI's superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its ability to achieve a precise and
robust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction.

Abstract: Digital dentistry represents a transformative shift in modern dental
practice. The foundational step in this transformation is the accurate digital
representation of the patient's dentition, which is obtained from segmented
Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scans (IOS). Despite the
growing interest in digital dental technologies, existing segmentation
methodologies frequently lack rigorous validation and demonstrate limited
performance and clinical applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to introduce a multimodal pretraining framework for tooth
segmentation. We present ToothMCL, a Tooth Multimodal Contrastive Learning for
pretraining that integrates volumetric (CBCT) and surface-based (IOS)
modalities. By capturing modality-invariant representations through multimodal
contrastive learning, our approach effectively models fine-grained anatomical
features, enabling precise multi-class segmentation and accurate identification
of F\'ed\'eration Dentaire Internationale (FDI) tooth numbering. Along with the
framework, we curated CBCT-IOS3.8K, the largest paired CBCT and IOS dataset to
date, comprising 3,867 patients. We then evaluated ToothMCL on a comprehensive
collection of independent datasets, representing the largest and most diverse
evaluation to date. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
internal and external testing, with an increase of 12\% for CBCT segmentation
and 8\% for IOS segmentation in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).
Furthermore, ToothMCL consistently surpasses existing approaches in tooth
groups and demonstrates robust generalizability across varying imaging
conditions and clinical scenarios.

Motivation: 当前对象检测器在消费级硬件上实际性能与基准测试存在显著差距，系统级瓶颈成为主要限制因素而非计算能力

Result: 在5000张COCO图像数据集上，相比PyTorch Early-Exit基线速度提升1.85倍，mAP损失仅为5.51%

Conclusion: 通过从纯粹模型优化转向硬件感知的推理策略，为消费级设备部署高性能实时AI提供了可复现的解决方案

Abstract: As local AI grows in popularity, there is a critical gap between the
benchmark performance of object detectors and their practical viability on
consumer-grade hardware. While models like YOLOv10s promise real-time speeds,
these metrics are typically achieved on high-power, desktop-class GPUs. This
paper reveals that on resource-constrained systems, such as laptops with RTX
4060 GPUs, performance is not compute-bound but is instead dominated by
system-level bottlenecks, as illustrated by a simple bottleneck test. To
overcome this hardware-level constraint, we introduce a Two-Pass Adaptive
Inference algorithm, a model-independent approach that requires no
architectural changes. This study mainly focuses on adaptive inference
strategies and undertakes a comparative analysis of architectural early-exit
and resolution-adaptive routing, highlighting their respective trade-offs
within a unified evaluation framework. The system uses a fast, low-resolution
pass and only escalates to a high-resolution model pass when detection
confidence is low. On a 5000-image COCO dataset, our method achieves a 1.85x
speedup over a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline, with a modest mAP loss of 5.51%.
This work provides a practical and reproducible blueprint for deploying
high-performance, real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by shifting the focus
from pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that
maximize throughput.

Abstract: Characterization of uncooperative Resident Space Objects (RSO) play a crucial
role in On-Orbit Servicing (OOS) and Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions to
assess the geometry and motion properties. To address the challenges of
reconstructing tumbling uncooperative targets, this study evaluates the
performance of existing state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction algorithms for
dynamic scenes, focusing on their ability to generate geometrically accurate
models with high-fidelity. To support our evaluation, we developed a simulation
environment using Isaac Sim to generate physics-accurate 2D image sequences of
tumbling satellite under realistic orbital lighting conditions. Our preliminary
results on static scenes using Neuralangelo demonstrate promising
reconstruction quality. The generated 3D meshes closely match the original CAD
models with minimal errors and artifacts when compared using Cloud Compare
(CC). The reconstructed models were able to capture critical fine details for
mission planning. This provides a baseline for our ongoing evaluation of
dynamic scene reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种解码器，通过生成与用户指定特征高度匹配的图像来分析深度神经网络的内部特征空间，解决了DNN黑盒问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络内部特征提取过程具有黑盒特性，难以理解其编码机制，需要一种能够生成特定特征对应图像的方法来揭示特征空间结构

Method: 采用引导扩散模型，在预训练扩散模型的反向图像生成过程中引导最小化生成图像特征与目标特征之间的欧氏距离

Result: 实验针对CLIP图像编码器、ResNet-50和视觉变换器，生成图像的特征与目标特征高度相似，成功揭示了这些DNN的特征空间特性

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练即可分析不同DNN的特征空间，在单个商用GPU上运行，为理解神经网络内部表示提供了有效工具

Abstract: One of the key issues in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the black-box nature
of their internal feature extraction process. Targeting vision-related domains,
this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a
decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match
a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past
studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various attributes in an
image are encoded into a feature by the DNN, by generating images whose
features are in proximity to that feature. Our decoder is implemented as a
guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a
pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the
feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature.
One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of
different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The
experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision
transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features
remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into
these DNNs' feature spaces.

Abstract: Visual reasoning over structured data such as tables is a critical capability
for modern vision-language models (VLMs), yet current benchmarks remain limited
in scale, diversity, or reasoning depth, especially when it comes to rendered
table images. Addressing this gap, we introduce Visual-TableQA, a large-scale,
open-domain multimodal dataset specifically designed to evaluate and enhance
visual reasoning over complex tabular data. Our generation pipeline is modular,
scalable, and fully autonomous, involving multiple reasoning LLMs collaborating
across distinct roles: generation, validation, and inspiration. Visual-TableQA
comprises 2.5k richly structured LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k
reasoning-intensive QA pairs, all produced at a cost of under USD 100. To
promote diversity and creativity, our pipeline performs multi-model
collaborative data generation via cross-model prompting ('inspiration') and
LLM-jury filtering. Stronger models seed layouts and topics that weaker models
elaborate, collectively distilling diverse reasoning patterns and visual
structures into the dataset. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on
Visual-TableQA generalize robustly to external benchmarks, outperforming
several proprietary models despite the dataset's synthetic nature. The full
pipeline and resources are publicly available at

Conclusion: Mini-o3通过扩大工具交互规模、多样化推理模式和超轮掩码策略，成功实现了深度多轮推理能力，在具有挑战性的视觉搜索任务上达到了最先进性能，为大多模态模型的推理能力提升提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models have leveraged image-based tools
with reinforcement learning to tackle visual problems. However, existing
open-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow
only a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for
difficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we
address this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce
Mini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of
steps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search
tasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key
components. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of
thousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory
reasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain
cold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including
depth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an
over-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses
(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,
thereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite
training with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates
trajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with
accuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking
paths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems.

TL;DR: OnePoseViaGen是一个从单张参考图像估计任意未见物体6D位姿的先进方法，通过粗到精对齐和文本引导域随机化策略解决单视图重建缺乏度量尺度和域差距问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人操作中罕见物体的6D位姿估计问题，传统方法面临3D模型稀缺、单视图重建缺乏度量尺度以及合成数据与真实图像域差距大的挑战

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 粗到精对齐模块结合多视图特征匹配和渲染比较优化来联合优化尺度和位姿；2) 文本引导生成域随机化策略多样化纹理，使合成数据能够有效微调位姿估计器

Result: 在YCBInEOAT、Toyota-Light、LM-O等挑战性基准测试中达到最先进性能，远超先前方法，并在真实机器人手上展示了稳健的灵巧抓取能力

Conclusion: 该方法通过高保真单视图3D生成支持可靠的单次6D位姿估计，验证了在真实世界操作中的实用性

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of arbitrary unseen objects from a single reference
image is critical for robotics operating in the long-tail of real-world
instances. However, this setting is notoriously challenging: 3D models are
rarely available, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain
gaps between generated models and real-world images undermine robustness. We
propose OnePoseViaGen, a pipeline that tackles these challenges through two key
components. First, a coarse-to-fine alignment module jointly refines scale and
pose by combining multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare
refinement. Second, a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy
diversifies textures, enabling effective fine-tuning of pose estimators with
synthetic data. Together, these steps allow high-fidelity single-view 3D
generation to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation. On challenging
benchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), OnePoseViaGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance far surpassing prior approaches. We further
demonstrate robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand, validating the
practicality of our method in real-world manipulation. Project page:

TL;DR: VIRAL是一种通过将MLLMs的内部视觉表示与预训练视觉基础模型对齐的简单但有效的正则化策略，能够保留关键视觉细节并增强复杂视觉推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视觉中心任务（如物体计数、空间推理）上表现有限，主要原因是文本监督范式只能提供视觉通路的间接指导，导致训练过程中丢失细粒度视觉细节

Method: 提出VIRAL方法，通过正则化策略显式对齐MLLMs内部视觉表示与预训练视觉基础模型的表示，既保留输入视觉编码器的关键细节，又补充来自VFMs的额外视觉知识

Result: 实验表明在广泛采用的多模态基准测试中所有任务都取得了一致改进，并通过全面的消融研究验证了关键设计选择

Conclusion: 这一简单发现为在训练MLLMs时有效整合视觉信息开辟了重要方向

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction
tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain
limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning.
We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which
provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to
discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present
VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization
strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of
pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this
alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details
from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual
knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex
visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all
tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying
our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction
for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.
