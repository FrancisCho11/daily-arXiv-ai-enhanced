### [1] [Heatmap Regression without Soft-Argmax for Facial Landmark Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14929)
*Chiao-An Yang,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了面部关键点检测中广泛使用的Soft-argmax方法，提出了一种基于结构化预测框架的替代训练目标，在三个基准数据集上实现了最先进性能，训练收敛速度快2.2倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热图回归方法在面部关键点检测中广泛使用，但argmax操作不可微分，传统使用Soft-argmax作为近似。作者质疑这种长期选择，认为这不是实现强性能的唯一方式。

Method: 提出基于经典结构化预测框架的替代训练目标，避免了Soft-argmax的使用，实现了端到端的可微分训练。

Result: 在WFLW、COFW和300W三个面部关键点基准测试中达到最先进性能，训练收敛速度快2.2倍，同时保持更好/有竞争力的准确率。

Conclusion: Soft-argmax不是面部关键点检测中实现高性能的唯一方法，基于结构化预测的替代方法在收敛速度和准确性方面都表现出色，为这一领域提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with
numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face
swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to
achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing
the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not
differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,
to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this
long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the
only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative
training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial
landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during
training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy. Our code is available
here: https://github.com/ca-joe-yang/regression-without-softarg.

### [2] [Fast Graph Neural Network for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14958)
*Mustafa Mohammadi Gharasuie,Luis Rueda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种将图卷积网络与Voronoi图相结合的新方法，通过将图像表示为图结构并利用Delaunay三角剖分进行优化，显著提升了图像分类的预处理效率和分类精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络在处理复杂数据结构时存在局限，需要更有效的方法来建模图像中的关系数据，特别是在处理复杂场景和细粒度类别时。

Method: 将图像表示为图结构（像素或区域作为顶点），使用Voronoi图和对应的Delaunay三角剖分优化图表示，然后应用图卷积网络进行分类。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了显著的预处理效率提升和分类准确率改进，特别是在复杂场景和细粒度分类任务中超越了最先进的方法。

Conclusion: GCN与Voronoi图的结合为图像分类提供了新的视角，扩展了基于图的学习范式在计算机视觉和非结构化数据分析中的应用潜力。

Abstract: The rapid progress in image classification has been largely driven by the
adoption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which offer a robust framework
for handling complex data structures. This study introduces a novel approach
that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by
leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images
as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then
refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their
representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both
preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark
datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging
scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental
results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of
combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This
research not only presents a novel perspective on image classification but also
expands the potential applications of graph-based learning paradigms in
computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

### [3] [You Only Pose Once: A Minimalist's Detection Transformer for Monocular RGB Category-level 9D Multi-Object Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14965)
*Hakjin Lee,Junghoon Seo,Jaehoon Sim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOPO是一个单阶段、基于查询的框架，将类别级9自由度姿态估计统一到2D检测中，仅使用RGB图像就达到了最先进的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖伪深度、CAD模型或多阶段级联，需要更简单的RGB-only解决方案来直接从类别级别学习

Method: 在transformer检测器基础上增加轻量级姿态头、边界框条件平移模块和6D感知匈牙利匹配成本，端到端训练

Result: 在REAL275数据集上达到79.6% IoU50和54.1%的10°10cm指标，超越所有RGB-only方法，接近RGB-D系统性能

Conclusion: YOPO证明了单阶段RGB-only方法可以实现高性能的9自由度姿态估计，简化了系统设计并缩小了与RGB-D系统的差距

Abstract: Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific
categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and
automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or
multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated
by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the
category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and
9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional
data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based
framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of
2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose
head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian
matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and
category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new
state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6%
$\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing
prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code,
models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

### [4] [Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework for Joint Physical-Digital Face Attack Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14980)
*Andrei Balykin,Anvar Ganiev,Denis Kondranin,Kirill Polevoda,Nikolai Liudkevich,Artem Petrov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的训练框架Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework，能够同时检测物理呈现攻击和数字伪造攻击，在Face Anti-Spoofing挑战赛上取得2.10%的错误率，模型轻量且训练快速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人脸识别系统使用分离的模型处理物理攻击和数字伪造攻击，这增加了系统复杂性、推理延迟，并且无法应对组合攻击向量。需要一种统一的检测方法。

Method: 提出配对采样对比框架，利用自动匹配的真实和攻击自拍对，学习模态无关的活体检测线索。通过对比学习来统一处理不同攻击类型。

Result: 在第六届Face Anti-Spoofing挑战赛的统一物理-数字攻击检测基准上，平均分类错误率(ACER)达到2.10%，优于现有解决方案。模型计算量仅为4.46 GFLOPs，训练时间不到1小时。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种轻量级、高效的统一解决方案，能够同时处理物理和数字攻击，具有实际部署的可行性，代码和预训练模型已开源。

Abstract: Modern face recognition systems remain vulnerable to spoofing attempts,
including both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries.
Traditionally, these two attack vectors have been handled by separate models,
each targeting its own artifacts and modalities. However, maintaining distinct
detectors increases system complexity and inference latency and leaves systems
exposed to combined attack vectors. We propose the Paired-Sampling Contrastive
Framework, a unified training approach that leverages automatically matched
pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.
Evaluated on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital
Attack Detection benchmark, our method achieves an average classification error
rate (ACER) of 2.10 percent, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is
lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour, making it practical for
real-world deployment. Code and pretrained models are available at

### [5] [TAIGen: Training-Free Adversarial Image Generation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15020)
*Susim Roy,Anubhooti Jain,Mayank Vatsa,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAIGen是一种无需训练的黑盒对抗图像生成方法，通过仅需3-20个采样步骤从无条件扩散模型生成高质量对抗样本，比现有方法快10倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型的对抗攻击往往产生低质量图像且计算资源需求大，扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像但需要数百个采样步骤。

Method: 在混合步骤区间注入扰动，采用选择性RGB通道策略：对红色通道应用注意力图，对绿色和蓝色通道使用GradCAM引导的扰动，保持图像结构同时最大化目标模型的误分类。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，对VGGNet作为源模型，TAIGen对ResNet成功率为70.6%，对MNASNet为80.8%，对ShuffleNet为97.8%。PSNR保持在30dB以上，生成速度快10倍。

Conclusion: TAIGen是最具影响力的攻击方法，防御机制对其生成的图像净化效果最差，实现了最低的鲁棒准确率。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images
and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though
capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps
for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free
black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces
adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional
diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the
mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing
all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies
attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on
green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing
misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR
above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,
TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%
against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than
existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust
accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism
is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

### [6] [Reversible Unfolding Network for Concealed Visual Perception with Generative Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15027)
*Chunming He,Fengyang Xiao,Rihan Zhang,Chengyu Fang,Deng-Ping Fan,Sina Farsiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RUN++是一个可逆展开网络，通过生成式细化解决隐蔽视觉感知问题，在掩码和RGB域同时应用可逆建模，并使用扩散模型处理不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的隐蔽视觉感知方法主要局限于掩码域，未能充分利用RGB域的潜力，且在处理不确定性方面存在不足。

Method: 将CVP任务建模为数学优化问题，展开为多阶段深度网络。包含三个模块：CORE模块在掩码域应用可逆建模识别核心目标区域；CARE模块在RGB域扩展该原则以改善前景-背景分离；FINE模块使用伯努利扩散模型仅细化不确定区域。

Result: 提出的方法能够有效减少假阳性和假阴性，在真实世界退化条件下保持鲁棒性，并建立了更广泛的双层优化框架。

Conclusion: RUN++通过可逆建模和生成式细化的协同作用，为隐蔽视觉感知提供了高效且有效的解决方案，特别是在处理不确定性和计算效率方面表现出色。

Abstract: Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage
reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined
to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To
address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative
refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as
a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a
multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply
reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a
diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network
integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction
(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core
object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this
principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;
and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a
final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion
model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,
harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration
without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique
synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for
the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward
ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.
Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that
remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a
broader bi-level optimization framework.

Conclusion: GasTwinFormer通过有效利用饮食-排放相关性，为实时牲畜排放监测提供了实用解决方案，消融研究验证了各架构组件的有效性。

Abstract: Livestock methane emissions represent 32% of human-caused methane production,
making automated monitoring critical for climate mitigation strategies. We
introduce GasTwinFormer, a hybrid vision transformer for real-time methane
emission segmentation and dietary classification in optical gas imaging through
a novel Mix Twin encoder alternating between spatially-reduced global attention
and locally-grouped attention mechanisms. Our architecture incorporates a
lightweight LR-ASPP decoder for multi-scale feature aggregation and enables
simultaneous methane segmentation and dietary classification in a unified
framework. We contribute the first comprehensive beef cattle methane emission
dataset using OGI, containing 11,694 annotated frames across three dietary
treatments. GasTwinFormer achieves 74.47% mIoU and 83.63% mF1 for segmentation
while maintaining exceptional efficiency with only 3.348M parameters, 3.428G
FLOPs, and 114.9 FPS inference speed. Additionally, our method achieves perfect
dietary classification accuracy (100%), demonstrating the effectiveness of
leveraging diet-emission correlations. Extensive ablation studies validate each
architectural component, establishing GasTwinFormer as a practical solution for
real-time livestock emission monitoring. Please see our project page at

### [8] [CurveFlow: Curvature-Guided Flow Matching for Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15093)
*Yan Luo,Drake Du,Hao Huang,Yi Fang,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CurveFlow提出了一种新颖的流匹配框架，通过引入曲率正则化来学习平滑的非线性轨迹，显著提升了文本到图像生成中的语义一致性和指令遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有整流流模型基于数据和噪声分布之间的线性轨迹，这种线性强制零曲率可能导致生成过程经过数据流形的低概率区域，影响语义对齐和指令遵循能力。

Method: 引入曲率引导到流路径中，采用鲁棒的曲率正则化技术惩罚轨迹内在动力学的突变，学习平滑的非线性轨迹。

Result: 在MS COCO 2014和2017数据集上的实验表明，CurveFlow在文本到图像生成中达到最先进性能，在BLEU、METEOR、ROUGE和CLAIR等语义一致性指标上显著优于标准整流流变体和其他非线性基线。

Conclusion: 曲率感知建模显著增强了模型忠实遵循复杂指令的能力，同时保持高图像质量，证实了轨迹曲率与语义对齐之间的重要关联。

Abstract: Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data
and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can
inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability
regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does
the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment
between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional
compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching
framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly
incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a
robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the
trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017
demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in
text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified
flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The
improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as
BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling
substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex
instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is
made publicly available at
https://github.com/Harvard-AI-and-Robotics-Lab/CurveFlow.

### [9] [HiRQA: Hierarchical Ranking and Quality Alignment for Opinion-Unaware Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15130)
*Vaishnav Ramesh,Haining Wang,Md Jahidul Islam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiRQA是一个自监督的无参考图像质量评估框架，通过分层排序和对齐学习实现质量感知嵌入，无需参考图像或主观标签，在合成和真实失真上都表现出优异的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无参考图像质量评估方法存在数据集偏差和依赖主观标签的问题，限制了其泛化能力。需要开发不依赖原始参考图像或辅助模态的自监督方法。

Method: 提出HiRQA框架，结合排序学习和对比学习：1）高阶排序损失监督质量预测的关系排序；2）嵌入距离损失确保特征距离与感知差异一致；3）基于结构化文本提示的对比对齐损失增强表示学习。

Result: 仅在合成失真上训练的HiRQA能有效泛化到真实退化场景（如镜头光晕、雾霾、运动模糊、低光条件）。轻量级变体HiRQA-S推理时间仅3.5ms/图像，在合成和真实基准测试中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: HiRQA通过自监督的层次化排序和对齐学习，实现了优异的图像质量评估性能，具有强大的泛化能力和实时部署可行性，为无参考IQA提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment
(NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder
their generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and
Quality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a
hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and
contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine
references or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality
scores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking
loss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across
distortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces
consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A
training-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,
further enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic
distortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as
demonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,
haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we
introduce \textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of
only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments across synthetic and authentic
benchmarks validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, strong
generalization ability, and scalability.

### [10] [Reliable Multi-view 3D Reconstruction for `Just-in-time' Edge Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15158)
*Md. Nurul Absur,Abhinav Kumar,Swastik Brahma,Saptarshi Debroy*

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视角3D重建在紧急响应、战术场景等关键应用中需要迅速情况感知。但边缘环境的动态性和运营挑战导致相机操作受到空间时间相关干扰，影响重建质量。

Method: 采用投资组合理论作为优化框架，通过遗传算法快速求解相机选择策略，以应对可能的系统干扰。

Result: 在公开和自定制3D数据集上验证，证明该策略能够在空间时间干扰下保证3D重建质量，效果优于传统基准方法。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种有效的边缘资源管理方案，能够在动态和不确定的边缘环境中保证多视角3D重建的可靠性和质量。

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use
cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response,
tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time
latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate
adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the
fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,
reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational
adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated
disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained
degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable
multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed
methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the
cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio
theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that
converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and
customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's
benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional
baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating
early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in
DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a
lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM
(eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that
leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis
coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a
specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt
Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological
features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.
These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key
pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and
detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive
experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and
an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept
detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the
high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations,
showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and
clinical needs by providing robust and interpretable insights.

Result: 在几何对齐和生成质量方面优于现有方法，能够生成高质量、风格一致的室外场景，并支持通过重照明和风格转换技术进行多样化渲染。

Conclusion: MeSS方法成功解决了城市网格模型纹理缺失问题，为虚拟城市导航和自动驾驶提供了高质量的3D场景生成解决方案，在几何一致性和视觉质量方面表现出色。

Abstract: Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however,
the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban
navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS
(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent
outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While
image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth
maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective
views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion
models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but
often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with
rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to
guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned
results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach
enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The
pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically
consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we
propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and
third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)
using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh
surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment
and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse
styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术部位感染是常见且昂贵的医疗相关感染，现有深度学习研究受限于数据隐私和专家标注成本，缺乏公开数据集和开源筛查工具

Method: 1) 构建包含697张手术伤口图像的SurgWound数据集，由3名专业外科医生标注8个临床属性；2) 建立包含视觉问答和报告生成任务的基准测试；3) 提出三阶段学习框架WoundQwen，使用多个MLLM分别预测伤口特征、诊断结果并生成综合报告

Conclusion: 该研究为个性化伤口护理、及时干预和改善患者预后奠定了基础，推动了手术伤口筛查工具的发展

Abstract: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a
significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient
outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for
preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns
over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.
Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types
of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound
screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first
open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It
contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with
eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce
the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual
question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively
evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning
framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we
employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound
characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional
knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess
infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train
a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to
produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed
surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients
based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely
intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

Abstract: Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units
relies on instance-level segmentation, yet most existing datasets and automated
methods provide only binary (semantic) masks, limiting the precision of
downstream analyses. Although classical post-processing techniques such as
watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to
separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is
constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal
tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided
binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our
approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations
within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and
customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through
systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and
heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and
na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating
more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows. The pipeline

Abstract: Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road
safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property
damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human
drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents
before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors
such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents
a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In
this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them
through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural
networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three
publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves
higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous
methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and
tested on different datasets.

TL;DR: TriMM是首个前馈式3D原生生成模型，通过多模态协作编码（RGB、RGBD、点云）和triplane潜在扩散模型，有效利用多模态数据提升3D资产生成的纹理和几何质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D生成模型大多局限于单一模态或3D结构，无法充分利用多模态数据的互补优势，限制了训练数据集的范围和模型性能。

Method: 1）引入协作多模态编码整合模态特定特征；2）采用2D和3D辅助监督提升鲁棒性；3）基于triplane潜在扩散模型生成高质量3D资产

Result: 在多个知名数据集上的实验表明，TriMM仅使用少量训练数据就能达到与大规模数据集训练模型相竞争的性能，并在RGB-D数据集上验证了多模态数据集整合的可行性

Conclusion: TriMM通过有效利用多模态数据，在3D生成任务中实现了优异的性能，为多模态3D生成提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be
projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds).
Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images
contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D
geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either
operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the
complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D
structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To
holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the
first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic
multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM
first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates
modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational
strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to
raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the
embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to
generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the
geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets
demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves
competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite
utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional
experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of
incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

Motivation: 现有对比学习方法在聚类任务中存在类间冲突问题，硬原型计算与真实聚类中心存在偏差，需要更有效的原型计算方法

Method: 软原型对比模块使用样本属于聚类中心的概率作为权重计算类别原型；双重一致性学习模块对齐相同样本的不同变换和不同样本的邻域

Result: 在五个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法相比最先进方法具有有效性

Conclusion: 该方法通过软原型计算和双重一致性学习有效解决了类间冲突和原型漂移问题，提升了聚类性能

Abstract: Contrastive learning is widely used in clustering tasks due to its
discriminative representation. However, the conflict problem between classes is
difficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem
through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of
hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we
propose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which
consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning
module. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability
that the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the
prototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing
prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different
transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples
respectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic
information and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable
guarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA. Our
code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/CPCC.

Conclusion: 双高度协同方案有效解决了单一无人机导航的挑战，通过分工协作实现了高效的环境理解和精准导航，为户外无人机导航提供了可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an emerging task that enables
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate outdoor environments using natural
language instructions and visual cues. However, due to the extended
trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN
performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly
detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which
could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion
space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV
Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct
altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,
and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training
and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising
13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with
target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps
and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's
generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.
To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV
collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a
multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the
low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and
target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal
coordinate information to ensure efficiency.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了跳跃步采样机制，通过跳过多个中间去噪步骤来加速传播模型的生成过程，而无需依赖非马尔可夫过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传播模型虽然在生成任务上表现突出，但其序列化生成过程需要长序列步骤生成，效率较低。现有方法如DDIM尝试减少采样步骤，但仍需要构建非马尔可夫过程。研究者想要探索原始传播过程是否能够以马尔可夫方式实现同样的加速效果。

Method: 提出跳跃步采样机制，直接跳过迭代生成过程中的多个中间去噪步骤，而非像标准传播推理那样步进式精炼。该方法演绎自与标准传播模型相同的训练目标，表明通过马尔可夫方式进行加速采样是预训练传播模型的内在特性。还将该加速采样技术与DDIM进行集成。

Result: 在OpenAI ADM、Stable Diffusion和Open Sora等流行预训练传播模型上进行了大量实验，结果显示该方法能够在显著减少采样步骤的情况下实现高质量生成。

Conclusion: 跳跃步采样是传播模型的内在特性，可以通过马尔可夫方式实现高效加速，而无需构建复杂的非马尔可夫过程。这为传播模型的实际应用提供了更加高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various
generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation
process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,
such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of
non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.
However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion
process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian
processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce
skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate
denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the
traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,
we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the
same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that
accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an
intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an
enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique
with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,
including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our
method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling
steps.

Abstract: We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression
paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language
model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from
limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making
them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the
evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i)
multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of
various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable
coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding
agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding
expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request,
mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first
dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding
annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for
intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests
efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile,
it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding
framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence
(AGI) in image compression.

Conclusion: 冗余分配策略通过数量丰富和几何多样化的拓扑监督，有效解决了现有方法监督范围有限的问题，显著提升了车道拓扑推理性能。

Abstract: Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by
modeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between
lanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a
first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are
supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the
detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology
reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this
paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology
reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.
Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the
cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane
predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many
assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with
independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.
Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology
reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic
topology performance.

Abstract: In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent
classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data.
However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and
structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying
comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead
to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more
reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP
models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications
with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique
characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware
classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions
for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness
of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification
and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,
which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by
offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that
DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent

Motivation: 超声视频中的先天性心脏病检测受图像噪声和探头位置变异性的影响，现有机器学习方法往往忽略时序信息、仅限于二元分类且缺乏预测校准。

Conclusion: TPA框架通过整合时序建模、提示感知对比学习和不确定性量化，显著提升了胎儿先天性心脏病超声视频分类的准确性和临床可靠性。

Abstract: Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by
image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can
reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect
temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not
account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA),
a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive
learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts
features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates
them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns
the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge
contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce
a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which
learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies
classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection
and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while
also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On
EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to
58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital
heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal
modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in
tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience.
Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the
inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D
reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball,
in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,
as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with
frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.
  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first
multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds
with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball
environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves
improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR
dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully
synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We
recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball
players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for
each player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that
leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method
consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAG-SEG是一种无需训练的两阶段伪装目标检测方法，通过检索增强生成粗掩码作为提示，再用SAM进行精细分割，在个人笔记本上实现与SOTA方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有伪装目标检测方法需要大量训练和计算资源，而基础模型如SAM需要高质量提示且难以直接处理COD任务，手动生成提示成本高效率低。

Method: 提出两阶段训练免费范式：第一阶段通过无监督聚类构建检索数据库进行特征检索生成粗掩码提示；第二阶段使用SAM2进行精细分割。

Result: 在基准COD数据集上的大量实验表明，RAG-SEG性能与或超越最先进方法，所有实验均在个人笔记本上完成，计算效率高。

Conclusion: RAG-SEG提供了一种高效实用的伪装目标检测解决方案，无需传统训练过程，在保持竞争力的同时显著降低了计算资源需求。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer
vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.
Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational
resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without
fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.
However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a
training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based
segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval
database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature
retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that
guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for
conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive
experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par
with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are
conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational
efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the
Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and
possible improvements.

TL;DR: VideoEraser是一个无需训练即可防止文本到视频扩散模型生成有害内容的即插即用框架，通过选择性提示嵌入调整和抗干扰噪声引导两阶段处理，在多个擦除任务中平均减少46%的不良内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到视频扩散模型可能被滥用来生成包含隐私侵犯、版权问题和有害内容的视频，这些模型通常使用未经授权的个人身份、艺术作品和有害材料进行训练，导致不良内容的不可控生产和传播。

Method: 提出VideoEraser框架，采用两阶段处理：1）选择性提示嵌入调整（SPEA）来修改文本提示的嵌入表示；2）抗干扰噪声引导（ARNG）来增强对不良概念的抑制。该框架无需额外训练，可直接集成到现有T2V扩散模型中。

Result: 在对象擦除、艺术风格擦除、名人擦除和显式内容擦除四个任务上进行了广泛评估，VideoEraser在效能、完整性、保真度、鲁棒性和泛化性方面均优于现有方法，平均减少46%的不良内容生成。

Conclusion: VideoEraser是一个有效的训练免费解决方案，能够显著抑制文本到视频扩散模型中不良内容的生成，为解决模型滥用问题提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns
about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in
generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on
numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic
creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and
distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a
training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating
videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those
concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly
integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:
Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise
Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including
object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content
erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms
prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and
generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in
suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on
average across four tasks compared to baselines.

vehicles are now reality in different parts of the world. These vehicles
require sensors and cameras to detect objects and maneuver according to that.
It becomes important to for such vehicles to also predict from a distant if a
person is about to cross a road or not. The current study focused on predicting
the intent of crossing the road by pedestrians in an experimental setup. The
study involved working with deep learning models to predict poses and sequence
modelling for temporal predictions. The study analysed three different sequence
modelling to understand the prediction behaviour and it was found out that GRU
was better in predicting the intent compared to LSTM model but 1D CNN was the
best model in terms of speed. The study involved video analysis, and the output
of pose detection model was integrated later on to sequence modelling
techniques for an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting road
crossing intents.

TL;DR: 本文通过注意力敲除技术系统分析了Video-LLMs的内部工作机制，发现视频信息主要在早期层提取，中间层存在关键异常层，且时空建模更多依赖语言引导检索而非视频token自注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Video-LLMs研究主要关注性能提升，对其内部机制理解有限，本文旨在通过系统实证研究填补这一空白。

Method: 采用注意力敲除作为主要分析工具，设计了三种敲除变体（时间、空间、语言到视频），并在不同层窗口上应用，设置了全局和细粒度两种分析设置。

Result: 发现视频信息提取主要在早期层完成，形成两阶段处理过程；某些中间层对视频问答有异常重要影响；时空建模更多依赖语言引导检索。这些见解可用于减少注意力计算。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统揭示Video-LLMs内部视频处理机制的工作，为未来研究提供了可解释性和效率提升的视角。

Abstract: Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video
Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering
video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,
with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper
aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret
existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool
and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and
Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different
numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of
layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a
fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting
indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,
forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,
while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,
certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question
answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute
minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling
relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame
self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational
cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce
attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand
video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法需要更新所有模型参数，可能导致过拟合和计算成本高。需要一种更高效的迁移学习方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 采用进化算法识别需要微调的层子集，专注于相关层进行微调，减少可训练参数数量。

Result: 在9个不同领域的图像分类数据集上评估，BioTune相比AutoRGN和LoRA等方法，在准确性和效率方面表现竞争性或更好。

Conclusion: 通过选择性层微调，BioTune降低了计算成本，促进了跨不同数据特征和分布的更高效迁移学习。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown substantial progress in image analysis. However, the
computational demands of large, fully trained models remain a consideration.
Transfer learning offers a strategy for adapting pre-trained models to new
tasks. Traditional fine-tuning often involves updating all model parameters,
which can potentially lead to overfitting and higher computational costs. This
paper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that
selectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune
employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for
fine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task.
Evaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains
indicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency
compared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By
concentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune
reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased
computational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across
diverse data characteristics and distributions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ICGS-Quantizer方法，通过联合利用高斯间和属性间相关性以及跨场景共享码本，将3DGS压缩到千字节级别，同时支持基于图像的场景更新解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS压缩方法存在两个限制：(1)只能将中等规模场景压缩到兆字节级别，对大规模场景或场景集合仍不实用；(2)缺乏处理长期归档后场景变化的机制。

Method: 提出图像条件高斯分布量化器(ICGS-Quantizer)，通过联合利用高斯间和属性间相关性、跨训练场景共享码本，并固定应用于未见测试场景，避免每场景码本开销。编码、量化和解码过程联合训练，支持基于解码时捕获图像的场景条件解码。

Result: 实验结果表明，ICGS-Quantizer在压缩效率和场景变化适应性方面持续优于最先进方法，将3DGS存储需求降低到千字节范围同时保持视觉保真度。

Conclusion: ICGS-Quantizer显著提升了压缩效率并为归档后场景变化提供了适应性，解决了现有3DGS压缩方法的局限性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: DriveSplat是一种基于神经高斯表示的动态-静态解耦方法，用于驾驶场景的高质量3D重建，通过区域体素初始化、可变形神经高斯和深度/法线先验监督，在Waymo和KITTI数据集上实现了最先进的新视角合成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于3D高斯泼溅的方法在处理驾驶场景时，虽然通过解耦动态和静态组件解决了运动模糊问题，但忽略了具有充分几何关系的背景优化，仅通过添加高斯来拟合每个训练视图，导致新视角渲染鲁棒性有限且缺乏准确的几何表示。

Method: 1) 采用区域体素初始化方案，将场景划分为近、中、远区域以增强近景细节表示；2) 引入可变形神经高斯来建模非刚性动态物体，通过可学习变形网络进行时间参数调整；3) 使用预训练模型的深度和法线先验对整个框架进行监督，提高几何结构准确性。

Result: 在Waymo和KITTI数据集上的严格评估表明，该方法在驾驶场景的新视角合成方面实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DriveSplat通过创新的动态-静态解耦策略、区域化初始化和几何先验监督，有效解决了驾驶场景3D重建中的挑战，为高质量新视角合成提供了强有力的解决方案。

Abstract: In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles,
pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant
challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static
components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook
background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on
fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit
limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric
representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a
high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural
Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate
the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise
voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near,
middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation.
Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors,
whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network.
The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from
pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method
has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在抽象推理方面存在根本性瓶颈，RPM问题被学术界作为评估抽象推理能力的权威基准。本文旨在通过解决RPM问题来提升机器智能的抽象推理能力。

Method: 采用因果链建模视角分析RPM任务的完整因果链，设计DIO基线模型网络架构。针对DIO模型的局限性（互信息下界紧致性问题和统计度量无法捕捉因果关系），逐步提出三种改进方法。

Result: 实验表明DIO模型的优化目标（最大化上下文与正确答案之间的互信息变分下界）无法让模型真正获得预定义的人类推理逻辑。

Conclusion: 需要克服互信息下界紧致性和统计度量局限性的问题，为此提出了三种渐进式改进方法来提升模型的抽象推理能力。

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across
various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains
unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced
Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for
evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,
with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,
pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers
on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract
reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a
``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete
causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes
$\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency
$\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture
of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the
optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational
lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,
fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning
logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound
significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and
mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal
relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this
paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

Result: 在SumMe、TVSum、VideoXum、QFVS等多个数据集上超越现有方法

Conclusion: SpiVG网络通过创新的脉冲神经网络和变分图推理方法，有效提升了视频摘要的信息密度和计算效率，解决了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: With the rise of short video content, efficient video summarization
techniques for extracting key information have become crucial. However,
existing methods struggle to capture the global temporal dependencies and
maintain the semantic coherence of video content. Additionally, these methods
are also influenced by noise during multi-channel feature fusion. We propose a
Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network, which enhances information density
and reduces computational complexity. First, we design a keyframe extractor
based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), leveraging the event-driven computation
mechanism of SNNs to learn keyframe features autonomously. To enable
fine-grained and adaptable reasoning across video frames, we introduce a
Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner, which decouples contextual object
consistency from semantic perspective coherence. We present a Variational
Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise arising during
multi-channel feature fusion. In this module, we employ Evidence Lower Bound
Optimization (ELBO) to capture the latent structure of multi-channel feature
distributions, using posterior distribution regularization to reduce
overfitting. Experimental results show that SpiVG surpasses existing methods
across multiple datasets such as SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS. Our codes
and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/liwrui/SpiVG.

Conclusion: 研究提供了关于如何在实际中选择MAE超参数的见解，帮助更好地理解MAE学习机制并指导超参数调优。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique
for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require
extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder
layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have
analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent
variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on
downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs
learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the
features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can
be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial
correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE
representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond
second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE
hyper-parameters in practice.

Conclusion: BIRD方法通过双向时间信息传播有效解决了现有滑动窗口方法的局限性，在红外小目标检测任务中表现出色

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search
and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent
years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the
information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the
detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do
not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global
temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant
computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small
target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy
simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and
global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.
Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design
a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal
dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global
Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the
global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the
bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head
for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the
traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)
loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only
achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference
speed.

Abstract: Conventional car damage inspection techniques are labor-intensive, manual,
and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents.
Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for
quicker and more precise inspection methods. The paper uses the YOLOv8 object
recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for
automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car
exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual,
time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve
this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under
various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve
robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and
YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.
Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy
and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as
automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation
parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and
F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of
0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4
model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying
microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the
mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve

YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent

TL;DR: MATR是一个基于Transformer的视频到视频时刻检索模型，通过双阶段序列对齐和自监督预训练，在ActivityNet-VRL和SportsMoments数据集上显著超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频到视频时刻检索任务需要解决语义帧级对齐和复杂依赖关系建模的挑战，现有方法在这方面存在不足。

Method: 提出MATR模型，使用基于Transformer的双阶段序列对齐机制来捕获语义上下文和时间细节，并采用自监督预训练技术来定位视频中的随机片段。

Result: 在ActivityNet-VRL数据集上R@1提升13.1%，mIoU提升8.1%；在SportsMoments数据集上R@1提升14.7%，mIoU提升14.4%。

Conclusion: MATR通过有效的序列对齐和预训练策略，在视频到视频时刻检索任务上取得了显著的性能提升，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen
events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses
several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and
modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this
challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a
transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the
temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions
target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence
alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These
representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and
boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in
the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to
provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to
localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU
on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular
ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset,
SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an
absolute scale over strong baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需SfM的3D高斯溅射方法，能够在极稀疏视角输入下联合估计相机位姿和重建3D场景，显著提升渲染质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3DGS方法严重依赖密集多视角输入和精确相机位姿，但在现实场景中这些条件往往难以满足，特别是在极稀疏视角下SfM方法会失效

Method: 使用密集立体模块替代SfM进行相机位姿估计和全局稠密点云重建；提出一致性视角插值模块生成额外监督信号；引入多尺度拉普拉斯一致性正则化和自适应空间感知多尺度几何正则化

Result: 在极稀疏视角条件下（仅使用2个训练视角）PSNR指标显著提升2.75dB，合成图像失真最小且保留丰富高频细节，视觉质量优于现有技术

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了极稀疏视角下3DGS的性能退化问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time
performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on
dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely
available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse,
the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization
fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,
resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs
3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we
propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose
information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To
address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view
settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates
camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent
content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we
introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive
spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of
geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches,
achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view
conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method
exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,
resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.

TL;DR: LGMSNet是一个轻量级医学图像分割框架，通过异构核和稀疏Transformer-卷积混合分支，在保持低计算开销的同时实现优异的全局上下文感知和零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有轻量级模型在医学图像分割中性能与效率的权衡问题，特别是缺乏全局上下文感知能力和通道冗余问题，以满足资源受限临床环境的需求。

Method: 提出LGMSNet框架：1) 使用异构层内核提取局部高频信息并减少通道冗余；2) 集成稀疏Transformer-卷积混合分支捕获低频全局信息。

Result: 在6个公共数据集上超越现有SOTA方法，在4个未见数据集上保持优异的零样本泛化性能，计算开销极小。

Conclusion: LGMSNet为资源有限的医疗场景提供了高效的解决方案，具有强大的实际部署潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings
where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture
low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public
datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot
generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for
real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios. The whole project
code is in https://github.com/cq-dong/LGMSNet.

Motivation: 现有的单视角方法ECON在3D人体重建方面存在局限性，需要扩展到多视角来提升几何精度和身体姿态估计的准确性

Method: 提出JMBO算法联合优化SMPL-X人体模型，确保多视角一致性；使用优化后的身体模型作为低频先验，通过法线图积分添加几何细节；整合前后视角的法线图来捕捉服装褶皱和发型等细节

Result: 实验结果表明MExECON相比单视角基线方法在保真度方面有显著提升，与现有的少样本3D重建方法相比具有竞争力

Conclusion: MExECON成功将单视角方法扩展到多视角场景，无需重新训练网络即可实现多视角优势，为穿衣人体3D重建提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: This work presents MExECON, a novel pipeline for 3D reconstruction of clothed
human avatars from sparse multi-view RGB images. Building on the single-view
method ECON, MExECON extends its capabilities to leverage multiple viewpoints,
improving geometry and body pose estimation. At the core of the pipeline is the
proposed Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm, which fits a
single SMPL-X body model jointly across all input views, enforcing multi-view
consistency. The optimized body model serves as a low-frequency prior that
guides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added
via normal map integration. MExECON integrates normal maps from both front and
back views to accurately capture fine-grained surface details such as clothing
folds and hairstyles. All multi-view gains are achieved without requiring any
network re-training. Experimental results show that MExECON consistently
improves fidelity over the single-view baseline and achieves competitive
performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

Motivation: 当前多模态图像融合方法面临模态不对齐、高频细节破坏和任务特定限制等挑战，需要一种通用且高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出AdaSFFuse框架，包含自适应近似小波变换(AdaWAT)进行频率解耦，以及空间-频率Mamba块进行跨域融合，实现多模态特征的对齐和整合。

Result: 在红外-可见光、多焦点、多曝光和医学图像融合四个任务上的实验表明，AdaSFFuse具有优越的融合性能，同时保持低计算成本和紧凑网络结构。

Conclusion: AdaSFFuse在性能和效率之间实现了良好平衡，为多模态图像融合提供了一个有效的通用解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary information
from different imaging modalities to overcome the limitations of individual
sensors. It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such
as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality
misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for
task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.
AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet
Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba
Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high-
and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes,
enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency
characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks
facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing
this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to
ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components,
AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features,
reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments
on four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image
Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF)
-- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low
computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between
performance and efficiency. The code will be publicly available at
https://github.com/Zhen-yu-Liu/AdaSFFuse.

Motivation: 现有方法利用生成先验作为伪真值，但往往导致几何一致性差和过度平滑的渲染效果，需要解决这些限制。

Method: 提出ExtraGS框架，包含基于混合高斯-SDF设计的道路表面高斯(RSG)表示、使用可学习缩放因子的远场高斯(FFG)，以及基于球谐函数的自监督不确定性估计框架。

Result: 在多个数据集、多样化多相机设置和各种生成先验上的广泛实验表明，ExtraGS显著提升了外推视图的真实性和几何一致性，同时在原始轨迹上保持高保真度。

Conclusion: ExtraGS通过整合几何和生成先验，有效解决了自动驾驶场景外推视图合成中的关键挑战，为模拟驾驶场景提供了高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for
simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a
challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground
truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed
renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic
framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and
generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG)
representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF)
design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to
efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised
uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables
selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts
occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups,
and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances
the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving
high fidelity along the original trajectory.

Motivation: 现有草图动画方法在处理多对象交互和复杂运动时存在局限，要么仅限于单对象情况，要么存在时间不一致性和泛化能力差的问题，需要一种能够有效处理这些复杂场景的方法。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1）运动初始化阶段交互式分割语义组并定义关键帧，通过插值生成粗略动画；2）运动细化阶段使用基于组的位移网络（GDN）预测组特定位移场，并利用文本到视频模型的先验知识，还包含上下文条件特征增强（CCFE）等专门模块来提高时间一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在生成高质量、时间一致的复杂多对象草图动画方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GroupSketch方法成功扩展了草图动画的实际应用范围，能够有效处理多对象交互和复杂运动场景。

Abstract: We introduce GroupSketch, a novel method for vector sketch animation that
effectively handles multi-object interactions and complex motions. Existing
approaches struggle with these scenarios, either being limited to single-object
cases or suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization. To
address these limitations, our method adopts a two-stage pipeline comprising
Motion Initialization and Motion Refinement. In the first stage, the input
sketch is interactively divided into semantic groups and key frames are
defined, enabling the generation of a coarse animation via interpolation. In
the second stage, we propose a Group-based Displacement Network (GDN), which
refines the coarse animation by predicting group-specific displacement fields,
leveraging priors from a text-to-video model. GDN further incorporates
specialized modules, such as Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE), to
improve temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality,
temporally consistent animations for complex, multi-object sketches, thus
expanding the practical applications of sketch animation.

TL;DR: D3FNet是一个用于高分辨率遥感影像中细粒度窄路分割的扩张双流差分注意力融合网络，通过三个关键创新解决窄路提取的挑战，在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率遥感影像中的窄路提取面临宽度有限、拓扑结构碎片化和频繁遮挡等挑战，传统模型容易对通用道路宽度过拟合，需要专门针对细粒度、遮挡和低对比度路段的方法。

Method: 基于D-LinkNet编码器-解码器架构，提出三个创新：1）差分注意力扩张提取模块增强细微道路特征并抑制背景噪声；2）双流解码融合机制整合原始和注意力调制特征；3）多尺度扩张策略减少网格伪影并改善连续性。

Result: 在DeepGlobe和CHN6-CUG基准测试中，D3FNet在具有挑战性的道路区域实现了优异的IoU和召回率，超越了最先进的基线方法。消融研究验证了注意力引导编码和双路径解码的互补协同作用。

Conclusion: D3FNet被证实为复杂遥感和协同感知场景中细粒度窄路提取的鲁棒解决方案，能够有效处理窄路的精细结构分割问题。

Abstract: Extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery remains a
significant challenge due to their limited width, fragmented topology, and
frequent occlusions. To address these issues, we propose D3FNet, a Dilated
Dual-Stream Differential Attention Fusion Network designed for fine-grained
road structure segmentation in remote perception systems. Built upon the
encoder-decoder backbone of D-LinkNet, D3FNet introduces three key
innovations:(1) a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module that
enhances subtle road features while suppressing background noise at the
bottleneck; (2) a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) that integrates
original and attention-modulated features to balance spatial precision with
semantic context; and (3) a multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1, 3, 5, 9)
that mitigates gridding artifacts and improves continuity in narrow road
prediction. Unlike conventional models that overfit to generic road widths,
D3FNet specifically targets fine-grained, occluded, and low-contrast road
segments. Extensive experiments on the DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks show
that D3FNet achieves superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies further verify the
complementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.
These results confirm D3FNet as a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road
extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios.

Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法存在两个主要问题：1）依赖反向传播或迭代优化，限制了可扩展性和实时部署；2）缺乏对类别条件特征分布的显式建模，影响决策边界可靠性和预测校准。

Method: 将测试时自适应重新构建为高斯概率推理任务，使用逐渐更新的类别均值和共享协方差矩阵建模类别条件似然，实现闭式、免训练推理。引入基于CLIP先验和历史知识库的轻量级正则化来纠正潜在似然偏差。

Result: 在多样化基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法在广泛的分布偏移范围内实现了最先进的性能，具有优越的可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ADAPT方法无需源数据、梯度更新或完整访问目标数据，支持在线和转导设置，为测试时自适应提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under
distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite
notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.
First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which
limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit
modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial
for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it
remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at
test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and
backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian
probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using
gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables
closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we
introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical
knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full
access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.
Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts
with superior scalability and robustness.

Motivation: 隐式神经表示(INRs)存在频谱偏差问题，神经网络倾向于学习低频成分而难以捕捉高频细节如锐利边缘和精细纹理。现有方法主要通过架构修改或特殊激活函数来解决，本文提出通过直接指导训练过程的新方向。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：1) 使用邻域感知软掩码自适应地为局部变化强烈的像素分配更高权重，鼓励模型早期关注精细细节；2) 过渡到全图像训练。这种方法能够频率感知地为像素分配重要性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法 consistently 改善重建质量，并且能够与现有的INR方法互补，有效提升高频细节的捕捉能力。

Conclusion: 作为在图像INR中为像素分配频率感知重要性的开创性尝试，本工作为缓解频谱偏差问题提供了新的途径，证明通过训练策略指导是解决该问题的有效正交方向。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative
to traditional pixel-based formats by modeling images as continuous functions
over spatial coordinates. A key challenge, however, lies in the spectral bias
of neural networks, which tend to favor low-frequency components while
struggling to capture high-frequency (HF) details such as sharp edges and fine
textures. While prior approaches have addressed this limitation through
architectural modifications or specialized activation functions, we propose an
orthogonal direction by directly guiding the training process. Specifically, we
introduce a two-stage training strategy where a neighbor-aware soft mask
adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations,
encouraging early focus on fine details. The model then transitions to
full-image training. Experimental results show that our approach consistently
improves reconstruction quality and complements existing INR methods. As a
pioneering attempt to assign frequency-aware importance to pixels in image INR,
our work offers a new avenue for mitigating the spectral bias problem.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了点云配准问题的求解效率，虽然目前还不能解决完整的6自由度问题，但在旋转轴已知的情况下表现出色

Abstract: Recent results showed that point cloud registration with given
correspondences can be made robust to outlier rates of up to 95\% using the
truncated least squares (TLS) formulation. However, solving this combinatorial
optimization problem to global optimality is challenging. Provably globally
optimal approaches using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations take
hundreds of seconds for 100 points. In this paper, we propose a novel linear
time convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and
Bound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to
provable global optimality in less than half a second when the axis of rotation
is provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is
two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when
solving the rotation-only TLS problem. In addition to providing a formal proof
for global optimality, we present empirical evidence of global optimality using
adversarial instances with local minimas close to the global minimum.

wildlife interactions and informing effective conservation planning.
Multiperspective monitoring of wildlife and human activities by combining
camera traps and drone imagery. Capturing the spatial patterns of their
distributions, which allows the identification of the overlap of their activity
zones and the assessment of the degree of human wildlife conflict. The study
was conducted in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal, and adjacent regions.
Images collected by visible and nearinfrared camera traps and thermal infrared
drones from February to July 2022 were processed to create training and testing
datasets, which were used to build deep learning models to automatic identify
wildlife and human activities. Drone collected thermal imagery was used for
detecting targets to provide a multiple monitoring perspective. Spatial pattern
analysis was performed to identify animal and resident activity hotspots and
delineation potential human wildlife conflict zones. Among the deep learning
models tested, YOLOv11s achieved the highest performance with a precision of
96.2%, recall of 92.3%, mAP50 of 96.7%, and mAP50 of 81.3%, making it the most
effective for detecting objects in camera trap imagery. Drone based thermal
imagery, analyzed with an enhanced Faster RCNN model, added a complementary
aerial viewpoint for camera trap detections. Spatial pattern analysis
identified clear hotspots for both wildlife and human activities and their
overlapping patterns within certain areas in the CNP and buffer zones
indicating potential conflict. This study reveals human wildlife conflicts
within the conserved landscape. Integrating multiperspective monitoring with
automated object detection enhances wildlife surveillance and landscape
management.

Motivation: 现有视频LLM在时间感知方面存在不足：时间戳编码隐式、帧级特征连续性捕捉能力弱、语言视觉对齐容易偏离感兴趣实体，需要更精确的时间定位和实体交互理解能力。

Conclusion: Grounded VideoDiT通过三个关键创新成功解决了视频LLM的时间感知局限性，为细粒度时间推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it
demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact
across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in
holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are
encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity,
and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In
this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome
these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion
Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains
temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind
query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a
mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp

TL;DR: 提出了一种弱监督方法，通过人工质量评级来改进机载激光扫描数据的树木实例分割，在正确识别树木实例方面提升了34%的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机载激光扫描数据的树木实例分割对森林监测至关重要，但面临数据变化大和精确标注数据获取成本高的问题

Method: 使用非微调模型或闭式算法获得初始分割结果，由人工操作员进行质量评级，训练评级模型对分割输出分类，最后利用评级模型的反馈微调分割模型

Result: 原始分割模型在正确识别树木实例方面提升了34%，同时显著减少了非树木实例的预测数量

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了弱监督下的树木分割问题，但在稀疏林区小树木和复杂环境中的性能仍有待提升

Abstract: Tree instance segmentation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is of utmost
importance for forest monitoring, but remains challenging due to variations in
the data caused by factors such as sensor resolution, vegetation state at
acquisition time, terrain characteristics, etc. Moreover, obtaining a
sufficient amount of precisely labeled data to train fully supervised instance
segmentation methods is expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a
weakly supervised approach where labels of an initial segmentation result
obtained either by a non-finetuned model or a closed form algorithm are
provided as a quality rating by a human operator. The labels produced during
the quality assessment are then used to train a rating model, whose task is to
classify a segmentation output into the same classes as specified by the human
operator. Finally, the segmentation model is finetuned using feedback from the
rating model. This in turn improves the original segmentation model by 34\% in
terms of correctly identified tree instances while considerably reducing the
number of non-tree instances predicted. Challenges still remain in data over
sparsely forested regions characterized by small trees (less than two meters in
height) or within complex surroundings containing shrubs, boulders, etc. which
can be confused as trees where the performance of the proposed method is
reduced.

TL;DR: 提出CFG方法，通过关键特征引导提升3D点云对抗样本的迁移性，在黑盒攻击场景下无需目标模型信息即可生成有效对抗样本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中难以获取目标模型信息，现有3D对抗攻击方法依赖模型参数或输出信息，需要开发不依赖目标模型信息的迁移攻击方法

Method: 基于不同DNN架构使用一致关键特征的观察，提出关键特征引导(CFG)方法，通过计算特征重要性来正则化对抗点云搜索，优先破坏跨架构通用的关键特征，并在损失函数中约束最大偏差以确保不可感知性

Result: 在ModelNet40和ScanObjectNN基准数据集上的大量实验表明，CFG方法大幅优于现有最先进的攻击方法

Conclusion: CFG方法通过关键特征引导有效提升了3D点云对抗样本的迁移攻击性能，为黑盒场景下的3D点云安全提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Deep neural networks for 3D point clouds have been demonstrated to be
vulnerable to adversarial examples. Previous 3D adversarial attack methods
often exploit certain information about the target models, such as model
parameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in
realistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the
target models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on
transfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not
require any information about the target models. Based on our observation that
the critical features used for point cloud classification are consistent across
different DNN architectures, we propose CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box
attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via
the proposed Critical Feature Guidance. Specifically, our method regularizes
the search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the
extracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are
likely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, we explicitly constrain
the maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the
loss function to ensure their imperceptibility. Extensive experiments conducted
on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

Conclusion: MapKD框架有效解决了跨模态知识转移问题，实现了高效、低成本的在线高清地图构建，为自动驾驶系统提供了实用的解决方案

Abstract: Online HD map construction is a fundamental task in autonomous driving
systems, aiming to acquire semantic information of map elements around the ego
vehicle based on real-time sensor inputs. Recently, several approaches have
achieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and
HD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale
offline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable
computational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a
knowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models
with prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student
model. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal
knowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)
paradigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with
SD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with
prior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge
transfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally,
we introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D
Patch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked
Semantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive
experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves
the student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously
accelerating inference speed. The code is available

TL;DR: CM2LoD3提出了一种基于冲突图(CMs)的自动化LoD3建筑模型重建方法，通过语义分割和纹理融合技术，有效解决了传统手动建模LoD3模型的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoD1和LoD2建筑模型缺乏详细的立面元素（如窗户、门等），而传统LoD3模型生成需要手动建模，难以大规模应用。需要自动化方法来重建包含详细立面元素的LoD3模型。

Method: 利用射线到模型先验分析获得的冲突图(CMs)，开发语义冲突图生成器(SCMG)生成合成CMs进行语义分割。通过置信度分数将纹理模型分割结果与CMs融合，提高分割性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，CM2LoD3方法在建筑开口分割和重建方面表现有效，通过不确定性感知的纹理分割融合实现了61%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法推动了自动化LoD3模型重建的进展，为可扩展和高效的三维城市建模铺平了道路。

Abstract: Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins,
and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2
building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements
essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this
limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and
underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual
modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,
CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models
leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.
Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs
with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map
Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured
models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase
segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in
segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with
uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research
contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving
the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling. Our project is available:

TL;DR: MDPR框架通过多维动态提示路由解决VLM在类别不平衡场景下的微调偏差问题，构建五维视觉语义知识库，在长尾基准测试中达到SOTA水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型在类别不平衡场景下微调时存在偏差，现有方法忽略了VLM预训练中固有的类别不平衡问题，导致下游任务中的偏差累积。

Method: 提出多维动态提示路由(MDPR)框架：构建包含五个视觉语义维度的综合知识库；通过动态路由机制对齐全局视觉类别、检索最优提示、平衡细粒度语义；通过logits融合获得稳定预测。

Result: 在CIFAR-LT、ImageNet-LT和Places-LT等长尾基准测试中取得了与当前SOTA方法相当的结果，动态路由计算开销极小。

Conclusion: MDPR为数据不平衡下的VLM微调提供了一个灵活高效的增强方案，消融研究证实了语义库对尾部类别的有效性。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from
bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language
models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic
information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs'
pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To
address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt
Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for
classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the
dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal
prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions
through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks,
including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves
comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm
the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our
dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible
and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

TL;DR: StreamMem是一种查询无关的KV缓存内存机制，用于流式视频理解，通过注意力分数压缩视觉token和通用查询token之间的KV缓存，在内存受限的长视频场景中实现高效问答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在处理长视频时存在内存和计算开销大的问题，现有视觉压缩方法需要提前编码整个视觉上下文或预先知道问题，这在长视频理解和多轮对话场景中不实用。

Method: 提出StreamMem方法，以流式方式编码新视频帧，使用视觉token和通用查询token之间的注意力分数压缩KV缓存，同时维持固定大小的KV内存。

Result: 在三个长视频理解和两个流式视频问答基准测试中，StreamMem在查询无关的KV缓存压缩方面达到最先进性能，并与查询感知压缩方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: StreamMem为长视频流式理解提供了一种高效的查询无关KV缓存压缩解决方案，在内存受限环境下表现出色。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos
remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and
attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs
substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression
methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or
having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video
understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose
StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video
understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming
manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens
and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable
efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios.
Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question
answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance
in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware
compression approaches.

Motivation: 当前生成视频建模方法主要依赖RGB信号，导致在长序列中对象结构和运动出现累积错误，需要解决长视频生成中的结构性和时间一致性问题。

Method: 提出WorldWeaver框架，联合预测感知条件和颜色信息，利用深度线索构建记忆库保存上下文信息，采用分段噪声调度训练预测组。

Conclusion: WorldWeaver通过统一的长时域建模方案，显著提升了长视频生成的时间一致性和质量，为生成视频建模提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative video modeling has made significant strides, yet ensuring
structural and temporal consistency over long sequences remains a challenge.
Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated
errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these
issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation
that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified
long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key
advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color
information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal
consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we
observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that
preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon
video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training
prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational
cost. Extensive experiments on both diffusion- and rectified flow-based models
demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldWeaver in reducing temporal drift and
improving the fidelity of generated videos.

Motivation: 基础视觉模型（如SAM）在计算病理学中展现出强大潜力，但在细粒度语义分割（如识别特定细胞亚型）方面存在挑战，需要减少标注工作量并提升分割精度。

Method: 采用全栈方法：1）分子赋能学习减少像素级标注需求；2）SAM适配器增强语义特异性；3）分子导向校正学习（MOCL）提升分割准确性。

Abstract: Purpose: Recent developments in computational pathology have been driven by
advances in Vision Foundation Models, particularly the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:
prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for
direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a
range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face
challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying
specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we
propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational
pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This
model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging
lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for
detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to
emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with
SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating
Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results
from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model
significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with
varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the
workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise
biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing
medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.

Motivation: 现有参数化人体模型由于训练数据多样性有限和建模假设限制，难以捕捉不同身体姿态和形状的细节变化，且内部骨骼与外部软组织之间存在问题依赖关系，限制了直接控制身体高度和骨骼长度的能力。

Method: 使用240个同步相机捕获的60万高分辨率扫描数据，显式解耦形状和骨骼基座，将网格表示基于人体骨骼，实现形状表达性和关键点拟合的独立控制。

Conclusion: ATLAS通过骨骼基础的显式解耦方法，提供了增强的形状表达能力、细粒度身体属性定制以及独立于外部软组织特征的关键点拟合能力，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across a
wide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by
learning a basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh
modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body
poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and
restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes
the external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal
skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic
dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct
control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present
ATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans
captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly
decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in
the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity,
fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent
of external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by
fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative
evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture
complex poses compared to linear models.

Abstract: 3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest

novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as
input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.
Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;
(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and
global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature
extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of
3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;
(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input
scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our
architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image
inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the
efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this
paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation,
potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity
to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process
inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading
to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing
instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by
formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual
tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the
adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present
VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as
a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text
instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise
edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the
source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot
effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this
gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects
scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer.
VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and
efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based
methods by 30\%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Moreover, it completes a
$512\times512$ editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\times$ faster than the
similarly sized UltraEdit. The models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实应用中，用户通常需要获得一组多样化的输出结果（如4-8张图像），但传统的独立采样方法往往产生冗余结果，限制了用户选择和创意探索。

Method: 将组推理建模为二次整数分配问题：候选输出作为图节点，选择子集以优化样本质量（一元项）同时最大化组多样性（二元项）。通过渐进式剪枝候选集来提高运行时效率。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法相比独立采样基线和最新推理算法，显著提高了组多样性和质量。框架可泛化到文本到图像、图像到图像、图像提示和视频生成等多种任务。

Conclusion: 该方法使生成模型能够将多个输出视为有凝聚力的组而非独立样本，为实际应用提供了更丰富的输出选择。

Abstract: Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent
inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality
of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often
presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where
independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices
and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group
inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of
samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment
problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected
to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity
(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively
prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to
scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent
sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes
across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image
prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple
outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

Conclusion: CineScale成功突破了预训练模型在高分辨率视觉生成方面的限制，为高质量高分辨率图像和视频生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically
trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and
constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate
high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have
explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential
higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these
methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive
patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency
information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training
resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the
accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference
paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various
issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we
propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods
that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens
the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop
state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of
higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.
Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning,
and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Generated
