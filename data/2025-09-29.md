<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有放射学报告生成方法在真实临床环境中的质量仍不足，而大型视觉语言模型在通用领域通过采用LLM训练策略取得了显著进展。

Method: 使用直接偏好优化(DPO)框架，通过随机对比采样构建训练对，无需额外训练数据、奖励模型或人工偏好标注。

Result: 在三个最先进模型上补充使用随机DPO后，临床性能指标提升了高达5%。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升放射学报告生成的准确性，且具有模型无关性，无需额外数据或复杂标注。

Abstract: Radiography Report Generation (RRG) has gained significant attention in
medical image analysis as a promising tool for alleviating the growing workload
of radiologists. However, despite numerous advancements, existing methods have
yet to achieve the quality required for deployment in real-world clinical
settings. Meanwhile, large Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable progress in the general domain by adopting training strategies
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as alignment
techniques. In this paper, we introduce a model-agnostic framework to enhance
RRG accuracy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our approach leverages
random contrastive sampling to construct training pairs, eliminating the need
for reward models or human preference annotations. Experiments on supplementing
three state-of-the-art models with our Random DPO show that our method improves
clinical performance metrics by up to 5%, without requiring any additional
training data.

### [2] [Improving Autism Detection with Multimodal Behavioral Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21352)
*William Saakyan,Matthias Norden,Lola Eversmann,Simon Kirsch,Muyu Lin,Simon Guendelman,Isabel Dziobek,Hanna Drimalla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多模态行为分析的自闭症谱系障碍(ASC)计算机辅助诊断方法，通过分析面部表情、声音韵律、头部运动、心率变异性和凝视行为，在168名ASC参与者和157名非自闭症参与者的标准化视频数据集上实现了74%的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自闭症计算机辅助诊断方法存在凝视特征性能差和缺乏现实世界泛化能力的问题，需要开发更有效的多模态分析方法来提高诊断准确性。

Method: 采用多模态分析方法，整合面部表情、声音韵律、头部运动、心率变异性和凝视行为特征，并引入了新的统计描述符来量化眼球凝视角度的变异性，使用晚期融合技术整合不同模态的信息。

Result: 新提出的凝视统计描述符将基于凝视的分类准确率从64%提升到69%，多模态融合后整体分类准确率达到74%，与临床研究中关于ASC凝视回避的发现相一致。

Conclusion: 研究表明基于视频的多模态行为分析具有开发可扩展的自闭症筛查工具的潜力，能够支持自闭症评估过程。

Abstract: Due to the complex and resource-intensive nature of diagnosing Autism
Spectrum Condition (ASC), several computer-aided diagnostic support methods
have been proposed to detect autism by analyzing behavioral cues in patient
video data. While these models show promising results on some datasets, they
struggle with poor gaze feature performance and lack of real-world
generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we analyze a standardized video
dataset comprising 168 participants with ASC (46% female) and 157 non-autistic
participants (46% female), making it, to our knowledge, the largest and most
balanced dataset available. We conduct a multimodal analysis of facial
expressions, voice prosody, head motion, heart rate variability (HRV), and gaze
behavior. To address the limitations of prior gaze models, we introduce novel
statistical descriptors that quantify variability in eye gaze angles, improving
gaze-based classification accuracy from 64% to 69% and aligning computational
findings with clinical research on gaze aversion in ASC. Using late fusion, we
achieve a classification accuracy of 74%, demonstrating the effectiveness of
integrating behavioral markers across multiple modalities. Our findings
highlight the potential for scalable, video-based screening tools to support
autism assessment.

### [3] [KV-Efficient VLA: A Method of Speed up Vision Language Model with RNN-Gated Chunked KV Cache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21354)
*Wanshun Xu,Long Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KV-Efficient VLA是一个模型无关的内存压缩框架，通过选择性保留高价值上下文来解决VLA模型在长时推理中的KV内存增长问题，实现推理加速和内存减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在统一机器人感知和控制方面有潜力，但其可扩展性受到注意力二次成本和长时推理中KV内存无限增长的制约。现有方法虽然通过扩展骨干架构改善泛化能力，但往往忽略了实时部署所需的关键推理效率问题。

Method: 提出KV-Efficient VLA框架，将KV缓存划分为固定大小的块，使用循环门控模块根据学习的效用分数来总结和过滤历史上下文。该设计保留最近的细粒度细节，同时积极修剪过时、低相关性的内存，同时保持因果性。

Result: 理论上，KV-Efficient VLA可实现高达1.21倍的推理加速和36%的KV内存减少，对任务成功率影响最小。该方法可无缝集成到现有的自回归和混合VLA堆栈中。

Conclusion: KV-Efficient VLA为VLA模型提供了可扩展的推理解决方案，无需修改训练流程或下游控制逻辑，解决了长时推理中的内存效率问题。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models promise unified robotic perception and
control, yet their scalability is constrained by the quadratic cost of
attention and the unbounded growth of key-value (KV) memory during long-horizon
inference. While recent methods improve generalization through scaling backbone
architectures, they often neglect the inference inefficiencies critical to
real-time deployment. In this work, we present KV-Efficient VLA, a
model-agnostic memory compression framework that addresses these limitations by
introducing a lightweight, training-friendly mechanism to selectively retain
high-utility context. Our method partitions the KV cache into fixed size chunks
and employs a recurrent gating module to summarize and filter historical
context according to learned utility scores. This design preserves recent
fine-grained detail while aggressively pruning stale, low-relevance memory, all
while maintaining causality. Theoretically, KV-Efficient VLA yields up to 1.21x
inference speedup and 36% KV memory reduction, with minimal impact on task
success. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing autoregressive and
hybrid VLA stacks, enabling scalable inference without modifying training
pipelines or downstream control logic.

### [4] [Phrase-grounded Fact-checking for Automatically Generated Chest X-ray Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21356)
*Razi Mahmood,Diego Machado-Reyes,Joy Wu,Parisa Kaviani,Ken C. L. Wong,Niharika D'Souza,Mannudeep Kalra,Ge Wang,Pingkun Yan,Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于短语定位的事实核查模型，用于检测自动生成的胸部X光报告中描述和位置的错误，通过合成数据集和多标签跨模态对比回归网络实现高精度验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉语言模型能生成逼真的放射学报告，但存在事实错误和幻觉问题，阻碍了临床应用，需要有效的事实核查方法。

Method: 通过扰动真实报告中的描述和位置创建合成数据集，训练多标签跨模态对比回归网络来检测报告中的错误。

Result: 在多个X光数据集上验证了方法的鲁棒性，对最先进报告生成器的错误检测与基于真实标注的验证结果高度一致（相关系数0.997）。

Conclusion: 该方法在放射学工作流程中具有临床应用价值，能有效检测自动生成报告中的事实错误。

Abstract: With the emergence of large-scale vision language models (VLM), it is now
possible to produce realistic-looking radiology reports for chest X-ray images.
However, their clinical translation has been hampered by the factual errors and
hallucinations in the produced descriptions during inference. In this paper, we
present a novel phrase-grounded fact-checking model (FC model) that detects
errors in findings and their indicated locations in automatically generated
chest radiology reports.
  Specifically, we simulate the errors in reports through a large synthetic
dataset derived by perturbing findings and their locations in ground truth
reports to form real and fake findings-location pairs with images. A new
multi-label cross-modal contrastive regression network is then trained on this
dataset. We present results demonstrating the robustness of our method in terms
of accuracy of finding veracity prediction and localization on multiple X-ray
datasets. We also show its effectiveness for error detection in reports of SOTA
report generators on multiple datasets achieving a concordance correlation
coefficient of 0.997 with ground truth-based verification, thus pointing to its
utility during clinical inference in radiology workflows.

### [5] [MDF-MLLM: Deep Fusion Through Cross-Modal Feature Alignment for Contextually Aware Fundoscopic Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21358)
*Jason Jordan,Mohammadreza Akbari Lor,Peter Koulen,Mei-Ling Shyu,Shu-Ching Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MDF-MLLM多模态深度学习架构，通过融合视网膜眼底图像的细粒度特征和全局文本上下文，显著提升疾病分类准确率，在双类型疾病分类任务中达到94%准确率，比基线提升56%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型难以捕捉诊断视网膜疾病所需的关键低层次空间细节，如青光眼、糖尿病视网膜病变和视网膜色素变性等。

Method: MDF-MLLM将U-Net编码器四层的跳跃特征集成到LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM的交叉注意力块中，通过补丁级投影、缩放交叉注意力和基于FiLM的U-Net调制进行视觉特征融合。

Result: 在1,305个眼底图像-文本对数据集上，MDF-MLLM达到94%准确率，比基线60%提升56%；召回率和F1分数分别提升67%和35%。

Conclusion: MDF-MLLM为眼底图像分类提供了一个可泛化、可解释和模块化的框架，通过多尺度特征融合优于传统MLLM基线，有望在临床决策支持系统中部署。

Abstract: This study aimed to enhance disease classification accuracy from retinal
fundus images by integrating fine-grained image features and global textual
context using a novel multimodal deep learning architecture. Existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to capture low-level
spatial details critical for diagnosing retinal diseases such as glaucoma,
diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. This model development and
validation study was conducted on 1,305 fundus image-text pairs compiled from
three public datasets (FIVES, HRF, and StoneRounds), covering acquired and
inherited retinal diseases, and evaluated using classification accuracy and
F1-score. The MDF-MLLM integrates skip features from four U-Net encoder layers
into cross-attention blocks within a LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM. Vision features are
patch-wise projected and fused using scaled cross-attention and FiLM-based
U-Net modulation. Baseline MLLM achieved 60% accuracy on the dual-type disease
classification task. MDF-MLLM, with both U-Net and MLLM components fully
fine-tuned during training, achieved a significantly higher accuracy of 94%,
representing a 56% improvement. Recall and F1-scores improved by as much as 67%
and 35% over baseline, respectively. Ablation studies confirmed that the
multi-depth fusion approach contributed to substantial gains in spatial
reasoning and classification, particularly for inherited diseases with rich
clinical text. MDF-MLLM presents a generalizable, interpretable, and modular
framework for fundus image classification, outperforming traditional MLLM
baselines through multi-scale feature fusion. The architecture holds promise
for real-world deployment in clinical decision support systems. Future work
will explore synchronized training techniques, a larger pool of diseases for
more generalizability, and extending the model for segmentation tasks.

### [6] [Multimodal Prompt Decoupling Attack on the Safety Filters in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21360)
*Xingkai Peng,Jun Jiang,Meng Tong,Shuai Li,Weiming Zhang,Nenghai Yu,Kejiang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出多模态提示解耦攻击(MPDA)，利用图像模态分离不安全提示的有害语义成分，通过LLM解耦和重写绕过T2I模型的安全过滤器生成NSFW内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱方法主要操纵文本提示，对基于图像的输入漏洞探索不足，且文本方法难以绕过模型安全过滤器。

Method: 1) LLM将不安全提示解耦为伪安全提示和有害提示；2) LLM重写有害提示为自然对抗提示；3) 视觉语言模型生成图像描述，指导LLM迭代重写和优化生成内容。

Result: MPDA能够有效绕过T2I模型的安全过滤器，生成与原始不安全提示语义一致的NSFW图像。

Conclusion: MPDA揭示了T2I模型在图像模态输入下的安全漏洞，为多模态安全研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have been widely applied in generating
high-fidelity images across various domains. However, these models may also be
abused to produce Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content via jailbreak attacks.
Existing jailbreak methods primarily manipulate the textual prompt, leaving
potential vulnerabilities in image-based inputs largely unexplored. Moreover,
text-based methods face challenges in bypassing the model's safety filters. In
response to these limitations, we propose the Multimodal Prompt Decoupling
Attack (MPDA), which utilizes image modality to separate the harmful semantic
components of the original unsafe prompt. MPDA follows three core steps:
firstly, a large language model (LLM) decouples unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe
prompts and harmful prompts. The former are seemingly harmless sub-prompts that
can bypass filters, while the latter are sub-prompts with unsafe semantics that
trigger filters. Subsequently, the LLM rewrites the harmful prompts into
natural adversarial prompts to bypass safety filters, which guide the T2I model
to modify the base image into an NSFW output. Finally, to ensure semantic
consistency between the generated NSFW images and the original unsafe prompts,
the visual language model generates image captions, providing a new pathway to
guide the LLM in iterative rewriting and refining the generated content.

### [7] [A Mutual Learning Method for Salient Object Detection with intertwined Multi-Supervision--Revised](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21363)
*Runmin Wu,Mengyang Feng,Wenlong Guan,Dong Wang,Huchuan Lu,Errui Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种通过联合利用显著目标检测、前景轮廓检测和边缘检测监督来训练显著性检测网络的方法，使用相互学习模块提升性能，在多个数据集上达到最先进水平


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习方法在显著性检测中存在的预测不完整和边界不准确问题，这些问题的产生源于目标内部复杂性和卷积池化操作中的步幅

Method: 使用相互交织的显著目标检测和前景轮廓检测任务生成均匀高亮的显著性图，同时让前景轮廓和边缘检测任务相互引导，并开发了相互学习模块(MLM)作为核心构建块

Result: 在7个具有挑战性的数据集上进行广泛实验，证明该方法在显著目标检测和边缘检测方面都取得了最先进的结果

Conclusion: 通过多任务监督和相互学习机制，有效提升了显著性检测的完整性和边界精度

Abstract: Though deep learning techniques have made great progress in salient object
detection recently, the predicted saliency maps still suffer from incomplete
predictions due to the internal complexity of objects and inaccurate boundaries
caused by strides in convolution and pooling operations. To alleviate these
issues, we propose to train saliency detection networks by exploiting the
supervision from not only salient object detection, but also foreground contour
detection and edge detection. First, we leverage salient object detection and
foreground contour detection tasks in an intertwined manner to generate
saliency maps with uniform highlight. Second, the foreground contour and edge
detection tasks guide each other simultaneously, thereby leading to precise
foreground contour prediction and reducing the local noises for edge
prediction. In addition, we develop a novel mutual learning module (MLM) which
serves as the building block of our method. Each MLM consists of multiple
network branches trained in a mutual learning manner, which improves the
performance by a large margin. Extensive experiments on seven challenging
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has delivered state-of-the-art
results in both salient object detection and edge detection.

### [8] [MAJORScore: A Novel Metric for Evaluating Multimodal Relevance via Joint Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21365)
*Zhicheng Du,Qingyang Shi,Jiasheng Lu,Yingshan Liang,Xinyu Zhang,Yiran Wang,Peiwu Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MAJORScore，一种全新的多模态相关性评估指标，适用于三个及以上模态的相关性分析，通过多模态联合表示实现公平评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态相关性评估指标主要基于双模态数据的预训练对比学习模型，仅适用于两种模态的关联分析，限制了多模态相似性评估的能力。

Method: 利用多模态联合表示将多个模态整合到同一潜在空间中，实现在同一尺度上准确表示不同模态，为公平相关性评分提供支持。

Result: 实验表明，MAJORScore在一致性模态上比现有方法提升26.03%-64.29%，在不一致性模态上降低13.28%-20.54%。

Conclusion: MAJORScore可作为大规模多模态数据集相似性评估和多模态模型性能评估的更可靠指标。

Abstract: The multimodal relevance metric is usually borrowed from the embedding
ability of pretrained contrastive learning models for bimodal data, which is
used to evaluate the correlation between cross-modal data (e.g., CLIP).
However, the commonly used evaluation metrics are only suitable for the
associated analysis between two modalities, which greatly limits the evaluation
of multimodal similarity. Herein, we propose MAJORScore, a brand-new evaluation
metric for the relevance of multiple modalities ($N$ modalities, $N\ge3$) via
multimodal joint representation for the first time. The ability of multimodal
joint representation to integrate multiple modalities into the same latent
space can accurately represent different modalities at one scale, providing
support for fair relevance scoring. Extensive experiments have shown that
MAJORScore increases by 26.03%-64.29% for consistent modality and decreases by
13.28%-20.54% for inconsistence compared to existing methods. MAJORScore serves
as a more reliable metric for evaluating similarity on large-scale multimodal
datasets and multimodal model performance evaluation.

### [9] [Safety Assessment of Scaffolding on Construction Site using AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21368)
*Sameer Prabhu,Amit Patwardhan,Ramin Karim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发基于AI的云平台，利用点云数据自动检测脚手架结构变化，提高安全检查效率和准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统脚手架安全检查依赖人工视觉检查，耗时且易出错，存在安全隐患

Method: 开发云AI平台处理点云数据，通过对比认证参考数据和最新点云数据来检测结构变化

Result: 系统能够自动监测脚手架结构变化，减少人工检查时间和精力

Conclusion: AI和数字化方法可以显著提高脚手架安全检查的效率和安全性

Abstract: In the construction industry, safety assessment is vital to ensure both the
reliability of assets and the safety of workers. Scaffolding, a key structural
support asset requires regular inspection to detect and identify alterations
from the design rules that may compromise the integrity and stability. At
present, inspections are primarily visual and are conducted by site manager or
accredited personnel to identify deviations. However, visual inspection is
time-intensive and can be susceptible to human errors, which can lead to unsafe
conditions. This paper explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
digitization to enhance the accuracy of scaffolding inspection and contribute
to the safety improvement. A cloud-based AI platform is developed to process
and analyse the point cloud data of scaffolding structure. The proposed system
detects structural modifications through comparison and evaluation of certified
reference data with the recent point cloud data. This approach may enable
automated monitoring of scaffolding, reducing the time and effort required for
manual inspections while enhancing the safety on a construction site.

### [10] [Automated Prompt Generation for Creative and Counterfactual Text-to-image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21375)
*Aleksa Jelaca,Ying Jiao,Chang Tian,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动提示工程框架，用于生成反事实尺寸的图像（如小海象配大按钮），通过图像评估器、监督提示重写器和DPO训练的排序器来优化提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大规模多模态训练推动了文本到图像生成的进步，但细粒度可控性仍是一个关键挑战。反事实可控性（生成违背常识模式的图像）对于创造性和探索性应用至关重要。

Method: 构建了首个反事实尺寸文本图像数据集，包含三个组件：扩展Grounded SAM的图像评估器用于指导数据集构建，监督提示重写器生成修订提示，DPO训练的排序器选择最优修订提示。

Result: 图像评估器相比其骨干网络提升了114%的性能，实验表明该方法优于最先进的基线和ChatGPT-4o。

Conclusion: 该方法为反事实可控性的未来研究奠定了基础，在反事实图像生成方面表现出色。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has advanced rapidly with large-scale multimodal
training, yet fine-grained controllability remains a critical challenge.
Counterfactual controllability, defined as the capacity to deliberately
generate images that contradict common-sense patterns, remains a major
challenge but plays a crucial role in enabling creativity and exploratory
applications. In this work, we address this gap with a focus on counterfactual
size (e.g., generating a tiny walrus beside a giant button) and propose an
automatic prompt engineering framework that adapts base prompts into revised
prompts for counterfactual images. The framework comprises three components: an
image evaluator that guides dataset construction by identifying successful
image generations, a supervised prompt rewriter that produces revised prompts,
and a DPO-trained ranker that selects the optimal revised prompt. We construct
the first counterfactual size text-image dataset and enhance the image
evaluator by extending Grounded SAM with refinements, achieving a 114 percent
improvement over its backbone. Experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ChatGPT-4o, establishing a
foundation for future research on counterfactual controllability.

*Shiraz S Kaderuppan,Jonathan Mar,Andrew Irvine,Anurag Sharma,Muhammad Ramadan Saifuddin,Wai Leong Eugene Wong,Wai Lok Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了两种深度神经网络架构(O-Net和Theta-Net)在非荧光相位调制显微镜下实现超分辨率成像的性能，发现它们在不同信噪比条件下具有互补性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统光学显微镜分辨率限制(~200nm)的问题，避免使用昂贵的专用设备或荧光超分辨率技术，为普通显微镜用户提供经济可行的超分辨率解决方案。

Method: 使用两种自研的深度神经网络架构(O-Net和Theta-Net)，在Zernike相位对比和微分干涉对比显微镜模式下，对通过原子力显微镜校准的纳米级特征测试靶进行超分辨率重建。

Result: 两种网络在超分辨率重建中表现良好但具有互补性：高信噪比图像适合O-Net模型，低信噪比图像更适合Theta-Net模型。

Conclusion: 模型架构和源图像信噪比对深度神经网络在非荧光光学纳米显微镜中的性能至关重要，即使使用相同的训练数据和训练周期，不同架构在不同条件下表现各异。

Abstract: The field of optical microscopy spans across numerous industries and research
domains, ranging from education to healthcare, quality inspection and analysis.
Nonetheless, a key limitation often cited by optical microscopists refers to
the limit of its lateral resolution (typically defined as ~200nm), with
potential circumventions involving either costly external modules (e.g.
confocal scan heads, etc) and/or specialized techniques [e.g. super-resolution
(SR) fluorescent microscopy]. Addressing these challenges in a normal
(non-specialist) context thus remains an aspect outside the scope of most
microscope users & facilities. This study thus seeks to evaluate an alternative
& economical approach to achieving SR optical microscopy, involving
non-fluorescent phase-modulated microscopical modalities such as Zernike phase
contrast (PCM) and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Two in
silico deep neural network (DNN) architectures which we developed previously
(termed O-Net and Theta-Net) are assessed on their abilities to resolve a
custom-fabricated test target containing nanoscale features calibrated via
atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of our study demonstrate that
although both O-Net and Theta-Net seemingly performed well when super-resolving
these images, they were complementary (rather than competing) approaches to be
considered for image SR, particularly under different image signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs). High image SNRs favoured the application of O-Net models, while
low SNRs inclined preferentially towards Theta-Net models. These findings
demonstrate the importance of model architectures (in conjunction with the
source image SNR) on model performance and the SR quality of the generated
images where DNN models are utilized for non-fluorescent optical nanoscopy,
even where the same training dataset & number of epochs are being used.

*Yinfeng Yu,Hailong Zhang,Meiling Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DMTF-AVN方法，通过多目标架构和精炼Transformer机制实现视听融合导航，在Replica和Matterport3D数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视听导航方法仅进行基础的多模态融合，忽略了更深层次的感知上下文信息，需要更有效的跨模态信息融合策略。

Method: 使用多目标架构配合精炼Transformer机制，对跨模态信息进行过滤和选择性融合。

Result: 在Replica和Matterport3D数据集上实现了最先进的性能，在成功率(SR)、路径效率(SPL)和场景适应性(SNA)方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法展现了强大的可扩展性和泛化能力，为机器人导航中的高级多模态融合策略开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Audiovisual embodied navigation enables robots to locate audio sources by
dynamically integrating visual observations from onboard sensors with the
auditory signals emitted by the target. The core challenge lies in effectively
leveraging multimodal cues to guide navigation. While prior works have explored
basic fusion of visual and audio data, they often overlook deeper perceptual
context. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Multi-Target Fusion for
Efficient Audio-Visual Navigation (DMTF-AVN). Our approach uses a multi-target
architecture coupled with a refined Transformer mechanism to filter and
selectively fuse cross-modal information. Extensive experiments on the Replica
and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that DMTF-AVN achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in success rate (SR), path
efficiency (SPL), and scene adaptation (SNA). Furthermore, the model exhibits
strong scalability and generalizability, paving the way for advanced multimodal
fusion strategies in robotic navigation. The code and videos are available at

### [13] [SAEmnesia: Erasing Concepts in Diffusion Models with Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21379)
*Enrico Cassano,Riccardo Renzulli,Marco Nurisso,Mirko Zaffaroni,Alan Perotti,Marco Grangetto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAEmnesia是一种监督式稀疏自编码器训练方法，通过系统化的概念标注促进概念与神经元的一对一映射，显著减少文本到图像扩散模型中概念遗忘所需的超参数搜索量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像扩散模型的概念遗忘需要精确定位概念在潜在空间中的表示，但即使使用稀疏自编码器减少神经元多义性，单个概念表示仍可能分布在多个潜在特征上，需要大量搜索过程。

Method: 引入SAEmnesia方法，通过系统化概念标注训练监督式稀疏自编码器，缓解特征分裂并促进特征集中化，学习具有更强概念关联的专用神经元。

Result: 在推理时，这种可解释表示将超参数搜索减少了96.67%；在UnlearnCanvas基准测试中，相比最先进方法提升了9.22%；在顺序遗忘任务中，9对象移除的遗忘准确率提升了28.4%。

Conclusion: SAEmnesia通过促进概念与神经元的一对一映射，显著提高了文本到图像扩散模型概念遗忘的效率和准确性，具有优越的可扩展性。

Abstract: Effective concept unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models requires
precise localization of concept representations within the model's latent
space. While sparse autoencoders successfully reduce neuron polysemanticity
(i.e., multiple concepts per neuron) compared to the original network,
individual concept representations can still be distributed across multiple
latent features, requiring extensive search procedures for concept unlearning.
We introduce SAEmnesia, a supervised sparse autoencoder training method that
promotes one-to-one concept-neuron mappings through systematic concept
labeling, mitigating feature splitting and promoting feature centralization.
Our approach learns specialized neurons with significantly stronger concept
associations compared to unsupervised baselines. The only computational
overhead introduced by SAEmnesia is limited to cross-entropy computation during
training. At inference time, this interpretable representation reduces
hyperparameter search by 96.67% with respect to current approaches. On the
UnlearnCanvas benchmark, SAEmnesia achieves a 9.22% improvement over the
state-of-the-art. In sequential unlearning tasks, we demonstrate superior
scalability with a 28.4% improvement in unlearning accuracy for 9-object
removal.

TL;DR: 提出了一种智能轻量级的核心集选择方法，通过提取类内多样性形成每类聚类来进行采样，以解决深度学习模型训练中计算资源需求大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在生物医学图像分类中需要大量计算资源和时间，特别是在超参数搜索时。随机采样方法在代表性方面存在不足，尤其对于不平衡数据集会偏向主导类别，且无法捕捉类内多样性。

Abstract: Deep Learning models have transformed various domains, including the
healthcare sector, particularly biomedical image classification by learning
intricate features and enabling accurate diagnostics pertaining to complex
diseases. Recent studies have adopted two different approaches to train DL
models: training from scratch and transfer learning. Both approaches demand
substantial computational time and resources due to the involvement of massive
datasets in model training. These computational demands are further increased
due to the design-space exploration required for selecting optimal
hyperparameters, which typically necessitates several training rounds. With the
growing sizes of datasets, exploring solutions to this problem has recently
gained the research community's attention. A plausible solution is to select a
subset of the dataset for training and hyperparameter search. This subset,
referred to as the corset, must be a representative set of the original
dataset. A straightforward approach to selecting the coreset could be employing
random sampling, albeit at the cost of compromising the representativeness of
the original dataset. A critical limitation of random sampling is the bias
towards the dominant classes in an imbalanced dataset. Even if the dataset has
inter-class balance, this random sampling will not capture intra-class
diversity. This study addresses this issue by introducing an intelligent,
lightweight mechanism for coreset selection. Specifically, it proposes a method
to extract intra-class diversity, forming per-class clusters that are utilized
for the final sampling. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology
by conducting extensive classification experiments on a well-known biomedical
imaging dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the
random sampling approach on several performance metrics for uniform conditions.

*Manel Rakez,Thomas Louis,Julien Guillaumin,Foucauld Chamming's,Pierre Fillard,Brice Amadeo,Virginie Rondeau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongiMam是一个端到端的深度学习模型，通过整合当前和最多四个既往乳腺X光片来改进乳腺癌风险预测，在真实世界不平衡数据中表现优于单次检查模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数深度学习模型仅使用单次或有限次数的既往乳腺X光片，且缺乏对真实世界不平衡结果分布和异质性随访的适应性。

Method: 开发LongiMam模型，结合卷积神经网络和循环神经网络来捕捉预测乳腺癌的空间和时间模式，使用大规模人群筛查数据集进行训练和评估。

Result: 在多种场景下，包含既往乳腺X光片的LongiMam模型始终优于单次检查模型，特别是在乳腺密度随时间变化的女性中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 纵向建模增强了乳腺癌预测能力，支持在筛查项目中使用重复乳腺X光片来改进风险分层。LongiMam已作为开源软件公开提供。

Abstract: Risk-adapted breast cancer screening requires robust models that leverage
longitudinal imaging data. Most current deep learning models use single or
limited prior mammograms and lack adaptation for real-world settings marked by
imbalanced outcome distribution and heterogeneous follow-up. We developed
LongiMam, an end-to-end deep learning model that integrates both current and up
to four prior mammograms. LongiMam combines a convolutional and a recurrent
neural network to capture spatial and temporal patterns predictive of breast
cancer. The model was trained and evaluated using a large, population-based
screening dataset with disproportionate case-to-control ratio typical of
clinical screening. Across several scenarios that varied in the number and
composition of prior exams, LongiMam consistently improved prediction when
prior mammograms were included. The addition of prior and current visits
outperformed single-visit models, while priors alone performed less well,
highlighting the importance of combining historical and recent information.
Subgroup analyses confirmed the model's efficacy across key risk groups,
including women with dense breasts and those aged 55 years or older. Moreover,
the model performed best in women with observed changes in mammographic density
over time. These findings demonstrate that longitudinal modeling enhances
breast cancer prediction and support the use of repeated mammograms to refine
risk stratification in screening programs. LongiMam is publicly available as
open-source software.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了CNN在复杂社会认知任务（图像情感评估）中与人类大脑处理的对齐程度，发现CNN难以超越简单视觉处理，无法反映高阶大脑处理，并提出了Object2Brain框架来分析不同对象类别对CNN-人类相关性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索CNN与人类大脑在复杂社会认知任务（而非一般视觉感知）中的对应关系，特别是图像情感评估这一更高阶的认知过程。

Method: 通过相关性分析评估CNN架构与人类行为和fMRI数据的对齐程度，并提出了Object2Brain框架，结合GradCAM和对象检测来分析不同对象类别对相关性的影响。

Result: CNN在图像情感评估任务中难以超越简单视觉处理，无法反映高阶大脑处理；不同CNN架构显示出不同的对象类别敏感性，尽管相关性趋势相似。

Conclusion: CNN在复杂社会认知任务中与人类大脑处理的对应关系有限，主要停留在简单视觉处理层面，无法充分反映更高阶的认知过程。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a popular type of computer model
that have proven their worth in many computer vision tasks. Moreover, they form
an interesting study object for the field of psychology, with shown
correspondences between the workings of CNNs and the human brain. However,
these correspondences have so far mostly been studied in the context of general
visual perception. In contrast, this paper explores to what extent this
correspondence also holds for a more complex brain process, namely social
cognition. To this end, we assess the alignment between popular CNN
architectures and both human behavioral and fMRI data for image valence
appraisal through a correlation analysis. We show that for this task CNNs
struggle to go beyond simple visual processing, and do not seem to reflect
higher-order brain processing. Furthermore, we present Object2Brain, a novel
framework that combines GradCAM and object detection at the CNN-filter level
with the aforementioned correlation analysis to study the influence of
different object classes on the CNN-to-human correlations. Despite similar
correlation trends, different CNN architectures are shown to display different
object class sensitivities.

### [17] [Debugging Concept Bottleneck Models through Removal and Retraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21385)
*Eric Enouen,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个可解释的调试框架CBDebug，通过移除和重训练两个步骤来纠正概念瓶颈模型中的系统性偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念干预方法无法解决模型与专家推理之间的系统性偏差问题，比如模型从有偏数据中学习捷径。

Method: 采用移除和重训练两步骤框架：移除步骤让专家识别并删除不需要的概念；重训练步骤使用CBDebug方法将概念级反馈转换为样本级辅助标签，应用监督偏差缓解和针对性增强。

Result: CBDebug在多个CBM架构和基准测试中显著优于先前的重训练方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效减少了模型对不需要概念的依赖，提升了概念瓶颈模型的可靠性和可解释性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) use a set of human-interpretable concepts to
predict the final task label, enabling domain experts to not only validate the
CBM's predictions, but also intervene on incorrect concepts at test time.
However, these interventions fail to address systemic misalignment between the
CBM and the expert's reasoning, such as when the model learns shortcuts from
biased data. To address this, we present a general interpretable debugging
framework for CBMs that follows a two-step process of Removal and Retraining.
In the Removal step, experts use concept explanations to identify and remove
any undesired concepts. In the Retraining step, we introduce CBDebug, a novel
method that leverages the interpretability of CBMs as a bridge for converting
concept-level user feedback into sample-level auxiliary labels. These labels
are then used to apply supervised bias mitigation and targeted augmentation,
reducing the model's reliance on undesired concepts. We evaluate our framework
with both real and automated expert feedback, and find that CBDebug
significantly outperforms prior retraining methods across multiple CBM
architectures (PIP-Net, Post-hoc CBM) and benchmarks with known spurious
correlations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 沉船是海洋历史的重要标记，但通过人工检查测深数据来发现沉船耗时且需要专家分析，因此需要自动化工具。

Method: 开发了一个深度学习模型，使用来自大湖区和爱尔兰海岸的沉船数据进行训练，并采用合成数据生成来增加数据集规模和多样性。工具可自动预处理测深数据、执行深度学习推理、阈值化模型输出，并生成像素级分割掩码或边界框。

Conclusion: ShipwreckFinder提供了一个有效的自动化沉船检测解决方案，显著提高了检测效率，并作为开源工具可供使用。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ShipwreckFinder, an open-source QGIS plugin that
detects shipwrecks from multibeam sonar data. Shipwrecks are an important
historical marker of maritime history, and can be discovered through manual
inspection of bathymetric data. However, this is a time-consuming process and
often requires expert analysis. Our proposed tool allows users to automatically
preprocess bathymetry data, perform deep learning inference, threshold model
outputs, and produce either pixel-wise segmentation masks or bounding boxes of
predicted shipwrecks. The backbone of this open-source tool is a deep learning
model, which is trained on a variety of shipwreck data from the Great Lakes and
the coasts of Ireland. Additionally, we employ synthetic data generation in
order to increase the size and diversity of our dataset. We demonstrate
superior segmentation performance with our open-source tool and training
pipeline as compared to a deep learning-based ArcGIS toolkit and a more
classical inverse sinkhole detection method. The open-source tool can be found

TL;DR: 研究探讨了基于幅度的剪枝对神经网络可解释性的影响，发现轻度到中度剪枝能改善显著性图的聚焦性和忠实度，而过度剪枝会降低可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明神经网络可以大幅剪枝而保持性能，但剪枝对模型可解释性的影响尚不清楚。

Method: 使用在ImageNette上训练的ResNet-18，比较不同剪枝水平下Vanilla Gradients和Integrated Gradients的事后解释，评估稀疏性和忠实度，并应用基于CRAFT的概念提取来跟踪学习概念的语义连贯性变化。

Result: 轻度到中度剪枝改善了显著性图的聚焦性和忠实度，同时保留了清晰、语义有意义的概念；而过度剪枝会合并异质特征，降低显著性图稀疏性和概念连贯性，尽管仍保持准确性。

Conclusion: 剪枝可以塑造内部表示使其更符合人类注意力模式，但过度剪枝会削弱可解释性。

Abstract: Prior works have shown that neural networks can be heavily pruned while
preserving performance, but the impact of pruning on model interpretability
remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how magnitude-based pruning
followed by fine-tuning affects both low-level saliency maps and high-level
concept representations. Using a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, we compare
post-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradients (IG)
across pruning levels, evaluating sparsity and faithfulness. We further apply
CRAFT-based concept extraction to track changes in semantic coherence of
learned concepts. Our results show that light-to-moderate pruning improves
saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, semantically
meaningful concepts. In contrast, aggressive pruning merges heterogeneous
features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite
maintaining accuracy. These findings suggest that while pruning can shape
internal representations toward more human-aligned attention patterns,
excessive pruning undermines interpretability.

Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖点云输入的局限性，因为大多数消费级相机缺乏深度传感器，而视觉数据更为普遍。

Method: 基于轻量级稀疏卷积骨干网络，使用两个专用头：一个用于3D物体检测，一个用于布局估计，采用新颖有效的参数化墙壁表示。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的场景理解基准测试中达到最先进性能：(i)使用真实点云，(ii)使用有姿态图像，(iii)使用无姿态图像。在布局估计方面显著提升，建立了整体室内场景理解的新基准。

Conclusion: TUN3D在无需真实相机位姿或深度监督的情况下，实现了联合布局估计和3D物体检测，为室内场景理解提供了紧凑而语义丰富的空间表示。

Abstract: Layout estimation and 3D object detection are two fundamental tasks in indoor
scene understanding. When combined, they enable the creation of a compact yet
semantically rich spatial representation of a scene. Existing approaches
typically rely on point cloud input, which poses a major limitation since most
consumer cameras lack depth sensors and visual-only data remains far more
common. We address this issue with TUN3D, the first method that tackles joint
layout estimation and 3D object detection in real scans, given multi-view
images as input, and does not require ground-truth camera poses or depth
supervision. Our approach builds on a lightweight sparse-convolutional backbone
and employs two dedicated heads: one for 3D object detection and one for layout
estimation, leveraging a novel and effective parametric wall representation.
Extensive experiments show that TUN3D achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three challenging scene understanding benchmarks: (i) using ground-truth
point clouds, (ii) using posed images, and (iii) using unposed images. While
performing on par with specialized 3D object detection methods, TUN3D
significantly advances layout estimation, setting a new benchmark in holistic
indoor scene understanding. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法往往忽视图像不同区域的重要性差异，可能损害视觉关键内容的重建质量，需要解决语义粒度不足的问题。

Method: 将图像分割为关键和非关键区域，关键区域使用图像导向语义编码器，非关键区域采用图像到文本建模压缩，结合模型量化和低秩自适应微调等轻量化技术。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提系统在语义保真度和视觉质量方面均优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该系统在图像传输任务中表现出有效性，能够在不牺牲性能的情况下显著提升资源利用率。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has
introduced significant opportunities for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy
of image transmission within semantic communication systems. Despite these
advancements, existing methodologies often neglect the difference in importance
of different regions of the image, potentially compromising the reconstruction
quality of visually critical content. To address this issue, we introduce an
innovative generative semantic communication system that refines semantic
granularity by segmenting images into key and non-key regions. Key regions,
which contain essential visual information, are processed using an image
oriented semantic encoder, while non-key regions are efficiently compressed
through an image-to-text modeling approach. Additionally, to mitigate the
substantial storage and computational demands posed by large AI models, the
proposed system employs a lightweight deployment strategy incorporating model
quantization and low-rank adaptation fine-tuning techniques, significantly
boosting resource utilization without sacrificing performance. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms traditional methods in
terms of both semantic fidelity and visual quality, thereby affirming its
effectiveness for image transmission tasks.

Conclusion: 骨架化尺度空间为形状分析提供了理论严谨的层次简化框架，超越了传统剪枝方法，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: The Hamilton-Jacobi skeleton, also known as the medial axis, is a powerful
shape descriptor that represents binary objects in terms of the centres of
maximal inscribed discs. Despite its broad applicability, the medial axis
suffers from sensitivity to noise: minor boundary variations can lead to
disproportionately large and undesirable expansions of the skeleton. Classical
pruning methods mitigate this shortcoming by systematically removing extraneous
skeletal branches. This sequential simplification of skeletons resembles the
principle of sparsification scale-spaces that embed images into a family of
reconstructions from increasingly sparse pixel representations.
  We combine both worlds by introducing skeletonisation scale-spaces: They
leverage sparsification of the medial axis to achieve hierarchical
simplification of shapes. Unlike conventional pruning, our framework inherently
satisfies key scale-space properties such as hierarchical architecture,
controllable simplification, and equivariance to geometric transformations. We
provide a rigorous theoretical foundation in both continuous and discrete
formulations and extend the concept further with densification. This allows
inverse progression from coarse to fine scales and can even reach beyond the
original skeleton to produce overcomplete shape representations with relevancy
for practical applications.
  Through proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework for practical tasks including robust skeletonisation, shape
compression, and stiffness enhancement for additive manufacturing.

Motivation: 现有气候预测空间分辨率较低（12.5公里），限制了地方决策的可用性，需要高分辨率气候预测支持本地决策。

Method: 在观测网格数据集上训练单图像超分辨率模型，然后应用于低分辨率气候预测；提出基于气候指标的评估方法，使用气象站观测数据计算气候指数来评估降尺度结果。

Result: 在日平均温度上的实验表明，单图像超分辨率模型能够降尺度气候预测，且不会增加气候指标的误差。

Conclusion: 单图像超分辨率模型可以有效提升气候预测的空间分辨率，为地方决策提供更精细的气候信息。

Abstract: High-resolution climate projections are essential for local decision-making.
However, available climate projections have low spatial resolution (e.g. 12.5
km), which limits their usability. We address this limitation by leveraging
single-image super-resolution models to statistically downscale climate
projections to 1-km resolution. Since high-resolution climate projections are
unavailable for training, we train models on a high-resolution observational
gridded data set and apply them to low-resolution climate projections. We
propose a climate indicator-based assessment using observed climate indices
computed at weather station locations to evaluate the downscaled climate
projections without ground-truth high-resolution climate projections.
Experiments on daily mean temperature demonstrate that single-image
super-resolution models can downscale climate projections without increasing
the error of climate indicators compared to low-resolution climate projections.

Conclusion: 研究强调了基于图像越狱攻击的实际挑战以及为VLMs开发高效防御机制的必要性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have remarkable abilities in generating
multimodal reasoning tasks. However, potential misuse or safety alignment
concerns of VLMs have increased significantly due to different categories of
attack vectors. Among various attack vectors, recent studies have demonstrated
that image-based perturbations are particularly effective in generating harmful
outputs. In the literature, many existing techniques have been proposed to
jailbreak VLMs, leading to unstable performance and visible perturbations. In
this study, we propose Jailbreaking with Loss-guided Image Perturbation
(JaiLIP), a jailbreaking attack in the image space that minimizes a joint
objective combining the mean squared error (MSE) loss between clean and
adversarial image with the models harmful-output loss. We evaluate our proposed
method on VLMs using standard toxicity metrics from Perspective API and
Detoxify. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates highly
effective and imperceptible adversarial images, outperforming existing methods
in producing toxicity. Moreover, we have evaluated our method in the
transportation domain to demonstrate the attacks practicality beyond toxic text
generation in specific domain. Our findings emphasize the practical challenges
of image-based jailbreak attacks and the need for efficient defense mechanisms
for VLMs.

Abstract: Automated identification of plants and animals has improved considerably in
the last few years, in particular thanks to the recent advances in deep
learning. The next big question is how far such automated systems are from the
human expertise. Indeed, even the best experts are sometimes confused and/or
disagree between each others when validating visual or audio observations of
living organism. A picture actually contains only a partial information that is
usually not sufficient to determine the right species with certainty.
Quantifying this uncertainty and comparing it to the performance of automated
systems is of high interest for both computer scientists and expert
naturalists. The LifeCLEF 2018 ExpertCLEF challenge presented in this paper was
designed to allow this comparison between human experts and automated systems.
In total, 19 deep-learning systems implemented by 4 different research teams
were evaluated with regard to 9 expert botanists of the French flora. The main
outcome of this work is that the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning
models is now close to the most advanced human expertise. This paper presents
more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge, summarizes the
approaches and systems employed by the participating research groups, and
provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

Abstract: The generation of quadrilateral-dominant meshes is a cornerstone of
professional 3D content creation. However, existing generative models generate
quad meshes by first generating triangle meshes and then merging triangles into
quadrilaterals with some specific rules, which typically produces quad meshes
with poor topology. In this paper, we introduce QuadGPT, the first
autoregressive framework for generating quadrilateral meshes in an end-to-end
manner. QuadGPT formulates this as a sequence prediction paradigm,
distinguished by two key innovations: a unified tokenization method to handle
mixed topologies of triangles and quadrilaterals, and a specialized
Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning method tDPO for better generation quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuadGPT significantly surpasses previous
triangle-to-quad conversion pipelines in both geometric accuracy and
topological quality. Our work establishes a new benchmark for native quad-mesh
generation and showcases the power of combining large-scale autoregressive
models with topology-aware RL refinement for creating structured 3D assets.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) inadvertently reproduce copyrighted
styles and protected visual concepts, raising legal and ethical concerns.
Concept erasure has emerged as a safeguard, aiming to selectively suppress such
concepts through fine-tuning. However, existing methods do not scale to
practical settings where providers must erase multiple and possibly conflicting
concepts. The core bottleneck is their reliance on static erasure: a single
checkpoint is fine-tuned to remove all target concepts, regardless of the
actual erasure needs at inference. This rigid design mismatches real-world
usage, where requests vary per generation, leading to degraded erasure success
and reduced fidelity for non-target content. We propose DyME, an on-demand
erasure framework that trains lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and
dynamically composes only those needed at inference. This modular design
enables flexible multi-concept erasure, but naive composition causes
interference among adapters, especially when many or semantically related
concepts are suppressed. To overcome this, we introduce bi-level orthogonality
constraints at both the feature and parameter levels, disentangling
representation shifts and enforcing orthogonal adapter subspaces. We further
develop ErasureBench-H, a new hierarchical benchmark with
brand-series-character structure, enabling principled evaluation across
semantic granularities and erasure set sizes. Experiments on ErasureBench-H and
standard datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100, Imagenette) demonstrate that DyME
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher
multi-concept erasure fidelity with minimal collateral degradation.

*Abdul Waheed,Zhen Wu,Dareen Alharthi,Seungone Kim,Bhiksha Raj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoJudge是一个专门用于评估视频理解模型输出的多模态大语言模型，在多个基准测试中超越了更大的基线模型，证明了视频输入对于视频理解任务评估的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标如BLEU、ROUGE等无法捕捉人类判断的细微差别，而人工评估成本高昂。多模态大语言模型在视频理解评估方面的应用相对较少探索。

Method: 通过生成器和评估器的交互训练：生成器根据目标评分生成响应，不匹配评估器评分的响应被丢弃。训练了3B和7B规模的VideoJudge模型。

Result: 在四个元评估基准中的三个上，VideoJudge-7B超越了更大的基线模型如Qwen2.5-VL（32B和72B）。发现纯语言模型法官表现不如多模态模型，长链思维推理不能提升性能。

Conclusion: 视频输入对于视频理解任务的评估至关重要，VideoJudge展示了专门化多模态评估模型的有效性。

Abstract: Precisely evaluating video understanding models remains challenging: commonly
used metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore fail to capture the fineness of
human judgment, while obtaining such judgments through manual evaluation is
costly. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) or
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as evaluators, but their extension to video
understanding remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce
VideoJudge, a 3B and 7B-sized MLLM judge specialized to evaluate outputs from
video understanding models (\textit{i.e.}, text responses conditioned on
videos). To train VideoJudge, our recipe builds on the interplay between a
generator and an evaluator: the generator is prompted to produce responses
conditioned on a target rating, and responses not matching the evaluator's
rating are discarded. Across three out of four meta-evaluation benchmarks,
VideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM judge baselines such as Qwen2.5-VL (32B
and 72B). Notably, we find that LLM judges (Qwen3) models perform worse than
MLLM judges (Qwen2.5-VL) and long chain-of-thought reasoning does not improve
performance, indicating that providing video inputs is crucial for evaluation
of video understanding tasks.

*Dereje Shenkut,B. V. K Vijaya Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReVQom是一种用于多智能体协同感知的端到端特征压缩方法，通过瓶颈网络和多阶段残差向量量化将特征从8192 bpp压缩到6-30 bpp，在DAIR-V2X数据集上实现273-1365倍压缩，在18 bpp时性能与原始特征相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体协同感知通过共享信息提升场景理解能力，但通信带宽限制了系统的可扩展性，需要高效的压缩方法来减少传输负载。

Method: 使用端到端方法，通过简单瓶颈网络压缩特征维度，然后采用多阶段残差向量量化(RVQ)，仅传输每个像素的码本索引。

Result: 在DAIR-V2X真实世界数据集上，ReVQom实现273倍(30 bpp)到1365倍(6 bpp)压缩，在18 bpp时性能匹配或超过原始特征协同感知，在6-12 bpp时支持超低带宽操作。

Conclusion: ReVQom能够实现高效准确的多智能体协同感知，为实际V2X部署迈出重要一步。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative perception (CP) improves scene understanding by
sharing information across connected agents such as autonomous vehicles,
unmanned aerial vehicles, and robots. Communication bandwidth, however,
constrains scalability. We present ReVQom, a learned feature codec that
preserves spatial identity while compressing intermediate features. ReVQom is
an end-to-end method that compresses feature dimensions via a simple bottleneck
network followed by multi-stage residual vector quantization (RVQ). This allows
only per-pixel code indices to be transmitted, reducing payloads from 8192 bits
per pixel (bpp) of uncompressed 32-bit float features to 6-30 bpp per agent
with minimal accuracy loss. On DAIR-V2X real-world CP dataset, ReVQom achieves
273x compression at 30 bpp to 1365x compression at 6 bpp. At 18 bpp (455x),
ReVQom matches or outperforms raw-feature CP, and at 6-12 bpp it enables
ultra-low-bandwidth operation with graceful degradation. ReVQom allows
efficient and accurate multi-agent collaborative perception with a step toward
practical V2X deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现当前文本到图像AI模型在生成沙特阿拉伯专业人士图像时存在严重的性别刻板印象和文化不准确性，其中DALL-E V3的性别偏见最严重（96%为男性）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查当代文本到图像AI模型在生成沙特专业人士图像时是否延续性别刻板印象和文化不准确性。

Method: 分析三个AI模型（ImageFX、DALL-E V3、Grok）生成的1,006张图像，使用中性提示词，由两名沙特注释员从五个维度评估，第三名资深研究员仲裁分歧。

Result: 所有模型都显示强烈性别不平衡：ImageFX 85%男性、Grok 86.6%男性、DALL-E V3 96%男性，领导和技术角色中性别偏见最明显，且普遍存在文化不准确性。

Conclusion: 当前模型反映了训练数据中的社会偏见，对沙特劳动力市场的性别动态和文化细微差别呈现有限。需要更多样化的训练数据、更公平的算法和文化敏感的评估框架。

Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which contemporary Text-to-Image
artificial intelligence (AI) models perpetuate gender stereotypes and cultural
inaccuracies when generating depictions of professionals in Saudi Arabia. We
analyzed 1,006 images produced by ImageFX, DALL-E V3, and Grok for 56 diverse
Saudi professions using neutral prompts. Two trained Saudi annotators evaluated
each image on five dimensions: perceived gender, clothing and appearance,
background and setting, activities and interactions, and age. A third senior
researcher adjudicated whenever the two primary raters disagreed, yielding
10,100 individual judgements. The results reveal a strong gender imbalance,
with ImageFX outputs being 85\% male, Grok 86.6\% male, and DALL-E V3 96\%
male, indicating that DALL-E V3 exhibited the strongest overall gender
stereotyping. This imbalance was most evident in leadership and technical
roles. Moreover, cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and depicted
activities were frequently observed across all three models.
Counter-stereotypical images often arise from cultural misinterpretations
rather than genuinely progressive portrayals. We conclude that current models
mirror societal biases embedded in their training data, generated by humans,
offering only a limited reflection of the Saudi labour market's gender dynamics
and cultural nuances. These findings underscore the urgent need for more
diverse training data, fairer algorithms, and culturally sensitive evaluation
frameworks to ensure equitable and authentic visual outputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于推理增强多模态大语言模型的预训练范式，用于统一的不当内容检测，通过三个针对性预训练任务解决短视频内容分布差异和复杂问题定义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要为每种不当内容类型训练单独的小型分类模型，需要大量人工标注数据且缺乏跨问题泛化能力。

Method: 引入三个预训练任务：Caption（增强视频细节感知）、VQA（加深问题定义理解）、Chain-of-Thought（增强推理能力）。

Result: 实验结果表明该预训练方法显著提升了MLLM在零样本和监督微调设置下的性能，并对未见问题表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该推理增强的MLLM预训练范式有效解决了短视频不当内容检测的分布差异和复杂定义问题，具有优秀的泛化性能。

Abstract: Short video platforms are evolving rapidly, making the identification of
inappropriate content increasingly critical. Existing approaches typically
train separate and small classification models for each type of issue, which
requires extensive human-labeled data and lacks cross-issue generalization. We
propose a reasoning-enhanced multimodal large language model (MLLM) pretraining
paradigm for unified inappropriate content detection. To address the
distribution gap between short video content and the original pretraining data
of MLLMs, as well as the complex issue definitions, we introduce three targeted
pretraining tasks: (1) \textit{Caption}, to enhance the MLLM's perception of
video details; (2) \textit{Visual Question Answering (VQA)}, to deepen the
MLLM's understanding of issue definitions and annotation guidelines; (3)
\textit{Chain-of-Thought (CoT)}, to enhance the MLLM's reasoning capability.
Experimental results show that our pretraining approach significantly improves
the MLLM's performance in both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
settings. In addition, our pretrained model demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities to emergent, previously unseen issues.

TL;DR: 将GUI定位重新定义为交互式搜索任务，使用光标移动而非直接坐标预测，通过强化学习训练GUI-Cursor模型，在ScreenSpot数据集上取得SOTA结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统坐标预测方法在处理高分辨率GUI图像时精度不足，需要更稳健的定位方法

Method: 将GUI定位重构为交互式搜索任务，模型通过多步移动光标来定位UI元素，使用强化学习和轨迹奖励函数训练

Result: 在ScreenSpot-v2上从88.8%提升到93.9%，在ScreenSpot-Pro上从26.8%提升到56.5%，95%的实例在两步内解决

Conclusion: 交互式搜索方法比直接坐标预测更有效，能够自适应处理不同难度的GUI定位任务

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding is commonly framed as a coordinate
prediction task -- given a natural language instruction, generate on-screen
coordinates for actions such as clicks and keystrokes. However, recent Vision
Language Models (VLMs) often fail to predict accurate numeric coordinates when
processing high-resolution GUI images with complex layouts. To address this
issue, we reframe GUI grounding as an \emph{interactive search task}, where the
VLM generates actions to move a cursor in the GUI to locate UI elements. At
each step, the model determines the target object, evaluates the spatial
relations between the cursor and the target, and moves the cursor closer to the
target conditioned on the movement history. In this interactive process, the
rendered cursor provides visual feedback to help the model align its
predictions with the corresponding on-screen locations. We train our GUI
grounding model, GUI-Cursor, using multi-step online reinforcement learning
with a dense trajectory-based reward function. Our experimental results show
that GUI-Cursor, based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, improves the GUI grounding accuracy
and achieves state-of-the-art results on ScreenSpot-v2 ($88.8\% \rightarrow
93.9\%$) and ScreenSpot-Pro ($26.8\% \rightarrow 56.5\%$). Moreover, we observe
that GUI-Cursor learns to solve the problem within two steps for 95\% of
instances and can adaptively conduct more steps on more difficult examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本-视频检索系统存在两个问题：低质量文本-视频数据对会影响检索效果但难以识别；余弦相似度无法解释排序结果，限制了可解释性。

Method: 在现有基准上增加视频注释以减少数据偏差，设计检索链式思维推理，通过成对比较步骤生成详细推理和完整排序。

Result: X-CoT在实证中提高了检索性能并产生详细推理依据，同时便于模型行为和数据质量分析。

Conclusion: X-CoT框架通过可解释的检索方法解决了传统系统的局限性，提供了更好的检索性能和解释能力。

Abstract: Prevalent text-to-video retrieval systems mainly adopt embedding models for
feature extraction and compute cosine similarities for ranking. However, this
design presents two limitations. Low-quality text-video data pairs could
compromise the retrieval, yet are hard to identify and examine. Cosine
similarity alone provides no explanation for the ranking results, limiting the
interpretability. We ask that can we interpret the ranking results, so as to
assess the retrieval models and examine the text-video data? This work proposes
X-CoT, an explainable retrieval framework upon LLM CoT reasoning in place of
the embedding model-based similarity ranking. We first expand the existing
benchmarks with additional video annotations to support semantic understanding
and reduce data bias. We also devise a retrieval CoT consisting of pairwise
comparison steps, yielding detailed reasoning and complete ranking. X-CoT
empirically improves the retrieval performance and produces detailed
rationales. It also facilitates the model behavior and data quality analysis.

Motivation: 手术器械的安全性需要可靠的视觉缺陷检测，但手动检查容易出错，现有基于自然/工业图像的自动检测方法在手术领域效果不佳，存在误报、对小缺陷不敏感以及领域偏移问题。

Method: 整合背景掩码、基于补丁的分析策略和高效的领域自适应，专门针对手术器械调整无监督缺陷检测方法。

Result: 该方法克服了现有方法的局限性，能够在手术器械图像中可靠地检测细粒度缺陷。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过领域特定调整，实现了对手术器械缺陷的有效检测，解决了现有方法在手术领域的应用挑战。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of surgical instruments requires reliable detection of
visual defects. However, manual inspection is prone to error, and existing
automated defect detection methods, typically trained on natural/industrial
images, fail to transfer effectively to the surgical domain. We demonstrate
that simply applying or fine-tuning these approaches leads to issues: false
positive detections arising from textured backgrounds, poor sensitivity to
small, subtle defects, and inadequate capture of instrument-specific features
due to domain shift. To address these challenges, we propose a versatile method
that adapts unsupervised defect detection methods specifically for surgical
instruments. By integrating background masking, a patch-based analysis
strategy, and efficient domain adaptation, our method overcomes these
limitations, enabling the reliable detection of fine-grained defects in
surgical instrument imagery.

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于表示对齐的方法依赖计算昂贵的大型预训练编码器，需要寻找更高效的训练策略来改进扩散模型的判别特征表示。

Method: 提出LSEP正则化，直接促进网络中间层表示的线性可分性，将线性探测融入学习动态而非仅作为后评估工具，无需辅助编码器。

Result: 在基于流的Transformer架构（如SiT）上，显著提高了训练效率和生成质量，在256×256 ImageNet数据集上达到1.46 FID。

Conclusion: LSEP方法有效替代了表示对齐，无需外部编码器，直接优化线性可分性，在扩散模型训练中实现了更好的效率和性能。

Abstract: Efficient training strategies for large-scale diffusion models have recently
emphasized the importance of improving discriminative feature representations
in these models. A central line of work in this direction is representation
alignment with features obtained from powerful external encoders, which
improves the representation quality as assessed through linear probing.
Alignment-based approaches show promise but depend on large pretrained
encoders, which are computationally expensive to obtain. In this work, we
propose an alternative regularization for training, based on promoting the
Linear SEParability (LSEP) of intermediate layer representations. LSEP
eliminates the need for an auxiliary encoder and representation alignment,
while incorporating linear probing directly into the network's learning
dynamics rather than treating it as a simple post-hoc evaluation tool. Our
results demonstrate substantial improvements in both training efficiency and
generation quality on flow-based transformer architectures such as SiTs,
achieving an FID of 1.46 on $256 \times 256$ ImageNet dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了一种空间正则化的对比学习策略，通过整合半变异函数来建模空间相关性，解决图像地理定位中假阴性和难负样本的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习方法忽略了地理空间中的空间依赖性，导致无法有效处理假阴性（视觉和地理相似但被标记为负样本的图像对）和难负样本（视觉相似但地理距离远的图像对）。

Method: 使用半变异函数将特征空间中的图像距离与地理距离关联，捕捉空间相关性。通过拟合的半变异函数定义给定空间距离下的预期视觉差异，用于识别难负样本和假阴性。

Result: 在OSV5M数据集上评估，显示显式建模空间先验能提高图像地理定位性能，特别是在更细粒度上表现更好。

Conclusion: 整合空间先验的对比学习策略能有效提升图像地理定位的准确性和鲁棒性，特别是在处理空间相关性和视觉相似性方面。

Abstract: Accurate and robust image-based geo-localization at a global scale is
challenging due to diverse environments, visually ambiguous scenes, and the
lack of distinctive landmarks in many regions. While contrastive learning
methods show promising performance by aligning features between street-view
images and corresponding locations, they neglect the underlying spatial
dependency in the geographic space. As a result, they fail to address the issue
of false negatives -- image pairs that are both visually and geographically
similar but labeled as negatives, and struggle to effectively distinguish hard
negatives, which are visually similar but geographically distant. To address
this issue, we propose a novel spatially regularized contrastive learning
strategy that integrates a semivariogram, which is a geostatistical tool for
modeling how spatial correlation changes with distance. We fit the
semivariogram by relating the distance of images in feature space to their
geographical distance, capturing the expected visual content in a spatial
correlation. With the fitted semivariogram, we define the expected visual
dissimilarity at a given spatial distance as reference to identify hard
negatives and false negatives. We integrate this strategy into GeoCLIP and
evaluate it on the OSV5M dataset, demonstrating that explicitly modeling
spatial priors improves image-based geo-localization performance, particularly
at finer granularity.

Abstract: We introduce X-Streamer, an end-to-end multimodal human world modeling
framework for building digital human agents capable of infinite interactions
across text, speech, and video within a single unified architecture. Starting
from a single portrait, X-Streamer enables real-time, open-ended video calls
driven by streaming multimodal inputs. At its core is a Thinker-Actor
dual-transformer architecture that unifies multimodal understanding and
generation, turning a static portrait into persistent and intelligent
audiovisual interactions. The Thinker module perceives and reasons over
streaming user inputs, while its hidden states are translated by the Actor into
synchronized multimodal streams in real time. Concretely, the Thinker leverages
a pretrained large language-speech model, while the Actor employs a chunk-wise
autoregressive diffusion model that cross-attends to the Thinker's hidden
states to produce time-aligned multimodal responses with interleaved discrete
text and audio tokens and continuous video latents. To ensure long-horizon
stability, we design inter- and intra-chunk attentions with time-aligned
multimodal positional embeddings for fine-grained cross-modality alignment and
context retention, further reinforced by chunk-wise diffusion forcing and
global identity referencing. X-Streamer runs in real time on two A100 GPUs,
sustaining hours-long consistent video chat experiences from arbitrary
portraits and paving the way toward unified world modeling of interactive
digital humans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成器虽然被视为世界模型，但在从单张图像预测运动方面表现不佳，特别是在简单物理场景中。这主要是因为生成像素的开销过大，而不是直接建模运动。

Method: 将任务构建为条件生成密集轨迹网格，采用现代视频生成器的架构但输出运动轨迹而非像素，从而直接捕捉场景范围内的动态和不确定性。

Result: 该方法在模拟数据上表现优异，在机器人等下游应用中有效，在真实世界直观物理数据集上显示出有前景的准确性，比先前的回归器和生成器产生更准确和多样化的预测。

Conclusion: 直接建模运动轨迹比生成像素更有效地解决了从单张图像预测运动的问题，为运动预测提供了更准确和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of forecasting motion from a single image, i.e.,
predicting how objects in the world are likely to move, without the ability to
observe other parameters such as the object velocities or the forces applied to
them. We formulate this task as conditional generation of dense trajectory
grids with a model that closely follows the architecture of modern video
generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels. This approach
captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and
diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively
evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on
downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on
real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video
generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with
forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such
as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on
such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating
pixels rather than directly modeling motion.

Motivation: 理解不同自监督学习架构在视频动作识别中的性能差异，为选择合适的特征提取方法提供实证指导。

Method: 在UCF Sports数据集上评估两种架构，通过分类精度、聚类性能、类内一致性和类间区分度等多个维度分析特征质量。

Result: DINOv3在聚类性能（轮廓分数0.31 vs 0.21）和姿态识别动作的区分能力（6.16倍分离比）上更优，而V-JEPA2在所有动作类型上表现更一致可靠（性能方差0.094 vs 0.288）。

Conclusion: DINOv3的空间处理架构擅长静态姿态识别但在运动依赖动作上表现下降，V-JEPA2的时间建模在不同动作类别间提供更平衡的表示质量，选择应基于任务需求和可靠性约束。

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of two prominent
self-supervised learning architectures for video action recognition: DINOv3,
which processes frames independently through spatial feature extraction, and
V-JEPA2, which employs joint temporal modeling across video sequences. We
evaluate both approaches on the UCF Sports dataset, examining feature quality
through multiple dimensions including classification accuracy, clustering
performance, intra-class consistency, and inter-class discrimination. Our
analysis reveals fundamental architectural trade-offs: DINOv3 achieves superior
clustering performance (Silhouette score: 0.31 vs 0.21) and demonstrates
exceptional discrimination capability (6.16x separation ratio) particularly for
pose-identifiable actions, while V-JEPA2 exhibits consistent reliability across
all action types with significantly lower performance variance (0.094 vs
0.288). Through action-specific evaluation, we identify that DINOv3's spatial
processing architecture excels at static pose recognition but shows degraded
performance on motion-dependent actions, whereas V-JEPA2's temporal modeling
provides balanced representation quality across diverse action categories.
These findings contribute to the understanding of architectural design choices
in video analysis systems and provide empirical guidance for selecting
appropriate feature extraction methods based on task requirements and
reliability constraints.

Motivation: 传统灾害评估方法缓慢危险，现有计算机视觉方法只能提供分类标签或分割掩码，缺乏对灾害场景的全面理解能力。

Method: 采用双架构方法：CNN-LSTM模型用于卫星图像，ViT模型用于无人机图像，结合ConceptNet和WordNet的外部语义知识扩展词汇覆盖。

Result: VLCE在InfoMetIC指标上达到95.33%，显著优于LLaVA和QwenVL等基线模型，同时保持有竞争力的语义对齐。

Conclusion: 双架构系统在自动化生成可操作、信息密集的灾害描述方面具有显著潜力，能够改进灾害损害评估。

Abstract: Immediate damage assessment is essential after natural catastrophes; yet,
conventional hand evaluation techniques are sluggish and perilous. Although
satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photos offer extensive perspectives
of impacted regions, current computer vision methodologies generally yield just
classification labels or segmentation masks, so constraining their capacity to
deliver a thorough situational comprehension. We introduce the Vision Language
Caption Enhancer (VLCE), a multimodal system designed to produce comprehensive,
contextually-informed explanations of disaster imagery. VLCE employs a
dual-architecture approach: a CNN-LSTM model with a ResNet50 backbone
pretrained on EuroSat satellite imagery for the xBD dataset, and a Vision
Transformer (ViT) model pretrained on UAV pictures for the RescueNet dataset.
Both systems utilize external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to
expand vocabulary coverage and improve description accuracy. We assess VLCE in
comparison to leading vision-language models (LLaVA and QwenVL) utilizing
CLIPScore for semantic alignment and InfoMetIC for caption informativeness.
Experimental findings indicate that VLCE markedly surpasses baseline models,
attaining a maximum of 95.33% on InfoMetIC while preserving competitive
semantic alignment. Our dual-architecture system demonstrates significant
potential for improving disaster damage assessment by automating the production

### [42] [A Data-driven Typology of Vision Models from Integrated Representational Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21628)
*Jialin Wu,Shreya Saha,Yiqing Bo,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于表示相似性度量的框架来分析不同视觉模型家族的表示特征，发现几何结构和单元调谐具有家族特异性，而线性可解码信息则更广泛共享。通过相似性网络融合方法，实现了比单个度量更强的家族分离效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同视觉模型在架构和训练范式上差异很大，但缺乏系统方法来识别哪些表示特征是跨家族共享的，哪些反映了独特的计算策略。

Method: 使用多种表示相似性度量（RSA、Soft Matching、Linear Predictivity等）评估模型表示，并采用相似性网络融合（SNF）方法整合不同度量的互补信息。

Result: 几何和调谐相关的度量能有效区分模型家族，而线性可解码信息显示较弱分离。SNF融合后实现了显著的家族分离，聚类分析揭示了监督ResNets和ViTs形成不同簇，自监督模型跨架构聚集，混合架构与掩码自编码器聚类。

Conclusion: 该生物学启发的框架为视觉模型提供了原则性分类学，表明新兴计算策略（由架构和训练目标共同塑造）定义了超越表面设计类别的表示结构。

Abstract: Large vision models differ widely in architecture and training paradigm, yet
we lack principled methods to determine which aspects of their representations
are shared across families and which reflect distinctive computational
strategies. We leverage a suite of representational similarity metrics, each
capturing a different facet-geometry, unit tuning, or linear decodability-and
assess family separability using multiple complementary measures. Metrics
preserving geometry or tuning (e.g., RSA, Soft Matching) yield strong family
discrimination, whereas flexible mappings such as Linear Predictivity show
weaker separation. These findings indicate that geometry and tuning carry
family-specific signatures, while linearly decodable information is more
broadly shared. To integrate these complementary facets, we adapt Similarity
Network Fusion (SNF), a method inspired by multi-omics integration. SNF
achieves substantially sharper family separation than any individual metric and
produces robust composite signatures. Clustering of the fused similarity matrix
recovers both expected and surprising patterns: supervised ResNets and ViTs
form distinct clusters, yet all self-supervised models group together across
architectural boundaries. Hybrid architectures (ConvNeXt, Swin) cluster with
masked autoencoders, suggesting convergence between architectural modernization
and reconstruction-based training. This biology-inspired framework provides a
principled typology of vision models, showing that emergent computational
strategies-shaped jointly by architecture and training objective-define
representational structure beyond surface design categories.

*Yixiang Dai,Fan Jiang,Chiyu Wang,Mu Xu,Yonggang Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FantasyWorld是一个几何增强框架，通过向冻结的视频基础模型添加可训练的几何分支，在单次前向传播中联合建模视频潜在表示和隐式3D场，实现3D感知的视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频基础模型缺乏明确的3D基础能力，限制了空间一致性和下游3D推理任务的实用性。需要将视频想象力与3D感知能力相结合。

Method: 引入跨分支监督机制，几何线索指导视频生成，视频先验正则化3D预测，从而产生一致且可泛化的3D感知视频表示。

Result: 实验表明FantasyWorld有效桥接了视频想象力与3D感知，在多视角一致性和风格一致性方面优于最近的几何一致性基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过统一骨干网络和跨分支信息交换，FantasyWorld成功实现了3D感知的视频生成，其几何分支产生的潜在表示可作为下游3D任务的通用表示。

Abstract: High-quality 3D world models are pivotal for embodied intelligence and
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), underpinning applications such as AR/VR
content creation and robotic navigation. Despite the established strong
imaginative priors, current video foundation models lack explicit 3D grounding
capabilities, thus being limited in both spatial consistency and their utility
for downstream 3D reasoning tasks. In this work, we present FantasyWorld, a
geometry-enhanced framework that augments frozen video foundation models with a
trainable geometric branch, enabling joint modeling of video latents and an
implicit 3D field in a single forward pass. Our approach introduces
cross-branch supervision, where geometry cues guide video generation and video
priors regularize 3D prediction, thus yielding consistent and generalizable
3D-aware video representations. Notably, the resulting latents from the
geometric branch can potentially serve as versatile representations for
downstream 3D tasks such as novel view synthesis and navigation, without
requiring per-scene optimization or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show
that FantasyWorld effectively bridges video imagination and 3D perception,
outperforming recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and
style consistency. Ablation studies further confirm that these gains stem from
the unified backbone and cross-branch information exchange.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MORPH是一个形状无关的自回归基础模型，用于处理偏微分方程。它能处理不同维度、分辨率和物理场的异构时空数据，通过组件卷积、跨场注意力等机制实现高效学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PDE模型难以处理异构的时空数据集，包括不同维度、分辨率、物理场类型的数据。需要一种灵活的基础模型来统一处理这种多样性。

Method: 基于卷积视觉Transformer架构，结合组件卷积处理标量和矢量通道，跨场注意力建模不同物理场间信息，轴向注意力降低计算负担。使用预训练和微调策略。

Result: 在多个下游预测任务中，MORPH在零样本和全样本泛化方面都优于从头训练的模型，匹配或超越了现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: MORPH为科学机器学习提供了一个灵活强大的骨干网络，能够有效处理科学观测数据的异构性和多模态特性。

Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a shape-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for
partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision
transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal
datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions,
multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture
combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and
vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field
cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between
different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full
spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to
reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple
model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and
evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both
full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH
outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot
generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong
baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities
present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and
multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable
and data-efficient scientific machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决红外成像在低光和恶劣天气条件下目标检测面临的类别不平衡、热噪声和计算限制等挑战

Method: 在YOLOv8基础上，用MobileNetV4替换CSPDarknet骨干网络降低计算量，并引入SlideLoss损失函数动态关注欠代表和被遮挡样本

Result: 在FLIR ADAS V2数据集上，MS-YOLO仅需6.7 GFLOPs计算量，达到竞争性mAP和更优的精度，计算开销减少1.5%

Conclusion: MS-YOLO有效解决了保持高检测质量同时最小化计算成本的双重挑战，适合城市环境中的实时边缘部署

Abstract: Infrared imaging has emerged as a robust solution for urban object detection
under low-light and adverse weather conditions, offering significant advantages
over traditional visible-light cameras. However, challenges such as class
imbalance, thermal noise, and computational constraints can significantly
hinder model performance in practical settings. To address these issues, we
evaluate multiple YOLO variants on the FLIR ADAS V2 dataset, ultimately
selecting YOLOv8 as our baseline due to its balanced accuracy and efficiency.
Building on this foundation, we present \texttt{MS-YOLO} (\textbf{M}obileNetv4
and \textbf{S}lideLoss based on YOLO), which replaces YOLOv8's CSPDarknet
backbone with the more efficient MobileNetV4, reducing computational overhead
by \textbf{1.5%} while sustaining high accuracy. In addition, we introduce
\emph{SlideLoss}, a novel loss function that dynamically emphasizes
under-represented and occluded samples, boosting precision without sacrificing
recall. Experiments on the FLIR ADAS V2 benchmark show that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
attains competitive mAP and superior precision while operating at only
\textbf{6.7 GFLOPs}. These results demonstrate that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
effectively addresses the dual challenge of maintaining high detection quality
while minimizing computational costs, making it well-suited for real-time edge
deployment in urban environments.

*Xu Yang,Gady Agam*

TL;DR: 提出Motion-Aware Transformer (MATR)，通过显式预测跨帧物体运动来提前更新跟踪查询，减少查询冲突，在多目标跟踪任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DETR-based多目标跟踪框架将检测和跟踪查询在单个Transformer解码器层中联合处理，导致查询冲突和关联精度下降。

Method: 引入运动感知Transformer (MATR)，显式预测物体在帧间的运动，提前更新跟踪查询，减少查询碰撞，实现更一致的训练。

Result: 在DanceTrack上HOTA提升超过9分，达到71.3的SOTA；在SportsMOT上72.2 HOTA，BDD100k上54.7 mTETA和41.6 mHOTA，均达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: 在端到端Transformer中显式建模运动是推进多目标跟踪的简单而高效的方法。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in videos remains challenging due to complex
object motions and crowded scenes. Recent DETR-based frameworks offer
end-to-end solutions but typically process detection and tracking queries
jointly within a single Transformer Decoder layer, leading to conflicts and
degraded association accuracy. We introduce the Motion-Aware Transformer
(MATR), which explicitly predicts object movements across frames to update
track queries in advance. By reducing query collisions, MATR enables more
consistent training and improves both detection and association. Extensive
experiments on DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BDD100k show that MATR delivers
significant gains across standard metrics. On DanceTrack, MATR improves HOTA by
more than 9 points over MOTR without additional data and reaches a new
state-of-the-art score of 71.3 with supplementary data. MATR also achieves
state-of-the-art results on SportsMOT (72.2 HOTA) and BDD100k (54.7 mTETA, 41.6
mHOTA) without relying on external datasets. These results demonstrate that
explicitly modeling motion within end-to-end Transformers offers a simple yet
highly effective approach to advancing multi-object tracking.

TL;DR: DeLiVR是一种高效的视频去雨方法，通过将时空李群微分偏置直接注入网络注意力分数中，实现几何一致的视频去雨。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决野外拍摄视频中的雨纹、模糊和噪声问题，以及相机姿态微小变化导致的跨帧不匹配和时间伪影。现有方法依赖光流或启发式对齐，计算成本高且鲁棒性差。

Method: 提出两个互补组件：旋转有界的李相对偏置预测帧内平面角度实现几何一致对齐；微分群位移计算相邻帧角度差估计速度，结合时间衰减和注意力掩码聚焦帧间关系。

Result: 在公开基准测试上的广泛实验结果表明该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 李群为视频建模中的空间和时间一致性提供了原则性表示方法，DeLiVR通过注入李群微分偏置实现了高效且鲁棒的视频去雨。

Abstract: Videos captured in the wild often suffer from rain streaks, blur, and noise.
In addition, even slight changes in camera pose can amplify cross-frame
mismatches and temporal artifacts. Existing methods rely on optical flow or
heuristic alignment, which are computationally expensive and less robust. To
address these challenges, Lie groups provide a principled way to represent
continuous geometric transformations, making them well-suited for enforcing
spatial and temporal consistency in video modeling. Building on this insight,
we propose DeLiVR, an efficient video deraining method that injects
spatiotemporal Lie-group differential biases directly into attention scores of
the network. Specifically, the method introduces two complementary components.
First, a rotation-bounded Lie relative bias predicts the in-plane angle of each
frame using a compact prediction module, where normalized coordinates are
rotated and compared with base coordinates to achieve geometry-consistent
alignment before feature aggregation. Second, a differential group displacement
computes angular differences between adjacent frames to estimate a velocity.
This bias computation combines temporal decay and attention masks to focus on
inter-frame relationships while precisely matching the direction of rain
streaks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on publicly available benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受到自然图像领域基础模型巨大进展的启发，希望将这种技术应用于SAR领域。基础模型具有需要少量标注数据即可适应下游任务、对分布偏移更鲁棒、特征可迁移性强等优势。

Method: 首先测试现有最强视觉基础模型(DINOv2、DINOv3、PE-Core)在SAR目标识别中的表现，然后使用SAR数据对公开SSL模型进行自监督微调，开发了AFRL-DINOv2系列模型。

Result: AFRL-DINOv2模型显著超越了当前最佳SAR领域模型SARATR-X，建立了新的SAR基础模型最先进性能。实验分析了不同骨干网络和下游任务适应方法的性能权衡。

Conclusion: 自监督微调公开SSL模型是构建SAR基础模型的可行路径，尽管取得了积极成果，但在SAR基础模型建设方面仍有很长的路要走。

Abstract: In this work we investigate the viability of foundational AI/ML models for
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object recognition tasks. We are inspired by the
tremendous progress being made in the wider community, particularly in the
natural image domain where frontier labs are training huge models on web-scale
datasets with unprecedented computing budgets. It has become clear that these
models, often trained with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), will transform how
we develop AI/ML solutions for object recognition tasks - they can be adapted
downstream with very limited labeled data, they are more robust to many forms
of distribution shift, and their features are highly transferable
out-of-the-box. For these reasons and more, we are motivated to apply this
technology to the SAR domain. In our experiments we first run tests with
today's most powerful visual foundational models, including DINOv2, DINOv3 and
PE-Core and observe their shortcomings at extracting semantically-interesting
discriminative SAR target features when used off-the-shelf. We then show that
Self-Supervised finetuning of publicly available SSL models with SAR data is a
viable path forward by training several AFRL-DINOv2s and setting a new
state-of-the-art for SAR foundation models, significantly outperforming today's
best SAR-domain model SARATR-X. Our experiments further analyze the performance
trade-off of using different backbones with different downstream
task-adaptation recipes, and we monitor each model's ability to overcome
challenges within the downstream environments (e.g., extended operating
conditions and low amounts of labeled data). We hope this work will inform and
inspire future SAR foundation model builders, because despite our positive
results, we still have a long way to go.

TL;DR: UISim是一个基于图像的UI模拟器，通过两阶段方法从屏幕图像预测和合成UI状态转换，为移动界面测试和AI代理训练提供动态交互平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖物理设备或静态截图分析，难以应对真实移动环境的动态多样性，限制了可扩展测试和智能UI代理的开发。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：给定初始屏幕图像和用户操作，首先预测下一UI状态的抽象布局，然后基于预测布局合成视觉一致的新图像。

Result: 实验表明UISim在生成真实连贯的后续UI状态方面优于端到端UI生成基线方法。

Conclusion: UISim为UI测试、快速原型和合成数据生成提供实用价值，并为AI代理的UI导航任务规划等高级应用铺平道路。

Abstract: Developing and testing user interfaces (UIs) and training AI agents to
interact with them are challenging due to the dynamic and diverse nature of
real-world mobile environments. Existing methods often rely on cumbersome
physical devices or limited static analysis of screenshots, which hinders
scalable testing and the development of intelligent UI agents. We introduce
UISim, a novel image-based UI simulator that offers a dynamic and interactive
platform for exploring mobile phone environments purely from screen images. Our
system employs a two-stage method: given an initial phone screen image and a
user action, it first predicts the abstract layout of the next UI state, then
synthesizes a new, visually consistent image based on this predicted layout.
This approach enables the realistic simulation of UI transitions. UISim
provides immediate practical benefits for UI testing, rapid prototyping, and
synthetic data generation. Furthermore, its interactive capabilities pave the
way for advanced applications, such as UI navigation task planning for AI
agents. Our experimental results show that UISim outperforms end-to-end UI
generation baselines in generating realistic and coherent subsequent UI states,
highlighting its fidelity and potential to streamline UI development and
enhance AI agent training.

Abstract: Lightweight retinal vessel segmentation is important for the early diagnosis
of vision-threatening and systemic diseases, especially in a real-world
clinical environment with limited computational resources. Although
segmentation methods based on deep learning are improving, existing models are
still facing challenges of small vessel segmentation and high computational
costs. To address these challenges, we proposed a new vascular segmentation
network, LFA-Net, which incorporates a newly designed attention module,
LiteFusion-Attention. This attention module incorporates residual learning
connections, Vision Mamba-inspired dynamics, and modulation-based attention,
enabling the model to capture local and global context efficiently and in a
lightweight manner. LFA-Net offers high performance with 0.11 million
parameters, 0.42 MB memory size, and 4.46 GFLOPs, which make it ideal for
resource-constrained environments. We validated our proposed model on DRIVE,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法低估了视觉场景上下文信息在建模个体关系中的重要性，并且忽视了情感标签的语义信息对情感完整理解的关键作用。

Method: 提出包含视觉上下文编码模块和情感语义编码模块的框架，前者利用多尺度场景信息编码个体关系，后者利用大语言模型生成情感词典并通过情感树结构精炼语义表示，最后通过相似性感知交互整合视觉和语义信息。

Result: 在三个广泛采用的GER数据集上的实验表明，所提方法相比最先进方法取得了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 通过有效整合视觉场景上下文和标签引导的语义信息，能够显著提升群体级情感识别的性能。

Abstract: Group-level emotion recognition (GER) aims to identify holistic emotions
within a scene involving multiple individuals. Current existed methods
underestimate the importance of visual scene contextual information in modeling
individual relationships. Furthermore, they overlook the crucial role of
semantic information from emotional labels for complete understanding of
emotions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that
incorporates visual scene context and label-guided semantic information to
improve GER performance. It involves the visual context encoding module that
leverages multi-scale scene information to diversely encode individual
relationships. Complementarily, the emotion semantic encoding module utilizes
group-level emotion labels to prompt a large language model to generate nuanced
emotion lexicons. These lexicons, in conjunction with the emotion labels, are
then subsequently refined into comprehensive semantic representations through
the utilization of a structured emotion tree. Finally, similarity-aware
interaction is proposed to align and integrate visual and semantic information,
thereby generating enhanced group-level emotion representations and
subsequently improving the performance of GER. Experiments on three widely
adopted GER datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM模型直接应用于医学图像分割时面临三个主要挑战：模糊边界、缺乏解剖关系建模和不确定性量化缺失，这限制了其在临床环境中的可靠性。

Method: KG-SAM包含三个核心组件：(1)医学知识图谱编码细粒度解剖关系；(2)基于能量的条件随机场确保解剖一致性预测；(3)不确定性感知融合模块提升临床场景可靠性。

Result: 在多中心医学数据集上的实验表明，KG-SAM在前列腺分割中达到82.69%的平均Dice分数，在腹部分割中MRI达到78.05%，CT达到79.68%。

Conclusion: KG-SAM被确立为一个稳健且可推广的框架，能够显著推进医学图像分割的发展。

Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has achieved remarkable success in
image segmentation, its direct application to medical imaging remains hindered
by fundamental challenges, including ambiguous boundaries, insufficient
modeling of anatomical relationships, and the absence of uncertainty
quantification. To address these limitations, we introduce KG-SAM, a
knowledge-guided framework that synergistically integrates anatomical priors
with boundary refinement and uncertainty estimation. Specifically, KG-SAM
incorporates (i) a medical knowledge graph to encode fine-grained anatomical
relationships, (ii) an energy-based Conditional Random Field (CRF) to enforce
anatomically consistent predictions, and (iii) an uncertainty-aware fusion
module to enhance reliability in high-stakes clinical scenarios. Extensive
experiments across multi-center medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach: KG-SAM achieves an average Dice score of 82.69% on prostate
segmentation and delivers substantial gains in abdominal segmentation, reaching
78.05% on MRI and 79.68% on CT. These results establish KG-SAM as a robust and
generalizable framework for advancing medical image segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受大语言模型启发，现有视觉模型需要跨模态和跨源的任务特定预训练，成本高且难以扩展到未见任务。预训练视频生成模型已捕获时序依赖，探索其是否能适应多样图像和视频任务。

Method: 提出UniVid框架，微调视频扩散变换器，将任务表示为视觉句子，上下文序列定义任务和输出模态。支持跨模态推理（图像和视频组合）和跨源任务（自然到标注数据）。

Result: 仅使用自然视频数据训练，UniVid在跨模态和跨源设置中泛化良好。理解和生成任务可通过简单反转视觉句子顺序切换。

Conclusion: 预训练视频生成模型有潜力作为可扩展和统一的视觉建模基础。

Abstract: Large language models, trained on extensive corpora, successfully unify
diverse linguistic tasks within a single generative framework. Inspired by
this, recent works like Large Vision Model (LVM) extend this paradigm to vision
by organizing tasks into sequential visual sentences, where visual prompts
serve as the context to guide outputs. However, such modeling requires
task-specific pre-training across modalities and sources, which is costly and
limits scalability to unseen tasks. Given that pre-trained video generation
models inherently capture temporal sequence dependencies, we explore a more
unified and scalable alternative: can a pre-trained video generation model
adapt to diverse image and video tasks? To answer this, we propose UniVid, a
framework that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to handle various
vision tasks without task-specific modifications. Tasks are represented as
visual sentences, where the context sequence defines both the task and the
expected output modality. We evaluate the generalization of UniVid from two
perspectives: (1) cross-modal inference with contexts composed of both images
and videos, extending beyond LVM's uni-modal setting; (2) cross-source tasks
from natural to annotated data, without multi-source pre-training. Despite
being trained solely on natural video data, UniVid generalizes well in both
settings. Notably, understanding and generation tasks can easily switch by
simply reversing the visual sentence order in this paradigm. These findings
highlight the potential of pre-trained video generation models to serve as a
scalable and unified foundation for vision modeling. Our code will be released
at https://github.com/CUC-MIPG/UniVid.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种保持空间完整性的token合并方法，使现代ViT架构能够兼容token缩减技术，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代ViT架构采用空间设计（如窗口注意力、相对位置编码），但现有token缩减方法无法保持这些架构依赖的空间结构，导致兼容性问题。

Method: 使用2D缩减策略保持结构化token布局，空间感知合并算法维持相对位置，以及新颖的最大幅度维度token表示来保留显著特征。

Result: 在SAM-H上实现1.25倍加速且仅0.7% mIOU下降，在DeiT-B上实现1.15倍加速且无top-1准确率损失。

Conclusion: 该方法在空间和非空间架构上均达到最先进水平，支持即插即用和微调两种使用方式，在各种视觉任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Many modern ViT backbones adopt spatial architectural designs, such as window
attention, decomposed relative positional embeddings in SAM, and RoPE in
DINOv3. Such architectures impose new challenges on token reduction, as the
vast majority of existing methods fail to preserve the spatial structure these
architectures depend on. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective
token merging method that maintains spatial integrity, enabling seamless
compatibility with spatial architectures. We reconcile two seemingly
conflicting requirements: (i)exploiting the uneven information distribution
across the spatial layout while (ii)preserving the spatial structure
post-merging. Our approach employs (i)a 2D reduction strategy to enforce
structured token layouts, (ii)a spatial-aware merging algorithm that maintains
relative token positions, and (iii)a novel max-magnitude-per-dimension token
representation that preserves salient features. Our method demonstrates strong
performance both off-the-shelf and with fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art
results on spatial and non-spatial architectures across various vision tasks.
Specifically, we achieve 1.25x speedup on SAM-H with only 0.7% mIOU drop
evaluated on COCO off-the-shelf, and 1.15x speedup on DeiT-B with no top-1
accuracy drop on ImageNet within just one epoch of fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 提出了GASP-ICL框架，一种无需训练的多模态深度伪造检测方法，通过引导式自适应评分和传播上下文学习来增强大型视觉语言模型的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型在多模态深度伪造检测中存在局限性，难以捕捉细微伪造线索、解决跨模态不一致性以及执行任务对齐检索。

Method: 使用MDD适配的特征提取器检索对齐的图像-文本对构建候选集，设计图结构泰勒自适应评分器（GSTAS）捕捉跨样本关系并传播查询对齐信号，生成判别性示例。

Result: 在四种伪造类型上的实验表明，GASP-ICL超越了强基线方法，在不进行LVLM微调的情况下实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: GASP-ICL通过精确选择语义对齐、任务相关的演示，增强了大型视觉语言模型在多模态深度伪造检测中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal deepfake detection (MDD) aims to uncover manipulations across
visual, textual, and auditory modalities, thereby reinforcing the reliability
of modern information systems. Although large vision-language models (LVLMs)
exhibit strong multimodal reasoning, their effectiveness in MDD is limited by
challenges in capturing subtle forgery cues, resolving cross-modal
inconsistencies, and performing task-aligned retrieval. To this end, we propose
Guided Adaptive Scorer and Propagation In-Context Learning (GASP-ICL), a
training-free framework for MDD. GASP-ICL employs a pipeline to preserve
semantic relevance while injecting task-aware knowledge into LVLMs. We leverage
an MDD-adapted feature extractor to retrieve aligned image-text pairs and build
a candidate set. We further design the Graph-Structured Taylor Adaptive Scorer
(GSTAS) to capture cross-sample relations and propagate query-aligned signals,
producing discriminative exemplars. This enables precise selection of
semantically aligned, task-relevant demonstrations, enhancing LVLMs for robust
MDD. Experiments on four forgery types show that GASP-ICL surpasses strong
baselines, delivering gains without LVLM fine-tuning.

Motivation: 现有方法提取统一特征处理视频中的所有动作，难以在多动作场景中建模不同对象间的交互，需要解耦复杂场景中的特定动作。

Method: 使用时空场景图(SSGs)和动态提示模块(DPM)引导图解析神经网络(GPNN)生成动作特定表示，并设计视频适应的GPNN使用动态权重聚合信息。

Abstract: Action recognition is a fundamental task in video understanding. Existing
methods typically extract unified features to process all actions in one video,
which makes it challenging to model the interactions between different objects
in multi-action scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we explore disentangling
any specified actions from complex scenes as an effective solution. In this
paper, we propose Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action
Recognition (ProDA), a novel framework that disentangles any specified actions
from a multi-action scene. ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs)
and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural
Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. Furthermore, we
design a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights.
Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach when compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Our code can be found

Abstract: The rise in harmful online content not only distorts public discourse but
also poses significant challenges to maintaining a healthy digital environment.
In response to this, we introduce a multimodal dataset uniquely crafted for
identifying hate in digital content. Central to our methodology is the
innovative application of watermarked, stability-enhanced, stable diffusion
techniques combined with the Digital Attention Analysis Module (DAAM). This
combination is instrumental in pinpointing the hateful elements within images,
thereby generating detailed hate attention maps, which are used to blur these
regions from the image, thereby removing the hateful sections of the image. We
release this data set as a part of the dehate shared task. This paper also
describes the details of the shared task. Furthermore, we present DeHater, a
vision-language model designed for multimodal dehatification tasks. Our
approach sets a new standard in AI-driven image hate detection given textual

Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型在多图像推理方面存在两个关键挑战：缺乏跨图像推理能力和不足的跨图像参考奖励建模。

Method: 提出两阶段训练范式：结合带标注轨迹的监督微调和图像感知强化学习优化；创新性地构建轨迹数据方法，集成对象级和图像级标注信息；设计具有对象和图像双重奖励函数的图像感知RL策略。

Conclusion: MIRG-RL框架有效解决了多图像推理和定位问题，通过渐进式训练方法和创新的数据构建方法显著提升了跨图像推理能力。

Abstract: Multi-image reasoning and grounding require understanding complex cross-image
relationships at both object levels and image levels. Current Large Visual
Language Models (LVLMs) face two critical challenges: the lack of cross-image
reasoning capabilities and insufficient cross-image reference reward modeling.
To address these issues, we propose a unified framework - Multi-Image Reasoning
and Grounding with Reinforcement Learning (MIRG-RL). Specifically, our
two-stage training paradigm combines supervised fine-tuning with annotated
trajectories and image-aware reinforcement learning optimization, progressively
developing multi-image reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we innovatively
propose a method for constructing the trajectory data, which integrates
object-level and image-level annotation information, and use this method to
generate a lightweight reasoning-enhanced dataset. To effectively resolve
cross-image ambiguities, we design an image-aware RL policy with dual reward
functions for objects and images. Experiments demonstrate that MIRG-RL achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multi-image grounding benchmarks,
attaining 64.82% on cross-image reasoning tasks - exceeding the previous best
method by 1%. The code and dataset have been released at

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在扩展推演中实现了稳定一致的长时程生成。

Conclusion: LongScape通过创新的分块和专家混合机制，有效解决了长时程视频生成的稳定性问题。

Abstract: Video-based world models hold significant potential for generating
high-quality embodied manipulation data. However, current video generation
methods struggle to achieve stable long-horizon generation: classical
diffusion-based approaches often suffer from temporal inconsistency and visual
drift over multiple rollouts, while autoregressive methods tend to compromise
on visual detail. To solve this, we introduce LongScape, a hybrid framework
that adaptively combines intra-chunk diffusion denoising with inter-chunk
autoregressive causal generation. Our core innovation is an action-guided,
variable-length chunking mechanism that partitions video based on the semantic
context of robotic actions. This ensures each chunk represents a complete,
coherent action, enabling the model to flexibly generate diverse dynamics. We
further introduce a Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (CMoE) framework that
adaptively activates specialized experts for each chunk during generation,
guaranteeing high visual quality and seamless chunk transitions. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves stable and consistent
long-horizon generation over extended rollouts. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: MoWM通过融合不同特征空间的优势，为具身规划提供了有效解决方案，同时为未来研究提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Embodied action planning is a core challenge in robotics, requiring models to
generate precise actions from visual observations and language instructions.
While video generation world models are promising, their reliance on
pixel-level reconstruction often introduces visual redundancies that hinder
action decoding and generalization. Latent world models offer a compact,
motion-aware representation, but overlook the fine-grained details critical for
precise manipulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoWM, a
mixture-of-world-model framework that fuses representations from hybrid world
models for embodied action planning. Our approach uses motion-aware
representations from a latent model as a high-level prior, which guides the
extraction of fine-grained visual features from the pixel space model. This
design allows MoWM to highlight the informative visual details needed for
action decoding. Extensive evaluations on the CALVIN benchmark demonstrate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art task success rates and superior
generalization. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the strengths of
each feature space, offering valuable insights for future research in embodied
planning. The code is available at: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/MoWM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹控制方法要么需要大量训练资源，要么专门为U-Net设计，未能利用DiT的优越性能。需要一种简单有效的训练免费方法来实现DiT中的轨迹控制。

Method: 1) 前景-背景分离引导：使用LLM将用户提示转换为前景和背景提示，分别指导视频中前景和背景区域的生成；2) 空间-时间解耦3D-RoPE：通过修改前景token的位置嵌入，消除跨帧空间差异，增强跨帧注意力；3) 通过调节位置嵌入密度实现3D感知轨迹控制。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在视频质量和轨迹可控性方面均优于先前方法。

Conclusion: DiTraj是一种简单有效的训练免费框架，成功实现了DiT中的轨迹控制，在保持视频质量的同时提供了精确的轨迹控制能力。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT)-based video generation models with 3D full
attention exhibit strong generative capabilities. Trajectory control represents
a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation. However,
existing methods either require substantial training resources or are
specifically designed for U-Net, do not take advantage of the superior
performance of DiT. To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but
effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video
generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's
trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the
Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and
background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and
background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore
the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position
embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled
3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding,
STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening
cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control.
Additionally, we achieve 3D-aware trajectory control by regulating the density
of position embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory
controllability.

Method: 在检索增强生成框架中比较余弦相似度、最大边际相关性和混合方法（结合稠密嵌入、词汇重叠和重排序），并采用EfficientRAG管道进行查询优化。

Conclusion: 混合检索增强生成为多跳问答提供了实用的零样本解决方案，平衡了准确性、效率和可解释性。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have advanced the field of question answering, but
multi-hop reasoning, where answers require combining evidence across multiple
passages, remains difficult. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of
retrieval strategies for multi-hop question answering within a
retrieval-augmented generation framework. We compare cosine similarity, maximal
marginal relevance, and a hybrid method that integrates dense embeddings with
lexical overlap and re-ranking. To further improve retrieval, we adapt the
EfficientRAG pipeline for query optimization, introducing token labeling and
iterative refinement while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on the HotpotQA
dataset show that the hybrid approach substantially outperforms baseline
methods, achieving a relative improvement of 50 percent in exact match and 47
percent in F1 score compared to cosine similarity. Error analysis reveals that
hybrid retrieval improves entity recall and evidence complementarity, while
remaining limited in handling distractors and temporal reasoning. Overall, the
results suggest that hybrid retrieval-augmented generation provides a practical
zero-shot solution for multi-hop question answering, balancing accuracy,
efficiency, and interpretability.

Motivation: 现有HDR新视角合成方法主要关注静态场景，但现实场景常包含动态元素如移动物体和变化光照，需要联合建模时间辐射变化和3D转换。

Method: 基于高斯泼溅的HDR-4DGS架构，配备创新的动态色调映射模块，根据时间维度上辐射分布变化动态调整色调映射函数。

Result: HDR-4DGS在定量性能和视觉保真度上均超越现有最先进方法，能够从任意视角和时间实例生成逼真的HDR渲染。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了HDR动态新视角合成的复杂挑战，实现了时间辐射一致性和精确色彩转换。

Abstract: High Dynamic Range Novel View Synthesis (HDR NVS) seeks to learn an HDR 3D
model from Low Dynamic Range (LDR) training images captured under conventional
imaging conditions. Current methods primarily focus on static scenes,
implicitly assuming all scene elements remain stationary and non-living.
However, real-world scenarios frequently feature dynamic elements, such as
moving objects, varying lighting conditions, and other temporal events, thereby
presenting a significantly more challenging scenario. To address this gap, we
propose a more realistic problem named HDR Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (HDR
DNVS), where the additional dimension ``Dynamic'' emphasizes the necessity of
jointly modeling temporal radiance variations alongside sophisticated 3D
translation between LDR and HDR. To tackle this complex, intertwined challenge,
we introduce HDR-4DGS, a Gaussian Splatting-based architecture featured with an
innovative dynamic tone-mapping module that explicitly connects HDR and LDR
domains, maintaining temporal radiance coherence by dynamically adapting
tone-mapping functions according to the evolving radiance distributions across
the temporal dimension. As a result, HDR-4DGS achieves both temporal radiance
consistency and spatially accurate color translation, enabling photorealistic
HDR renderings from arbitrary viewpoints and time instances. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that HDR-4DGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art
methods in both quantitative performance and visual fidelity. Source code will
be released.

Conclusion: SRHand能够从低分辨率图像重建出包含皱纹、指甲等细节的精细3D手部几何和纹理图像。

Abstract: Reconstructing detailed hand avatars plays a crucial role in various
applications. While prior works have focused on capturing high-fidelity hand
geometry, they heavily rely on high-resolution multi-view image inputs and
struggle to generalize on low-resolution images. Multi-view image
super-resolution methods have been proposed to enforce 3D view consistency.
These methods, however, are limited to static objects/scenes with fixed
resolutions and are not applicable to articulated deformable hands. In this
paper, we propose SRHand (Super-Resolution Hand), the method for reconstructing
detailed 3D geometry as well as textured images of hands from low-resolution
images. SRHand leverages the advantages of implicit image representation with
explicit hand meshes. Specifically, we introduce a geometric-aware implicit
image function (GIIF) that learns detailed hand prior by upsampling the coarse
input images. By jointly optimizing the implicit image function and explicit 3D
hand shapes, our method preserves multi-view and pose consistency among
upsampled hand images, and achieves fine-detailed 3D reconstruction (wrinkles,
nails). In experiments using the InterHand2.6M and Goliath datasets, our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image upsampling methods adapted to
hand datasets, and 3D hand reconstruction methods, quantitatively and
qualitatively. Project page: https://yunminjin2.github.io/projects/srhand

Abstract: The wide availability and low usability barrier of modern image generation
models has triggered the reasonable fear of criminal misconduct and negative
social implications. The machine learning community has been engaging this
problem with an extensive series of publications proposing algorithmic
solutions for the detection of "fake", e.g. entirely generated or partially
manipulated images. While there is undoubtedly some progress towards technical
solutions of the problem, we argue that current and prior work is focusing too
much on generative algorithms and "fake" data-samples, neglecting a clear
definition and data collection of "real" images. The fundamental question "what
is a real image?" might appear to be quite philosophical, but our analysis
shows that the development and evaluation of basically all current
"fake"-detection methods is relying on only a few, quite old low-resolution
datasets of "real" images like ImageNet. However, the technology for the
acquisition of "real" images, aka taking photos, has drastically evolved over
the last decade: Today, over 90% of all photographs are produced by smartphones
which typically use algorithms to compute an image from multiple inputs (over
time) from multiple sensors. Based on the fact that these image formation
algorithms are typically neural network architectures which are closely related
to "fake"-image generators, we state the position that today, we need to
re-think the concept of "real" images. The purpose of this position paper is to
raise the awareness of the current shortcomings in this active field of
research and to trigger an open discussion whether the detection of "fake"
images is a sound objective at all. At the very least, we need a clear
technical definition of "real" images and new benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Aes-R1能够在统一框架中增强美学评分和推理，生成有依据的解释和可靠的分数，超越了同类规模的先进基线方法。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are well suited to image aesthetic
assessment, as they can capture high-level aesthetic features leveraging their
cross-modal understanding capacity. However, the scarcity of multimodal
aesthetic reasoning data and the inherently subjective nature of aesthetic
judgment make it difficult for MLLMs to generate accurate aesthetic judgments
with interpretable rationales. To this end, we propose Aes-R1, a comprehensive
aesthetic reasoning framework with reinforcement learning (RL). Concretely,
Aes-R1 integrates a pipeline, AesCoT, to construct and filter high-quality
chain-of-thought aesthetic reasoning data used for cold-start. After teaching
the model to generate structured explanations prior to scoring, we then employ
the Relative-Absolute Policy Optimization (RAPO), a novel RL algorithm that
jointly optimizes absolute score regression and relative ranking order,
improving both per-image accuracy and cross-image preference judgments. Aes-R1
enables MLLMs to generate grounded explanations alongside faithful scores,
thereby enhancing aesthetic scoring and reasoning in a unified framework.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Aes-R1 improves the backbone's average
PLCC/SRCC by 47.9%/34.8%, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines of similar
size. More ablation studies validate Aes-R1's robust generalization under
limited supervision and in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Abstract: The visual dubbing task aims to generate mouth movements synchronized with
the driving audio, which has seen significant progress in recent years.
However, two critical deficiencies hinder their wide application: (1)
Audio-only driving paradigms inadequately capture speaker-specific lip habits,
which fail to generate lip movements similar to the target avatar; (2)
Conventional blind-inpainting approaches frequently produce visual artifacts
when handling obstructions (e.g., microphones, hands), limiting practical
deployment. In this paper, we propose StableDub, a novel and concise framework
integrating lip-habit-aware modeling with occlusion-robust synthesis.
Specifically, building upon the Stable-Diffusion backbone, we develop a
lip-habit-modulated mechanism that jointly models phonemic audio-visual
synchronization and speaker-specific orofacial dynamics. To achieve plausible
lip geometries and object appearances under occlusion, we introduce the
occlusion-aware training strategy by explicitly exposing the occlusion objects
to the inpainting process. By incorporating the proposed designs, the model
eliminates the necessity for cost-intensive priors in previous methods, thereby
exhibiting superior training efficiency on the computationally intensive
diffusion-based backbone. To further optimize training efficiency from the
perspective of model architecture, we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer
architecture, which demonstrates the enhanced applicability in low-resource
research scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that StableDub
achieves superior performance in lip habit resemblance and occlusion
robustness. Our method also surpasses other methods in audio-lip sync, video
quality, and resolution consistency. We expand the applicability of visual
dubbing methods from comprehensive aspects, and demo videos can be found at

Conclusion: Drag4D提供了一个统一的架构，成功实现了文本驱动3D场景中物体运动的精确控制，展示了在3D场景生成与动画集成方面的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce Drag4D, an interactive framework that integrates object motion
control within text-driven 3D scene generation. This framework enables users to
define 3D trajectories for the 3D objects generated from a single image,
seamlessly integrating them into a high-quality 3D background. Our Drag4D
pipeline consists of three stages. First, we enhance text-to-3D background
generation by applying 2D Gaussian Splatting with panoramic images and
inpainted novel views, resulting in dense and visually complete 3D
reconstructions. In the second stage, given a reference image of the target
object, we introduce a 3D copy-and-paste approach: the target instance is
extracted in a full 3D mesh using an off-the-shelf image-to-3D model and
seamlessly composited into the generated 3D scene. The object mesh is then
positioned within the 3D scene via our physics-aware object position learning,
ensuring precise spatial alignment. Lastly, the spatially aligned object is
temporally animated along a user-defined 3D trajectory. To mitigate motion
hallucination and ensure view-consistent temporal alignment, we develop a
part-augmented, motion-conditioned video diffusion model that processes
multiview image pairs together with their projected 2D trajectories. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified architecture through evaluations
at each stage and in the final results, showcasing the harmonized alignment of
user-controlled object motion within a high-quality 3D background.

*Jibin Song,Mingi Kwon,Jaeseok Jeong,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Syncphony是一个音频到视频生成模型，通过运动感知损失和音频同步引导技术，生成与音频精确同步的高质量视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频和图像到视频生成方法在控制运动时序方面存在局限，而音频提供了与视频运动对齐的时间线索，是时序控制视频生成的有前景条件。

Method: 基于预训练视频骨干网络，引入两个关键组件：运动感知损失（强调高运动区域学习）和音频同步引导（使用视觉对齐的无音频层模型指导全模型）。

Result: 在AVSync15和The Greatest Hits数据集上的实验表明，Syncphony在同步精度和视觉质量方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Syncphony通过创新的同步机制成功实现了音频驱动的时序精确视频生成，在同步性和视觉质量方面都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Text-to-video and image-to-video generation have made rapid progress in
visual quality, but they remain limited in controlling the precise timing of
motion. In contrast, audio provides temporal cues aligned with video motion,
making it a promising condition for temporally controlled video generation.
However, existing audio-to-video (A2V) models struggle with fine-grained
synchronization due to indirect conditioning mechanisms or limited temporal
modeling capacity. We present Syncphony, which generates 380x640 resolution,
24fps videos synchronized with diverse audio inputs. Our approach builds upon a
pre-trained video backbone and incorporates two key components to improve
synchronization: (1) Motion-aware Loss, which emphasizes learning at
high-motion regions; (2) Audio Sync Guidance, which guides the full model using
a visually aligned off-sync model without audio layers to better exploit audio
cues at inference while maintaining visual quality. To evaluate
synchronization, we propose CycleSync, a video-to-audio-based metric that
measures the amount of motion cues in the generated video to reconstruct the
original audio. Experiments on AVSync15 and The Greatest Hits datasets
demonstrate that Syncphony outperforms existing methods in both synchronization
accuracy and visual quality. Project page is available at:

*Yixiao Liu,Yizhou Yang,Jinwen Li,Jun Tao,Ruoyu Li,Xiangkun Wang,Min Zhu,Junlong Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种语言引导的遥感变化检测模型LG-CD，通过自然语言提示引导网络关注感兴趣区域，利用视觉基础模型SAM2提取多尺度特征，并结合文本融合注意力模块和视觉语义融合解码器，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的变化检测方法主要关注单模态视觉信息，忽略了文本等多模态数据提供的丰富语义信息，限制了检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 使用SAM2作为特征提取器获取双时相遥感图像的多尺度金字塔特征；采用多层适配器进行下游任务微调；设计文本融合注意力模块对齐视觉和文本信息；实现视觉语义融合解码器通过交叉注意力机制深度融合视觉和语义信息。

Result: 在LEVIR-CD、WHU-CD和SYSU-CD三个数据集上的实验表明，LG-CD持续优于最先进的变化检测方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用多模态信息为实现广义变化检测提供了新的思路，证明了语言引导在提升变化检测性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: Remote Sensing Change Detection (RSCD) typically identifies changes in land
cover or surface conditions by analyzing multi-temporal images. Currently, most
deep learning-based methods primarily focus on learning unimodal visual
information, while neglecting the rich semantic information provided by
multimodal data such as text. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
Language-Guided Change Detection model (LG-CD). This model leverages natural
language prompts to direct the network's attention to regions of interest,
significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of change detection.
Specifically, LG-CD utilizes a visual foundational model (SAM2) as a feature
extractor to capture multi-scale pyramid features from high-resolution to
low-resolution across bi-temporal remote sensing images. Subsequently,
multi-layer adapters are employed to fine-tune the model for downstream tasks,
ensuring its effectiveness in remote sensing change detection. Additionally, we
design a Text Fusion Attention Module (TFAM) to align visual and textual
information, enabling the model to focus on target change regions using text
prompts. Finally, a Vision-Semantic Fusion Decoder (V-SFD) is implemented,
which deeply integrates visual and semantic information through a
cross-attention mechanism to produce highly accurate change detection masks.
Our experiments on three datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD) demonstrate
that LG-CD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art change detection methods.
Furthermore, our approach provides new insights into achieving generalized
change detection by leveraging multimodal information.

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合文本和拖拽控制的图像编辑框架，结合了文本驱动的纹理编辑和拖拽驱动的空间控制优势，通过点云确定性拖拽和拖拽文本引导去噪实现高保真联合编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本驱动方法擅长纹理操作但缺乏精确空间控制，拖拽驱动方法主要修改形状结构但缺乏细粒度纹理指导，需要结合两者优势解决互补局限性。

Method: 基于扩散的统一框架，包含点云确定性拖拽（通过3D特征映射增强潜在空间布局控制）和拖拽文本引导去噪（在去噪过程中动态平衡拖拽和文本条件的影响）。

Result: 支持灵活编辑模式（仅文本、仅拖拽或组合条件），在联合编辑中实现高保真效果，在单独文本或拖拽设置下也匹配或超越专门方法性能。

Conclusion: 建立了一个多功能且可推广的可控图像操作解决方案，通过统一框架成功整合了文本和拖拽编辑的优势。

Abstract: This paper explores image editing under the joint control of text and drag
interactions. While recent advances in text-driven and drag-driven editing have
achieved remarkable progress, they suffer from complementary limitations:
text-driven methods excel in texture manipulation but lack precise spatial
control, whereas drag-driven approaches primarily modify shape and structure
without fine-grained texture guidance. To address these limitations, we propose
a unified diffusion-based framework for joint drag-text image editing,
integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Our framework introduces two key
innovations: (1) Point-Cloud Deterministic Drag, which enhances latent-space
layout control through 3D feature mapping, and (2) Drag-Text Guided Denoising,
dynamically balancing the influence of drag and text conditions during
denoising. Notably, our model supports flexible editing modes - operating with
text-only, drag-only, or combined conditions - while maintaining strong
performance in each setting. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method not only achieves high-fidelity joint editing but
also matches or surpasses the performance of specialized text-only or drag-only
approaches, establishing a versatile and generalizable solution for
controllable image manipulation. Code will be made publicly available to
reproduce all results presented in this work.

Motivation: 北欧地区无人机图像中的车辆检测面临强能见度挑战和雪覆盖导致的域偏移问题，虽然标注数据昂贵但未标注数据获取成本较低

Method: 在预训练阶段通过对比学习训练CNN表示提取器，然后在微调阶段将其侧载到冻结的YOLO11n骨干网络中，比较了多种融合方法和粒度

Result: 在NVD数据集上，提出的sideload-CL-adaptation模型将检测性能提升了3.8%到9.5%（以mAP50衡量）

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用未标注数据改善了车辆检测性能，特别适用于北欧地区具有挑战性的环境条件

Abstract: Aside from common challenges in remote sensing like small, sparse targets and
computation cost limitations, detecting vehicles from UAV images in the Nordic
regions faces strong visibility challenges and domain shifts caused by diverse
levels of snow coverage. Although annotated data are expensive, unannotated
data is cheaper to obtain by simply flying the drones. In this work, we
proposed a sideload-CL-adaptation framework that enables the use of unannotated
data to improve vehicle detection using lightweight models. Specifically, we
propose to train a CNN-based representation extractor through contrastive
learning on the unannotated data in the pretraining stage, and then sideload it
to a frozen YOLO11n backbone in the fine-tuning stage. To find a robust
sideload-CL-adaptation, we conducted extensive experiments to compare various
fusion methods and granularity. Our proposed sideload-CL-adaptation model
improves the detection performance by 3.8% to 9.5% in terms of mAP50 on the NVD
dataset.

Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法需要特定模型的反演或大量优化，限制了利用最新图像到视频模型将图像编辑能力迁移到视频领域的能力。

Method: 提出向量场校正与样本偏差来绕过反演，引入结构运动保持初始化生成运动感知的时序相关噪声，并采用偏差缓存机制最小化计算成本。

Result: 评估显示该方法在编辑质量和一致性方面优于现有方法，提供了轻量级的即插即用解决方案。

Conclusion: IF-V2V为视频编辑提供了一种高效且无需反演的方法，能够有效利用现有图像到视频模型实现视觉创意。

Abstract: Although image editing techniques have advanced significantly, video editing,
which aims to manipulate videos according to user intent, remains an emerging
challenge. Most existing image-conditioned video editing methods either require
inversion with model-specific design or need extensive optimization, limiting
their capability of leveraging up-to-date image-to-video (I2V) models to
transfer the editing capability of image editing models to the video domain. To
this end, we propose IF-V2V, an Inversion-Free method that can adapt
off-the-shelf flow-matching-based I2V models for video editing without
significant computational overhead. To circumvent inversion, we devise Vector
Field Rectification with Sample Deviation to incorporate information from the
source video into the denoising process by introducing a deviation term into
the denoising vector field. To further ensure consistency with the source video
in a model-agnostic way, we introduce Structure-and-Motion-Preserving
Initialization to generate motion-aware temporally correlated noise with
structural information embedded. We also present a Deviation Caching mechanism
to minimize the additional computational cost for denoising vector
rectification without significantly impacting editing quality. Evaluations
demonstrate that our method achieves superior editing quality and consistency
over existing approaches, offering a lightweight plug-and-play solution to
realize visual creativity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多视角计数方法依赖全监督学习，需要大量标注数据，这限制了其应用。本文旨在通过自监督学习减轻对标注数据的依赖。

Method: 提出SSLCounter框架，利用神经体渲染学习场景的隐式表示，通过微分神经渲染重建连续几何形状和复杂视角相关的2D投影外观。

Result: 在多个多视角计数基准测试中，SSLCounter不仅达到最先进性能，而且仅使用70%训练数据就能获得竞争性结果，展示了卓越的数据效率。

Conclusion: SSLCounter通过自监督学习和神经体渲染，有效解决了多视角计数对标注数据的依赖问题，具有出色的数据效率和性能表现。

Abstract: Multi-view counting (MVC) methods have attracted significant research
attention and stimulated remarkable progress in recent years. Despite their
success, most MVC methods have focused on improving performance by following
the fully supervised learning (FSL) paradigm, which often requires large
amounts of annotated data. In this work, we propose SSLCounter, a novel
self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for MVC that leverages neural
volumetric rendering to alleviate the reliance on large-scale annotated
datasets. SSLCounter learns an implicit representation w.r.t. the scene,
enabling the reconstruction of continuous geometry shape and the complex,
view-dependent appearance of their 2D projections via differential neural
rendering. Owing to its inherent flexibility, the key idea of our method can be
seamlessly integrated into exsiting frameworks. Notably, extensive experiments
demonstrate that SSLCounter not only demonstrates state-of-the-art performances
but also delivers competitive performance with only using 70% proportion of
training data, showcasing its superior data efficiency across multiple MVC
benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有的大多数基准测试强调定位精度，而忽略了模型是否真正理解场景中物体的排列和关系，这对有效的场景理解至关重要

Method: 使用受控合成数据集，评估了最先进的视觉模型（如GroundingDINO、Florence-2、OWLv2）和大规模视觉语言模型（如InternVL、LLaVA、GPT-4o）在三个任务上的表现：空间定位、空间推理和下游检索任务

Result: 检测器如GroundingDINO和OWLv2提供精确的边界框但关系推理能力有限，而视觉语言模型如SmolVLM和GPT-4o提供粗略的布局线索和流畅的描述但在细粒度空间上下文方面表现不佳

Conclusion: 研究揭示了定位与真正空间理解之间的差距，并指出社区需要开发具有空间感知能力的基础模型

Abstract: Spatial understanding is a critical capability for vision foundation models.
While recent advances in large vision models or vision-language models (VLMs)
have expanded recognition capabilities, most benchmarks emphasize localization
accuracy rather than whether models capture how objects are arranged and
related within a scene. This gap is consequential; effective scene
understanding requires not only identifying objects, but reasoning about their
relative positions, groupings, and depth. In this paper, we present a
systematic benchmark for object-centric spatial reasoning in foundation models.
Using a controlled synthetic dataset, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision
models (e.g., GroundingDINO, Florence-2, OWLv2) and large VLMs (e.g., InternVL,
LLaVA, GPT-4o) across three tasks: spatial localization, spatial reasoning, and
downstream retrieval tasks. We find a stable trade-off: detectors such as
GroundingDINO and OWLv2 deliver precise boxes with limited relational
reasoning, while VLMs like SmolVLM and GPT-4o provide coarse layout cues and
fluent captions but struggle with fine-grained spatial context. Our study
highlights the gap between localization and true spatial understanding, and
pointing toward the need for spatially-aware foundation models in the
community.

TL;DR: PANICL是一个无需训练的训练框架，通过利用多个上下文图像对来缓解视觉上下文学习中过度依赖单个上下文对的问题，提高预测的稳定性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉上下文学习(VICL)通常过度依赖单个上下文图像对，导致预测结果存在偏差和不稳定性。

Method: 提出了基于补丁的k近邻视觉上下文学习(PANICL)框架，通过平滑多个上下文对之间的分配分数来减少偏差，无需额外训练。

Result: 在多种视觉任务上的实验表明，PANICL相比强基线方法有持续改进，对领域偏移具有强鲁棒性，并能泛化到其他VICL模型。

Conclusion: PANICL是一个通用且广泛适用的框架，能够有效提升视觉上下文学习的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) uses input-output image pairs, referred to
as in-context pairs (or examples), as prompts alongside query images to guide
models in performing diverse vision tasks. However, VICL often suffers from
over-reliance on a single in-context pair, which can lead to biased and
unstable predictions. We introduce PAtch-based $k$-Nearest neighbor visual
In-Context Learning (PANICL), a general training-free framework that mitigates
this issue by leveraging multiple in-context pairs. PANICL smooths assignment
scores across pairs, reducing bias without requiring additional training.
Extensive experiments on a variety of tasks, including foreground segmentation,
single object detection, colorization, multi-object segmentation, and keypoint
detection, demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Moreover,
PANICL exhibits strong robustness to domain shifts, including dataset-level
shift (e.g., from COCO to Pascal) and label-space shift (e.g., FSS-1000), and
generalizes well to other VICL models such as SegGPT, Painter, and LVM,
highlighting its versatility and broad applicability.

TL;DR: SingRef6D是一个轻量级的6D姿态估计方法，仅需单张RGB参考图像，无需深度传感器或多视角图像，通过改进的深度预测和深度感知匹配技术，在挑战性表面和光照条件下表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计方法依赖深度传感器（对透明/反光表面失效）或RGB方法（在低光/无纹理场景中匹配性能差），需要一种在资源受限环境下仍能稳健工作的解决方案。

Method: 1. 基于Depth-Anything v2提出token-scaler微调机制和新优化损失，提升挑战性表面的深度预测精度；2. 引入深度感知匹配过程，在LoFTR中整合空间关系，处理挑战性材料和光照条件的匹配。

Result: 在REAL275深度预测上相比Depth-Anything v2提升14.41%（δ1.05指标）；在REAL275、ClearPose和Toyota-Light数据集上的姿态估计平均召回率提升6.1%，超越现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: SingRef6D证明了仅使用单张RGB参考图像即可实现稳健的6D姿态估计，在资源受限和挑战性环境下具有显著优势。

Abstract: Recent 6D pose estimation methods demonstrate notable performance but still
face some practical limitations. For instance, many of them rely heavily on
sensor depth, which may fail with challenging surface conditions, such as
transparent or highly reflective materials. In the meantime, RGB-based
solutions provide less robust matching performance in low-light and
texture-less scenes due to the lack of geometry information. Motivated by
these, we propose SingRef6D, a lightweight pipeline requiring only a single RGB
image as a reference, eliminating the need for costly depth sensors, multi-view
image acquisition, or training view synthesis models and neural fields. This
enables SingRef6D to remain robust and capable even under resource-limited
settings where depth or dense templates are unavailable. Our framework
incorporates two key innovations. First, we propose a token-scaler-based
fine-tuning mechanism with a novel optimization loss on top of Depth-Anything
v2 to enhance its ability to predict accurate depth, even for challenging
surfaces. Our results show a 14.41% improvement (in $\delta_{1.05}$) on REAL275
depth prediction compared to Depth-Anything v2 (with fine-tuned head). Second,
benefiting from depth availability, we introduce a depth-aware matching process
that effectively integrates spatial relationships within LoFTR, enabling our
system to handle matching for challenging materials and lighting conditions.
Evaluations of pose estimation on the REAL275, ClearPose, and Toyota-Light
datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving a
6.1% improvement in average recall.

Conclusion: DynaNav通过动态特征和层选择机制，在显著降低计算资源消耗的同时提高了视觉导航的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Visual navigation is essential for robotics and embodied AI. However,
existing foundation models, particularly those with transformer decoders,
suffer from high computational overhead and lack interpretability, limiting
their deployment in resource-tight scenarios. To address this, we propose
DynaNav, a Dynamic Visual Navigation framework that adapts feature and layer
selection based on scene complexity. It employs a trainable hard feature
selector for sparse operations, enhancing efficiency and interpretability.
Additionally, we integrate feature selection into an early-exit mechanism, with
Bayesian Optimization determining optimal exit thresholds to reduce
computational cost. Extensive experiments in real-world-based datasets and
simulated environments demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaNav. Compared to
ViNT, DynaNav achieves a 2.26x reduction in FLOPs, 42.3% lower inference time,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ControlNet依赖与生成目标精确对齐的视觉条件，但在实际应用中，特别是对于不常见或想象性场景，往往缺乏合适的视觉条件。现有方法难以使用语义相关但不对齐的视觉条件。

Method: 训练免费方法，首先使用与视觉条件对齐的替代提示进行辅助去噪过程提取注意力掩码，然后在实际目标提示的去噪过程中利用这些掩码来抑制冲突区域的视觉条件影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在各种视觉条件（深度图、边缘图、人体骨架）下，在不对齐条件下均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SemanticControl能够有效利用语义相关但不对齐的视觉条件，提高文本到图像生成的质量和保真度。

Abstract: ControlNet has enabled detailed spatial control in text-to-image diffusion
models by incorporating additional visual conditions such as depth or edge
maps. However, its effectiveness heavily depends on the availability of visual
conditions that are precisely aligned with the generation goal specified by
text prompt-a requirement that often fails in practice, especially for uncommon
or imaginative scenes. For example, generating an image of a cat cooking in a
specific pose may be infeasible due to the lack of suitable visual conditions.
In contrast, structurally similar cues can often be found in more common
settings-for instance, poses of humans cooking are widely available and can
serve as rough visual guides. Unfortunately, existing ControlNet models
struggle to use such loosely aligned visual conditions, often resulting in low
text fidelity or visual artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose
SemanticControl, a training-free method for effectively leveraging misaligned
but semantically relevant visual conditions. Our approach adaptively suppresses
the influence of the visual condition where it conflicts with the prompt, while
strengthening guidance from the text. The key idea is to first run an auxiliary
denoising process using a surrogate prompt aligned with the visual condition
(e.g., "a human playing guitar" for a human pose condition) to extract
informative attention masks, and then utilize these masks during the denoising
of the actual target prompt (e.g., cat playing guitar). Experimental results
demonstrate that our method improves performance under loosely aligned
conditions across various conditions, including depth maps, edge maps, and
human skeletons, outperforming existing baselines. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有评估方法存在限制，包括忽略合理回答、有限的情感分类、忽视情境因素和劳动密集型标注，需要开发更有效的评估框架来准确衡量MLLMs的情感感知能力。

Method: 设计情感陈述判断任务，并开发自动化流程高效构建情感中心陈述，最小化人工参与，系统评估主流MLLMs的情感感知表现。

Result: MLLMs在情感解释和情境情感判断方面表现较强，但在理解感知主观性方面相对有限；与人类相比，即使是GPT4o等顶级模型也存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: 通过开发基础评估框架和进行全面的MLLM评估，这项工作有助于推进MLLMs的情感智能发展，揭示了未来改进的关键领域。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved exceptional
performance across diverse tasks, continually surpassing previous expectations
regarding their capabilities. Nevertheless, their proficiency in perceiving
emotions from images remains debated, with studies yielding divergent results
in zero-shot scenarios. We argue that this inconsistency stems partly from
constraints in existing evaluation methods, including the oversight of
plausible responses, limited emotional taxonomies, neglect of contextual
factors, and labor-intensive annotations. To facilitate customized visual
emotion evaluation for MLLMs, we propose an Emotion Statement Judgment task
that overcomes these constraints. Complementing this task, we devise an
automated pipeline that efficiently constructs emotion-centric statements with
minimal human effort. Through systematically evaluating prevailing MLLMs, our
study showcases their stronger performance in emotion interpretation and
context-based emotion judgment, while revealing relative limitations in
comprehending perception subjectivity. When compared to humans, even
top-performing MLLMs like GPT4o demonstrate remarkable performance gaps,
underscoring key areas for future improvement. By developing a fundamental
evaluation framework and conducting a comprehensive MLLM assessment, we hope
this work contributes to advancing emotional intelligence in MLLMs. Project

their reliance on simple reconstruction-based objectives, leading to both
severe attribute leakage that compromises subject fidelity and failing to align
with nuanced human preferences. To address this, we propose MultiCrafter, a
framework that ensures high-fidelity, preference-aligned generation. First, we
find that the root cause of attribute leakage is a significant entanglement of
attention between different subjects during the generation process. Therefore,
we introduce explicit positional supervision to explicitly separate attention
regions for each subject, effectively mitigating attribute leakage. To enable
the model to accurately plan the attention region of different subjects in
diverse scenarios, we employ a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to enhance the
model's capacity, allowing different experts to focus on different scenarios.
Finally, we design a novel online reinforcement learning framework to align the
model with human preferences, featuring a scoring mechanism to accurately
assess multi-subject fidelity and a more stable training strategy tailored for
the MoE architecture. Experiments validate that our framework significantly
improves subject fidelity while aligning with human preferences better.

TL;DR: PartSAM是首个基于大规模3D数据训练的可提示部件分割模型，采用类似SAM的编码器-解码器架构，在多个基准测试中大幅超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过从2D基础模型转移监督来提升多视角掩码到3D，但无法捕捉内在几何特征，导致表面理解有限、分解不可控和泛化能力差。

Method: 采用基于三平面的双分支编码器生成空间结构化token，结合模型在环标注流程从在线资源中整理超过500万个3D形状-部件对进行大规模监督。

Result: PartSAM在多个基准测试中大幅超越最先进方法，展示了新兴的开放世界能力：通过单一提示实现精确部件识别，在分段所有部件模式下自动分解形状为表面和内部结构。

Conclusion: PartSAM标志着向3D部件理解基础模型的决定性进展，结合可扩展架构和多样化3D数据实现了开放世界能力。

Abstract: Segmenting 3D objects into parts is a long-standing challenge in computer
vision. To overcome taxonomy constraints and generalize to unseen 3D objects,
recent works turn to open-world part segmentation. These approaches typically
transfer supervision from 2D foundation models, such as SAM, by lifting
multi-view masks into 3D. However, this indirect paradigm fails to capture
intrinsic geometry, leading to surface-only understanding, uncontrolled
decomposition, and limited generalization. We present PartSAM, the first
promptable part segmentation model trained natively on large-scale 3D data.
Following the design philosophy of SAM, PartSAM employs an encoder-decoder
architecture in which a triplane-based dual-branch encoder produces spatially
structured tokens for scalable part-aware representation learning. To enable
large-scale supervision, we further introduce a model-in-the-loop annotation
pipeline that curates over five million 3D shape-part pairs from online assets,
providing diverse and fine-grained labels. This combination of scalable
architecture and diverse 3D data yields emergent open-world capabilities: with
a single prompt, PartSAM achieves highly accurate part identification, and in a
Segment-Every-Part mode, it automatically decomposes shapes into both surface
and internal structures. Extensive experiments show that PartSAM outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by large margins across multiple benchmarks, marking a
decisive step toward foundation models for 3D part understanding. Our code and
model will be released soon.

Motivation: 图像对比度是视觉感知的关键因素，但现有无参考图像质量评估模型难以准确评估真实世界条件下的对比度失真。

Method: 定制化微调三个预训练架构（EfficientNet B0、ResNet18、MobileNetV2），添加对比度感知回归头，使用目标数据增强在CID2013和CCID2014数据集上进行端到端训练。

Result: EfficientNet B0模型在CCID2014上达到PLCC=0.9286和SRCC=0.9178，在CID2013上达到PLCC=0.9581和SRCC=0.9369，超越传统方法和深度基线模型。

Abstract: Image contrast was a fundamental factor in visual perception and played a
vital role in overall image quality. However, most no reference image quality
assessment NR IQA models struggled to accurately evaluate contrast distortions
under diverse real world conditions. In this study, we proposed a deep learning
based framework for blind contrast quality assessment by customizing and
fine-tuning three pre trained architectures, EfficientNet B0, ResNet18, and
MobileNetV2, for perceptual Mean Opinion Score, along with an additional model
built on a Siamese network, which indicated a limited ability to capture
perceptual contrast distortions. Each model is modified with a contrast-aware
regression head and trained end to end using targeted data augmentations on two
benchmark datasets, CID2013 and CCID2014, containing synthetic and authentic
contrast distortions. Performance is evaluated using Pearson Linear Correlation
Coefficient and Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient, which assess the
alignment between predicted and human rated scores. Among these three models,
our customized EfficientNet B0 model achieved state-of-the-art performance with
PLCC = 0.9286 and SRCC = 0.9178 on CCID2014 and PLCC = 0.9581 and SRCC = 0.9369
on CID2013, surpassing traditional methods and outperforming other deep
baselines. These results highlighted the models robustness and effectiveness in
capturing perceptual contrast distortion. Overall, the proposed method
demonstrated that contrast aware adaptation of lightweight pre trained networks
can yield a high performing, scalable solution for no reference contrast
quality assessment suitable for real time and resource constrained
applications.

Motivation: 解决遥感图像中指代表达理解在数据稀缺场景下面临的泛化能力不足问题，传统监督微调方法需要大量标注数据，在少样本情况下表现不佳。

Method: 提出推理中心强化微调(RFT)范式Geo-R1，采用"先推理后行动"的过程，先生成可解释的推理链分解指代表达，再利用这些推理来定位目标对象。

Result: 在三个精心设计的少样本地理空间指代表达基准测试中，Geo-R1模型持续且显著优于监督微调基线，并展现出强大的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: Geo-R1通过推理中心的方法有效利用了有限标注数据，增强了模型的泛化能力和可解释性，为解决少样本地理空间指代表达理解问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Referring expression understanding in remote sensing poses unique challenges,
as it requires reasoning over complex object-context relationships. While
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on multimodal large language models achieves
strong performance with massive labeled datasets, they struggle in data-scarce
scenarios, leading to poor generalization. To address this limitation, we
propose Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) paradigm
for few-shot geospatial referring. Geo-R1 enforces the model to first generate
explicit, interpretable reasoning chains that decompose referring expressions,
and then leverage these rationales to localize target objects. This "reason
first, then act" process enables the model to make more effective use of
limited annotations, enhances generalization, and provides interpretability. We
validate Geo-R1 on three carefully designed few-shot geospatial referring
benchmarks, where our model consistently and substantially outperforms SFT
baselines. It also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization,
highlighting its robustness. Code and data will be released at

TL;DR: 该研究评估了医学视觉语言模型中的临床奉承行为，提出了一个医学奉承数据集和轻量级缓解策略VIPER，通过过滤非证据内容来减少模型奉承行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在临床工作流程中应用日益广泛，但这些模型经常表现出奉承行为，优先考虑与用户措辞、社交线索或感知权威的一致性，而非基于证据的推理。

Method: 构建医学奉承数据集（基于PathVQA、SLAKE和VQA-RAD），使用心理学动机的压力模板评估各种VLMs，并提出VIPER框架过滤非证据内容并生成基于证据的答案。

Result: 发现VLMs普遍易受奉承行为影响，奉承反应发生率与模型准确性或大小相关性较弱。模仿和专家提供的修正被发现是最有效的触发因素，表明模型存在独立于视觉证据的偏见机制。

Conclusion: VIPER框架能有效减少奉承行为，同时保持可解释性。该基准分析和缓解框架为医学VLMs在真实世界临床交互中的稳健部署奠定了基础，强调了对证据锚定防御的需求。

Abstract: Vision language models(VLMs) are increasingly integrated into clinical
workflows, but they often exhibit sycophantic behavior prioritizing alignment
with user phrasing social cues or perceived authority over evidence based
reasoning. This study evaluate clinical sycophancy in medical visual question
answering through a novel clinically grounded benchmark. We propose a medical
sycophancy dataset construct from PathVQA, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD stratified by
different type organ system and modality. Using psychologically motivated
pressure templates including various sycophancy. In our adversarial experiments
on various VLMs, we found that these models are generally vulnerable,
exhibiting significant variations in the occurrence of adversarial responses,
with weak correlations to the model accuracy or size. Imitation and expert
provided corrections were found to be the most effective triggers, suggesting
that the models possess a bias mechanism independent of visual evidence. To
address this, we propose Visual Information Purification for Evidence based
Response (VIPER) a lightweight mitigation strategy that filters non evidentiary
content for example social pressures and then generates constrained evidence
first answers. This framework reduces sycophancy by an average amount
outperforming baselines while maintaining interpretability. Our benchmark
analysis and mitigation framework lay the groundwork for robust deployment of
medical VLMs in real world clinician interactions emphasizing the need for
evidence anchored defenses.

TL;DR: GLARIFY是一种利用时空注视信息增强视觉语言模型在现实应用中效果的新方法，通过处理注视数据的噪声和歧义问题，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能眼镜的普及，用户注视数据被整合到视觉语言模型中，但注视数据存在歧义挑战：用户口头问题使用代词或省略上下文变得模糊，人类注视模式噪声大且与口语问题具有复杂时空关系。现有方法仅使用单张图像作为视觉输入，无法捕捉用户注意力的动态特性。

Method: 首先分析数百个包含注视模态的查询样本，证明用户注视模式的噪声特性；然后使用GPT-4o设计自动数据合成流水线生成GLARIFY-Ambi数据集，包含处理噪声注视模式的链式思维过程；最后设计热图模块将注视信息整合到先进视觉语言模型中，同时保留预训练知识。

Result: 在保留测试集上的实验表明，GLARIFY显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过稳健地将视觉语言模型与人类注意力对齐，GLARIFY为与视觉助手建立可用且直观的交互范式铺平了道路。

Abstract: With the rise in popularity of smart glasses, users' attention has been
integrated into Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to streamline multi-modal
querying in daily scenarios. However, leveraging gaze data to model users'
attention may introduce ambiguity challenges: (1) users' verbal questions
become ambiguous by using pronouns or skipping context, (2) humans' gaze
patterns can be noisy and exhibit complex spatiotemporal relationships with
their spoken questions. Previous works only consider single image as visual
modality input, failing to capture the dynamic nature of the user's attention.
In this work, we introduce GLARIFY, a novel method to leverage spatiotemporal
gaze information to enhance the model's effectiveness in real-world
applications. Initially, we analyzed hundreds of querying samples with the gaze
modality to demonstrate the noisy nature of users' gaze patterns. We then
utilized GPT-4o to design an automatic data synthesis pipeline to generate the
GLARIFY-Ambi dataset, which includes a dedicated chain-of-thought (CoT) process
to handle noisy gaze patterns. Finally, we designed a heatmap module to
incorporate gaze information into cutting-edge VLMs while preserving their
pretrained knowledge. We evaluated GLARIFY using a hold-out test set.
Experiments demonstrate that GLARIFY significantly outperforms baselines. By
robustly aligning VLMs with human attention, GLARIFY paves the way for a usable
and intuitive interaction paradigm with a visual assistant.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了大型视觉语言模型的空间偏差问题，发现模型对图像中相同视觉信息在不同位置的响应不一致，并提出了一种平衡位置分配机制来缓解这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多模态任务中取得了显著成功，但其对空间变化的鲁棒性尚未得到充分理解。研究者希望探究当相同关键视觉信息放置在不同位置时，模型是否会产生不一致的输出。

Method: 通过精心设计的探测数据集分析LVLMs的空间偏差，发现问题的根源在于语言模型组件中位置嵌入的不平衡设计。提出了平衡位置分配机制，为所有图像token分配相同的位置嵌入。

Result: 实验表明，BaPA机制无需重新训练即可增强LVLMs的空间鲁棒性，结合轻量级微调还能进一步提升其在多样化多模态基准测试中的性能。信息流分析显示BaPA产生了更平衡的注意力分布。

Conclusion: 当前LVLMs存在显著的空间偏差问题，主要源于位置嵌入的不平衡设计。BaPA机制通过平衡位置嵌入分配，有效提升了模型的空间鲁棒性和整体视觉理解能力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success across
a wide range of multimodal tasks, yet their robustness to spatial variations
remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a systematic study
of the spatial bias of LVLMs, focusing on how models respond when identical key
visual information is placed at different locations within an image. Through a
carefully designed probing dataset, we demonstrate that current LVLMs often
produce inconsistent outputs under such spatial shifts, revealing a fundamental
limitation in their spatial-semantic understanding. Further analysis shows that
this phenomenon originates not from the vision encoder, which reliably
perceives and interprets visual content across positions, but from the
unbalanced design of position embeddings in the language model component. In
particular, the widely adopted position embedding strategies, such as RoPE,
introduce imbalance during cross-modal interaction, leading image tokens at
different positions to exert unequal influence on semantic understanding. To
mitigate this issue, we introduce Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA), a simple
yet effective mechanism that assigns identical position embeddings to all image
tokens, promoting a more balanced integration of visual information. Extensive
experiments show that BaPA enhances the spatial robustness of LVLMs without
retraining and further boosts their performance across diverse multimodal
benchmarks when combined with lightweight fine-tuning. Further analysis of
information flow reveals that BaPA yields balanced attention, enabling more
holistic visual understanding.

Motivation: 扩散模型骨干网络既编码语义特征又包含视觉特征，但缺乏标注数据集使得分离这些视觉特征具有挑战性，需要开发新方法来量化主题驱动图像生成中的视觉不一致性。

Method: 构建了基于现有主题驱动图像生成数据集的自动标注流程，设计对比架构分离视觉和语义特征，利用分离表示提出VSM指标。

Result: 该方法在量化视觉不一致性方面优于CLIP、DINO和视觉语言模型等全局特征方法，同时支持不一致区域的空间定位。

Conclusion: 这是首个同时支持主题驱动生成中不一致性量化和定位的方法，为该任务的进展提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for disentangling visual and semantic features
from the backbones of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling visual
correspondence in a manner analogous to the well-established semantic
correspondence. While diffusion model backbones are known to encode
semantically rich features, they must also contain visual features to support
their image synthesis capabilities. However, isolating these visual features is
challenging due to the absence of annotated datasets. To address this, we
introduce an automated pipeline that constructs image pairs with annotated
semantic and visual correspondences based on existing subject-driven image
generation datasets, and design a contrastive architecture to separate the two
feature types. Leveraging the disentangled representations, we propose a new
metric, Visual Semantic Matching (VSM), that quantifies visual inconsistencies
in subject-driven image generation. Empirical results show that our approach
outperforms global feature-based metrics such as CLIP, DINO, and
vision--language models in quantifying visual inconsistencies while also
enabling spatial localization of inconsistent regions. To our knowledge, this
is the first method that supports both quantification and localization of
inconsistencies in subject-driven generation, offering a valuable tool for
advancing this task. Project

Abstract: While embeddings from multimodal large language models (LLMs) excel as
general-purpose representations, their application to dynamic modalities like
audio and video remains underexplored. We introduce WAVE (\textbf{u}nified \&
\textbf{v}ersatile \textbf{a}udio-\textbf{v}isual \textbf{e}mbeddings), the
first LLM-based embedding that creates a unified representation space for text,

prompt-aware embeddings tailored to user instructions. Experimentally, WAVE
sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB-v2 video benchmark and achieves
superior results in audio and video-to-audio retrieval. Its prompt-aware nature
also yields remarkable performance in multimodal question answering,
significantly outperforming existing embedding models. Ablation studies

Result: 在多个数据集上，ERGO比原始模型和竞争方法获得更高准确率，同时效率更高。例如在V*基准测试中超越Qwen2.5-VL-7B 4.7分，仅使用23%的视觉token，实现3倍推理加速。

Conclusion: ERGO通过推理驱动的感知方法，在保持准确性的同时显著提高了视觉语言模型的效率，为高分辨率图像处理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient processing of high-resolution images is crucial for real-world
vision-language applications. However, existing Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of
vision tokens. With the advent of "thinking with images" models, reasoning now
extends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our
two-stage "coarse-to-fine" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is
analyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are
cropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This
approach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual
details where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are
truly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first
stage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where
clear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this
issue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs
reasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to
focus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped
region to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end,
we develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning
framework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach
delivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with
greater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V*
benchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a
3x inference speedup. The code and models can be found at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的学习型深度聚焦方法在复杂场景中表现不佳，特别是在细纹理或深度突变区域，焦点线索可能变得模糊或误导。

Method: 提出变分公式，包含空间约束和焦距约束：空间约束利用不同焦距级别的梯度模式变化区分真实深度边缘和纹理伪影；焦距约束强制单峰单调的焦点概率分布，符合物理焦点行为。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的综合实验表明，DualFocus在深度准确性和感知质量方面始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: DualFocus通过引入针对深度聚焦的双重约束，在具有挑战性的区域显著提高了深度估计的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Depth-from-Focus (DFF) enables precise depth estimation by analyzing focus
cues across a stack of images captured at varying focal lengths. While recent
learning-based approaches have advanced this field, they often struggle in
complex scenes with fine textures or abrupt depth changes, where focus cues may
become ambiguous or misleading. We present DualFocus, a novel DFF framework
that leverages the focal stack's unique gradient patterns induced by focus
variation, jointly modeling focus changes over spatial and focal dimensions.
Our approach introduces a variational formulation with dual constraints
tailored to DFF: spatial constraints exploit gradient pattern changes across
focus levels to distinguish true depth edges from texture artifacts, while
focal constraints enforce unimodal, monotonic focus probabilities aligned with
physical focus behavior. These inductive biases improve robustness and accuracy
in challenging regions. Comprehensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that DualFocus consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both depth accuracy and perceptual quality.

Result: 在3D目标检测和BEV分割任务上，RDcomm在DAIR-V2X和OPV2V数据集上达到最先进精度，同时将通信量降低高达108倍。

Conclusion: 本文提出的理论框架和RDcomm方法有效解决了协作感知中的性能-通信权衡问题，为多智能体系统提供了理论基础和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative perception emphasizes enhancing environmental understanding by
enabling multiple agents to share visual information with limited bandwidth
resources. While prior work has explored the empirical trade-off between task
performance and communication volume, a significant gap remains in the
theoretical foundation. To fill this gap, we draw on information theory and
introduce a pragmatic rate-distortion theory for multi-agent collaboration,
specifically formulated to analyze performance-communication trade-off in
goal-oriented multi-agent systems. This theory concretizes two key conditions
for designing optimal communication strategies: supplying pragmatically
relevant information and transmitting redundancy-less messages. Guided by these
two conditions, we propose RDcomm, a communication-efficient collaborative
perception framework that introduces two key innovations: i) task entropy
discrete coding, which assigns features with task-relevant codeword-lengths to
maximize the efficiency in supplying pragmatic information; ii)
mutual-information-driven message selection, which utilizes mutual information
neural estimation to approach the optimal redundancy-less condition.
Experiments on 3D object detection and BEV segmentation demonstrate that RDcomm
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on DAIR-V2X and OPV2V, while reducing
communication volume by up to 108 times. The code will be released.

Motivation: 静态基准测试在诊断文本到图像模型的系统性失败方面能力有限，需要一种主动探索方法来全面映射模型的失败景观。

Method: 将错误发现构建为结构化搜索问题，寻找最小化、诱发失败的概念，并采用新颖的加速技术解决计算爆炸问题。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion模型中发现超过247,000个未知错误切片，首次大规模证明这些失败与训练数据稀缺相关。

Conclusion: FailureAtlas建立了一种诊断优先的方法论，为开发更鲁棒的生成式AI提供了可扩展的深度模型审计引擎。

Abstract: Static benchmarks have provided a valuable foundation for comparing
Text-to-Image (T2I) models. However, their passive design offers limited
diagnostic power, struggling to uncover the full landscape of systematic
failures or isolate their root causes. We argue for a complementary paradigm:
active exploration. We introduce FailureAtlas, the first framework designed to
autonomously explore and map the vast failure landscape of T2I models at scale.
FailureAtlas frames error discovery as a structured search for minimal,
failure-inducing concepts. While it is a computationally explosive problem, we
make it tractable with novel acceleration techniques. When applied to Stable
Diffusion models, our method uncovers hundreds of thousands of previously
unknown error slices (over 247,000 in SD1.5 alone) and provides the first
large-scale evidence linking these failures to data scarcity in the training
set. By providing a principled and scalable engine for deep model auditing,
FailureAtlas establishes a new, diagnostic-first methodology to guide the
development of more robust generative AI. The code is available at

Method: 引入幻觉放大机制：通过文本到图像模型将描述投影到视觉空间揭示隐含幻觉信号作为负锚点，原始图像作为正锚点，利用双锚点编辑解码器隐藏状态，拉近表示与真实语义的距离，推离幻觉方向。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著减少了对象、属性和关系层面的幻觉，同时基本保持了召回率和描述丰富度，例如在CHAIR上使用LLaVA-v1.5-7B实现超过5%的幻觉减少，并在不同架构上验证了强跨架构泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法无需人工先验或额外训练成本，在幻觉自由描述上几乎没有副作用，具有鲁棒性和即插即用的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet they remain highly susceptible to
hallucinations, producing content that is fluent but inconsistent with visual
evidence. Such hallucinations, spanning objects, attributes, and relations,
persist even in larger models, while existing mitigation approaches often
require additional finetuning, handcrafted priors, or trade-offs that
compromise informativeness and scalability. To address this limitation, we
propose a training-free, self-supervised method for hallucination mitigation.
Our approach introduces a novel hallucination amplification mechanism: a
caption is projected into the visual space via a text-to-image model to reveal
implicit hallucination signals, serving as a negative anchor, while the
original image provides a positive anchor. Leveraging these dual anchors, we
edit decoder hidden states by pulling representations toward faithful semantics
and pushing them away from hallucination directions. This correction requires
no human priors or additional training costs, ensuring both effectiveness and
efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our
method significantly reduces hallucinations at the object, attribute, and
relation levels while largely preserving recall and caption richness, e.g.,
achieving a hallucination reduction by over 5% using LLaVA-v1.5-7B on CHAIR.
Furthermore, results on diverse architectures, including LLaVA-NEXT-7B,
Cambrian-8B, and InstructBLIP-7B, validate strong cross-architecture
generalization. More importantly, when applied to hallucination-free captions,
our method introduces almost no side effects, underscoring its robustness and
practical plug-and-play applicability. The implementation will be publicly
available.

TL;DR: 提出CoFFT方法，通过模拟人类视觉认知来增强视觉语言模型的推理能力，无需训练即可提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在处理复杂冗余的视觉输入时容易受到干扰，产生过多任务无关的推理过程甚至幻觉，无法在推理过程中精确发现和处理所需区域

Method: CoFFT方法包含三个迭代阶段：多样化样本生成、双重前瞻解码和视觉焦点调整，形成推理引导视觉焦点、视觉焦点指导后续推理的循环

Result: 在多个基准测试中使用Qwen2.5-VL、InternVL-2.5和Llava-Next模型，性能一致提升3.1-5.8%，计算开销可控增加

Conclusion: CoFFT方法有效解决了视觉语言模型在处理复杂视觉输入时的局限性，通过模拟人类视觉认知过程显著提升了推理性能

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs), they remain
constrained by the complexity and redundancy of visual input. When images
contain large amounts of irrelevant information, VLMs are susceptible to
interference, thus generating excessive task-irrelevant reasoning processes or
even hallucinations. This limitation stems from their inability to discover and
process the required regions during reasoning precisely. To address this
limitation, we present the Chain of Foresight-Focus Thought (CoFFT), a novel
training-free approach that enhances VLMs' visual reasoning by emulating human
visual cognition. Each Foresight-Focus Thought consists of three stages: (1)
Diverse Sample Generation: generates diverse reasoning samples to explore
potential reasoning paths, where each sample contains several reasoning steps;
(2) Dual Foresight Decoding: rigorously evaluates these samples based on both
visual focus and reasoning progression, adding the first step of optimal sample
to the reasoning process; (3) Visual Focus Adjustment: precisely adjust visual
focus toward regions most beneficial for future reasoning, before returning to
stage (1) to generate subsequent reasoning samples until reaching the final
answer. These stages function iteratively, creating an interdependent cycle
where reasoning guides visual focus and visual focus informs subsequent
reasoning. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks using Qwen2.5-VL,
InternVL-2.5, and Llava-Next demonstrate consistent performance improvements of
3.1-5.8\% with controllable increasing computational overhead.

Abstract: Healthcare robotics requires robust multimodal perception and reasoning to
ensure safety in dynamic clinical environments. Current Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) demonstrate strong general-purpose capabilities but remain limited in
temporal reasoning, uncertainty estimation, and structured outputs needed for

compared to state-of-the-art VLMs, demonstrating its potential for applications
in robot-assisted surgery, patient monitoring, and decision support.

Method: 构建了包含语音、视觉、文本等多模态信息的面对面教学数据集，并比较了多模态大语言模型与传统任务特定模型在程序步骤分割和对话状态分类任务上的性能。

Result: 实验表明，多模态大语言模型即使在没有任务特定微调的情况下，也优于专门的基线模型。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在理解面对面教学互动方面显示出潜力，能够整合处理言语和非言语信息。

Abstract: Analyzing instructional interactions between an instructor and a learner who
are co-present in the same physical space is a critical problem for educational
support and skill transfer. Yet such face-to-face instructional scenes have not
been systematically studied in computer vision. We identify two key reasons: i)
the lack of suitable datasets and ii) limited analytical techniques. To address
this gap, we present a new egocentric video dataset of face-to-face instruction
and provide ground-truth annotations for two fundamental tasks that serve as a
first step toward a comprehensive understanding of instructional interactions:
procedural step segmentation and conversation-state classification. Using this
dataset, we benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) against
conventional task-specific models. Since face-to-face instruction involves
multiple modalities (speech content and prosody, gaze and body motion, and
visual context), effective understanding requires methods that handle verbal
and nonverbal communication in an integrated manner. Accordingly, we evaluate
recently introduced MLLMs that jointly process images, audio, and text. This
evaluation quantifies the extent to which current machine learning models
understand face-to-face instructional scenes. In experiments, MLLMs outperform
specialized baselines even without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting their
promise for holistic understanding of instructional interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将声音分离视为基于掩码的回归问题，但在捕捉复杂数据分布以高质量分离不同类别声音方面存在局限。

Method: 利用去噪扩散概率模型(DDPM)和流匹配(FM)等生成建模范式，在专门的分离U-Net架构中，从噪声分布直接合成分离后的声音频谱图，同时以混合音频输入和相关视觉信息为条件。

Result: 在标准AVE和MUSIC数据集上的评估表明，DAVIS的DDPM和Flow Matching变体在分离质量上都超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: 生成式框架在解决音频-视觉源分离任务方面具有显著优势，能够产生高质量的分离结果。

Abstract: We propose DAVIS, a Diffusion-based Audio-VIsual Separation framework that
solves the audio-visual sound source separation task through generative
learning. Existing methods typically frame sound separation as a mask-based
regression problem, achieving significant progress. However, they face
limitations in capturing the complex data distribution required for
high-quality separation of sounds from diverse categories. In contrast, DAVIS
circumvents these issues by leveraging potent generative modeling paradigms,
specifically Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and the more
recent Flow Matching (FM), integrated within a specialized Separation U-Net
architecture. Our framework operates by synthesizing the desired separated
sound spectrograms directly from a noise distribution, conditioned concurrently
on the mixed audio input and associated visual information. The inherent nature
of its generative objective makes DAVIS particularly adept at producing
high-quality sound separations for diverse sound categories. We present
comparative evaluations of DAVIS, encompassing both its DDPM and Flow Matching
variants, against leading methods on the standard AVE and MUSIC datasets. The
results affirm that both variants surpass existing approaches in separation
quality, highlighting the efficacy of our generative framework for tackling the
audio-visual source separation task.

Motivation: GAN和扩散模型生成的伪造内容越来越逼真，现有方法仅关注空间或频域特征，限制了其对未知篡改的泛化能力。

Method: 使用双域特征耦合器(DDFC)分解特征为局部空间分支和全局频谱分支，结合双傅里叶注意力(DFA)模块动态融合空间和频谱特征，基于改进的XceptionNet架构。

Conclusion: 统一的空间-频谱学习对于鲁棒和可泛化的深度伪造检测非常有效。

Abstract: The increasing realism of content generated by GANs and diffusion models has
made deepfake detection significantly more challenging. Existing approaches
often focus solely on spatial or frequency-domain features, limiting their
generalization to unseen manipulations. We propose the Spectral
Cross-Attentional Network (SpecXNet), a dual-domain architecture for robust
deepfake detection. The core \textbf{Dual-Domain Feature Coupler (DDFC)}
decomposes features into a local spatial branch for capturing texture-level
anomalies and a global spectral branch that employs Fast Fourier Transform to
model periodic inconsistencies. This dual-domain formulation allows SpecXNet to
jointly exploit localized detail and global structural coherence, which are
critical for distinguishing authentic from manipulated images. We also
introduce the \textbf{Dual Fourier Attention (DFA)} module, which dynamically
fuses spatial and spectral features in a content-aware manner. Built atop a
modified XceptionNet backbone, we embed the DDFC and DFA modules within a
separable convolution block. Extensive experiments on multiple deepfake
benchmarks show that SpecXNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly
under cross-dataset and unseen manipulation scenarios, while maintaining
real-time feasibility. Our results highlight the effectiveness of unified
spatial-spectral learning for robust and generalizable deepfake detection. To
ensure reproducibility, we released the full code on

Motivation: 现有3D重建模型无法生成资产的材质属性，这在多样化光照环境中对真实感渲染至关重要。

Conclusion: MGM框架成功生成了带有PBR材质的高质量3D内容，支持动态重光照，为实际渲染应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The increasing demand for 3D assets across various industries necessitates
efficient and automated methods for 3D content creation. Leveraging 3D Gaussian
Splatting, recent large reconstruction models (LRMs) have demonstrated the
ability to efficiently achieve high-quality 3D rendering by integrating
multiview diffusion for generation and scalable transformers for
reconstruction. However, existing models fail to produce the material
properties of assets, which is crucial for realistic rendering in diverse
lighting environments. In this paper, we introduce the Large Material Gaussian
Model (MGM), a novel framework designed to generate high-quality 3D content
with Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials, ie, albedo, roughness, and
metallic properties, rather than merely producing RGB textures with
uncontrolled light baking. Specifically, we first fine-tune a new multiview
material diffusion model conditioned on input depth and normal maps. Utilizing
the generated multiview PBR images, we explore a Gaussian material
representation that not only aligns with 2D Gaussian Splatting but also models
each channel of the PBR materials. The reconstructed point clouds can then be
rendered to acquire PBR attributes, enabling dynamic relighting by applying
various ambient light maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
materials produced by our method not only exhibit greater visual appeal
compared to baseline methods but also enhance material modeling, thereby
enabling practical downstream rendering applications.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 提出的自监督点云补全方法克服了现有方法的局限性，通过多视图增强和Mamba架构实现了更好的补全效果

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to reconstruct complete shapes from partial
observations. Although current methods have achieved remarkable performance,
they still have some limitations: Supervised methods heavily rely on ground
truth, which limits their generalization to real-world datasets due to the
synthetic-to-real domain gap. Unsupervised methods require complete point
clouds to compose unpaired training data, and weakly-supervised methods need
multi-view observations of the object. Existing self-supervised methods
frequently produce unsatisfactory predictions due to the limited capabilities
of their self-supervised signals. To overcome these challenges, we propose a
novel self-supervised point cloud completion method. We design a set of novel
self-supervised signals based on multi-view augmentations of the single partial
point cloud. Additionally, to enhance the model's learning ability, we first
incorporate Mamba into self-supervised point cloud completion task, encouraging
the model to generate point clouds with better quality. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Conditional image generation models have achieved remarkable results by
leveraging text-based control to generate customized images. However, the high
resource demands of these models and the scarcity of well-annotated data have
hindered their deployment on edge devices, leading to enormous costs and
privacy concerns, especially when user data is sent to a third party. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Refine-Control, a semi-supervised
distillation framework. Specifically, we improve the performance of the student
model by introducing a tri-level knowledge fusion loss to transfer different
levels of knowledge. To enhance generalization and alleviate dataset scarcity,
we introduce a semi-supervised distillation method utilizing both labeled and
unlabeled data. Our experiments reveal that Refine-Control achieves significant
reductions in computational cost and latency, while maintaining high-fidelity
generation capabilities and controllability, as quantified by comparative
metrics.

Abstract: Material node graphs are programs that generate the 2D channels of procedural
materials, including geometry such as roughness and displacement maps, and
reflectance such as albedo and conductivity maps. They are essential in
computer graphics for representing the appearance of virtual 3D objects
parametrically and at arbitrary resolution. In particular, their directed
acyclic graph structures and intermediate states provide an intuitive
understanding and workflow for interactive appearance modeling. Creating such
graphs is a challenging task and typically requires professional training.
While recent neural program synthesis approaches attempt to simplify this
process, they solely represent graphs as textual programs, failing to capture
the inherently visual-spatial nature of node graphs that makes them accessible
to humans. To address this gap, we present MultiMat, a multimodal program
synthesis framework that leverages large multimodal models to process both
visual and textual graph representations for improved generation of procedural
material graphs. We train our models on a new dataset of production-quality
procedural materials and combine them with a constrained tree search inference
algorithm that ensures syntactic validity while efficiently navigating the
program space. Our experimental results show that our multimodal program
synthesis method is more efficient in both unconditional and conditional graph
synthesis with higher visual quality and fidelity than text-only baselines,
establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Result: PCA集成显著减少了总优化时间，同时保持了良好的视觉质量，在浅层潜在空间（W+层=3）中甚至提升了SSIM指标，并成功实现了AFHQ-Dog和AFHQ-Cat模型的图像对齐和可控操作。

Conclusion: 该方法为广泛的图像合成和编辑应用提供了高效且可解释的潜在空间控制可能性。

Abstract: This work integrates StyleGAN, DragGAN and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
to enhance the latent space efficiency and controllability of GAN-generated
images. Style-GAN provides a structured latent space, DragGAN enables intuitive
image manipulation, and PCA reduces dimensionality and facilitates cross-model
alignment for more streamlined and interpretable exploration of latent spaces.
We apply our techniques to the Animal Faces High Quality (AFHQ) dataset, and
find that our approach of integrating PCA-based dimensionality reduction with
the Drag-GAN framework for image manipulation retains performance while
improving optimization efficiency. Notably, introducing PCA into the latent W+
layers of DragGAN can consistently reduce the total optimization time while
maintaining good visual quality and even boosting the Structural Similarity
Index Measure (SSIM) of the optimized image, particularly in shallower latent
spaces (W+ layers = 3). We also demonstrate capability for aligning images
generated by two StyleGAN models trained on similar but distinct data domains
(AFHQ-Dog and AFHQ-Cat), and show that we can control the latent space of these
aligned images to manipulate the images in an intuitive and interpretable
manner. Our findings highlight the possibility for efficient and interpretable
latent space control for a wide range of image synthesis and editing
applications.

Abstract: We introduce MinerU2.5, a 1.2B-parameter document parsing vision-language
model that achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy while maintaining
exceptional computational efficiency. Our approach employs a coarse-to-fine,
two-stage parsing strategy that decouples global layout analysis from local
content recognition. In the first stage, the model performs efficient layout
analysis on downsampled images to identify structural elements, circumventing
the computational overhead of processing high-resolution inputs. In the second
stage, guided by the global layout, it performs targeted content recognition on
native-resolution crops extracted from the original image, preserving
fine-grained details in dense text, complex formulas, and tables. To support
this strategy, we developed a comprehensive data engine that generates diverse,
large-scale training corpora for both pretraining and fine-tuning. Ultimately,
MinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing both
general-purpose and domain-specific models across various recognition tasks,
while maintaining significantly lower computational overhead.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing often fail at complex
analytical tasks, a limitation stemming from their end-to-end training paradigm
that bypasses crucial reasoning steps and leads to unverifiable outputs. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Perceptually-Grounded Geospatial

a verifiable, multi-step process. We instill this analytical process through a
two-stage alignment strategy, leveraging Geo-CoT380k, the first large-scale

supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill the foundational cognitive
architecture, then leverages Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine
the model's reasoning policy towards factual correctness. The resulting model,
RSThinker, outputs both a final answer and its justifying, verifiable
analytical trace. This capability yields dominant performance, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art models across a comprehensive range of tasks.
The public release of our Geo-CoT380k dataset and RSThinker model upon

### [108] [Polysemous Language Gaussian Splatting via Matching-based Mask Lifting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22225)
*Jiayu Ding,Xinpeng Liu,Zhiyi Pan,Shiqiang Long,Ge Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUSplat是一个无需训练的开源框架，将2D开放词汇理解提升到3D高斯泼溅场景，解决了现有方法依赖逐场景训练、单语义限制和跨视图语义不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主流方法存在三个关键缺陷：(i)依赖昂贵的逐场景重新训练，无法即插即用；(ii)限制性的单语义设计无法表示复杂多概念语义；(iii)易受跨视图语义不一致影响，破坏最终语义表示。

Method: 利用预训练的2D分割模型生成多粒度2D掩码并提升到3D，为每个高斯点估计前景概率形成初始对象组，然后使用语义熵和几何不透明度优化模糊边界，最后通过视觉语言模型从最具代表性视角解释对象外观，提取鲁棒文本特征。

Result: MUSplat将场景适应时间从数小时减少到几分钟，在开放词汇3D对象选择和语义分割基准任务中，表现优于已建立的基于训练的框架，同时解决了它们的单语义限制。

Conclusion: 通过完全放弃特征优化，MUSplat提供了一个训练免费的框架，能够有效处理3DGS场景中的开放词汇理解，实现了更高的效率和更好的性能。

Abstract: Lifting 2D open-vocabulary understanding into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
scenes is a critical challenge. However, mainstream methods suffer from three
key flaws: (i) their reliance on costly per-scene retraining prevents
plug-and-play application; (ii) their restrictive monosemous design fails to
represent complex, multi-concept semantics; and (iii) their vulnerability to
cross-view semantic inconsistencies corrupts the final semantic representation.
To overcome these limitations, we introduce MUSplat, a training-free framework
that abandons feature optimization entirely. Leveraging a pre-trained 2D
segmentation model, our pipeline generates and lifts multi-granularity 2D masks
into 3D, where we estimate a foreground probability for each Gaussian point to
form initial object groups. We then optimize the ambiguous boundaries of these
initial groups using semantic entropy and geometric opacity. Subsequently, by
interpreting the object's appearance across its most representative viewpoints,
a Vision-Language Model (VLM) distills robust textual features that reconciles
visual inconsistencies, enabling open-vocabulary querying via semantic
matching. By eliminating the costly per-scene training process, MUSplat reduces
scene adaptation time from hours to mere minutes. On benchmark tasks for
open-vocabulary 3D object selection and semantic segmentation, MUSplat
outperforms established training-based frameworks while simultaneously
addressing their monosemous limitations.

*Jun He,Yi Lin,Zilong Huang,Jiacong Yin,Junyan Ye,Yuchuan Zhou,Weijia Li,Xiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanFeel是一个评估多模态大语言模型在城市发展理解和主观环境感知方面性能的综合基准，包含14.3K个视觉问题，涵盖静态场景感知、时间变化理解和主观环境感知三个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市发展影响着全球一半以上人口，需要从人类中心视角理解其结构和感知变化，而现有基准在探索MLLMs在城市环境中的表现方面存在局限，缺乏对时间演化和主观感知的系统性探索。

Method: 收集全球11个代表性城市的多时相单视角和全景街景图像，通过空间聚类、规则生成、模型辅助提示和人工标注的混合流程生成高质量问答对。

Result: 评估20个最先进MLLMs发现，Gemini-2.5 Pro表现最佳，准确率接近人类专家水平，平均差距仅为1.5%。多数模型在场景理解任务中表现良好，部分模型在像素级变化检测中甚至超越人类标注者，但在需要时间推理的任务中性能显著下降。

Conclusion: MLLMs在城市环境理解方面展现出强大潜力，特别是在静态场景感知和某些主观维度评估上达到或超越人类水平，但在时间推理方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Urban development impacts over half of the global population, making
human-centered understanding of its structural and perceptual changes essential
for sustainable development. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, existing benchmarks
that explore their performance in urban environments remain limited, lacking
systematic exploration of temporal evolution and subjective perception of urban
environment that aligns with human perception. To address these limitations, we
propose UrbanFeel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
performance of MLLMs in urban development understanding and subjective
environmental perception. UrbanFeel comprises 14.3K carefully constructed
visual questions spanning three cognitively progressive dimensions: Static
Scene Perception, Temporal Change Understanding, and Subjective Environmental
Perception. We collect multi-temporal single-view and panoramic street-view
images from 11 representative cities worldwide, and generate high-quality
question-answer pairs through a hybrid pipeline of spatial clustering,
rule-based generation, model-assisted prompting, and manual annotation. Through
extensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5
Pro achieves the best overall performance, with its accuracy approaching human
expert levels and narrowing the average gap to just 1.5\%. Most models perform
well on tasks grounded in scene understanding. In particular, some models even
surpass human annotators in pixel-level change detection. However, performance
drops notably in tasks requiring temporal reasoning over urban development.
Additionally, in the subjective perception dimension, several models reach
human-level or even higher consistency in evaluating dimension such as
beautiful and safety.

*Jiaping Yu,Muli Yang,Jiapeng Ji,Jiexi Yan,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出EXCL方法解决无源无监督域自适应问题，通过双专家框架和检索增强交互优化管道，在无需源数据的情况下实现目标域适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFUDA方法要么仅利用源模型预测，要么微调大型多模态模型，但都忽略了互补见解和目标数据的潜在结构。

Method: EXCL包含双专家框架（冻结源域模型+预训练视觉语言模型）和检索增强交互优化管道（三阶段：协同检索样本、分别微调专家、强制学习一致性）。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EXCL方法通过双专家协作学习，在无源无监督域自适应任务中取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) addresses the realistic
challenge of adapting a source-trained model to a target domain without access
to the source data, driven by concerns over privacy and cost. Existing SFUDA
methods either exploit only the source model's predictions or fine-tune large
multimodal models, yet both neglect complementary insights and the latent
structure of target data. In this paper, we propose the Experts Cooperative
Learning (EXCL). EXCL contains the Dual Experts framework and
Retrieval-Augmentation-Interaction optimization pipeline. The Dual Experts
framework places a frozen source-domain model (augmented with Conv-Adapter) and
a pretrained vision-language model (with a trainable text prompt) on equal
footing to mine consensus knowledge from unlabeled target samples. To
effectively train these plug-in modules under purely unsupervised conditions,
we introduce Retrieval-Augmented-Interaction(RAIN), a three-stage pipeline that
(1) collaboratively retrieves pseudo-source and complex target samples, (2)
separately fine-tunes each expert on its respective sample set, and (3)
enforces learning object consistency via a shared learning result. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach matches
state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: FlashEdit是一个实时图像编辑框架，通过一步式反转编辑、背景保护和稀疏空间交叉注意力机制，在保持高质量的同时实现150倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扩散模型的文本引导图像编辑虽然质量出色，但延迟过高阻碍了实际应用，需要开发实时高效的编辑方法。

Method: 采用三步创新：1）一步式反转编辑管道避免迭代过程；2）背景保护技术选择性修改编辑区域特征；3）稀疏空间交叉注意力机制防止语义泄漏。

Result: FlashEdit在保持背景一致性和结构完整性的同时，编辑时间低于0.2秒，相比之前多步方法加速超过150倍。

Conclusion: FlashEdit实现了高质量实时图像编辑，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing with diffusion models has achieved remarkable
quality but suffers from prohibitive latency, hindering real-world
applications. We introduce FlashEdit, a novel framework designed to enable
high-fidelity, real-time image editing. Its efficiency stems from three key
innovations: (1) a One-Step Inversion-and-Editing (OSIE) pipeline that bypasses
costly iterative processes; (2) a Background Shield (BG-Shield) technique that
guarantees background preservation by selectively modifying features only
within the edit region; and (3) a Sparsified Spatial Cross-Attention (SSCA)
mechanism that ensures precise, localized edits by suppressing semantic leakage
to the background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlashEdit maintains
superior background consistency and structural integrity, while performing
edits in under 0.2 seconds, which is an over 150$\times$ speedup compared to
prior multi-step methods. Our code will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/JunyiWuCode/FlashEdit.

TL;DR: 提出了Neural-MedBench基准测试，专门用于评估神经学领域的多模态临床推理能力，发现现有视觉语言模型在临床推理方面存在显著缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学基准测试过于关注分类准确性，导致模型看似表现良好但实际缺乏高风险的诊断推理能力，需要更深入评估临床推理能力。

Method: 构建包含多序列MRI扫描、结构化电子健康记录和临床笔记的紧凑基准测试，涵盖鉴别诊断、病变识别和原理生成三个核心任务家族，采用混合评分管道进行评估。

Result: 对GPT-4o、Claude-4和MedGemma等先进VLM进行系统评估，发现相比传统数据集性能显著下降，错误分析显示推理失败而非感知错误是主要问题。

Conclusion: 提出了双轴评估框架：广度导向的大数据集用于统计泛化，深度导向的紧凑基准测试用于推理保真度，Neural-MedBench可作为开放可扩展的诊断测试平台。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance on standard medical benchmarks, yet their true clinical reasoning
ability remains unclear. Existing datasets predominantly emphasize
classification accuracy, creating an evaluation illusion in which models appear
proficient while still failing at high-stakes diagnostic reasoning. We
introduce Neural-MedBench, a compact yet reasoning-intensive benchmark
specifically designed to probe the limits of multimodal clinical reasoning in
neurology. Neural-MedBench integrates multi-sequence MRI scans, structured
electronic health records, and clinical notes, and encompasses three core task
families: differential diagnosis, lesion recognition, and rationale generation.
To ensure reliable evaluation, we develop a hybrid scoring pipeline that
combines LLM-based graders, clinician validation, and semantic similarity
metrics. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs, including
GPT-4o, Claude-4, and MedGemma, we observe a sharp performance drop compared to
conventional datasets. Error analysis shows that reasoning failures, rather
than perceptual errors, dominate model shortcomings. Our findings highlight the
necessity of a Two-Axis Evaluation Framework: breadth-oriented large datasets
for statistical generalization, and depth-oriented, compact benchmarks such as
Neural-MedBench for reasoning fidelity. We release Neural-MedBench at
https://neuromedbench.github.io/ as an open and extensible diagnostic testbed,
which guides the expansion of future benchmarks and enables rigorous yet
cost-effective assessment of clinically trustworthy AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大规模地图构建方法依赖昂贵的专用数据采集车辆和劳动密集型标注过程，而现有卫星方法存在数据遮挡、过时等固有缺陷，以及感知方法向量化效率低导致道路不连续粗糙的问题。

Method: 提出三种创新：(1) 将车道线表示为离散序列，采用迭代策略生成更完整平滑的地图向量；(2) 支持BEV、PV和文本提示的多模态输入架构；(3) 开发状态更新策略确保大规模地图的全局连续性和一致性。

Conclusion: UniMapGen通过生成式框架有效解决了大规模地图构建中的关键挑战，为自动驾驶和导航系统提供了更高效的地图构建方案。

Abstract: Large-scale map construction is foundational for critical applications such
as autonomous driving and navigation systems. Traditional large-scale map
construction approaches mainly rely on costly and inefficient special data
collection vehicles and labor-intensive annotation processes. While existing
satellite-based methods have demonstrated promising potential in enhancing the
efficiency and coverage of map construction, they exhibit two major
limitations: (1) inherent drawbacks of satellite data (e.g., occlusions,
outdatedness) and (2) inefficient vectorization from perception-based methods,
resulting in discontinuous and rough roads that require extensive
post-processing. This paper presents a novel generative framework, UniMapGen,
for large-scale map construction, offering three key innovations: (1)
representing lane lines as \textbf{discrete sequence} and establishing an
iterative strategy to generate more complete and smooth map vectors than
traditional perception-based methods. (2) proposing a flexible architecture
that supports \textbf{multi-modal} inputs, enabling dynamic selection among
BEV, PV, and text prompt, to overcome the drawbacks of satellite data. (3)
developing a \textbf{state update} strategy for global continuity and
consistency of the constructed large-scale map. UniMapGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the OpenSatMap dataset. Furthermore, UniMapGen
can infer occluded roads and predict roads missing from dataset annotations.
Our code will be released.

TL;DR: GS-2M是一个基于3D高斯溅射的统一框架，从多视角图像中联合重建网格和分解材质，特别擅长处理高反射表面，无需依赖外部模型先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法分别处理网格重建和材质分解任务，难以重建高反射表面，且常依赖外部模型先验来增强分解结果。需要一种联合优化方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 基于3D高斯溅射，联合优化与渲染深度和法线质量相关的属性，提出基于多视角光度变化的新型粗糙度监督策略，结合精心设计的损失函数和优化过程。

Result: 重建结果与最先进方法相当，能够生成三角形网格及其关联的材质组件，适用于下游任务。在广泛使用的数据集上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: GS-2M提供了一个统一的解决方案，能够同时处理网格重建和材质分解，对高反射表面具有鲁棒性，且无需复杂的神经组件，具有良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: We propose a unified solution for mesh reconstruction and material
decomposition from multi-view images based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, referred
to as GS-2M. Previous works handle these tasks separately and struggle to
reconstruct highly reflective surfaces, often relying on priors from external
models to enhance the decomposition results. Conversely, our method addresses
these two problems by jointly optimizing attributes relevant to the quality of
rendered depth and normals, maintaining geometric details while being resilient
to reflective surfaces. Although contemporary works effectively solve these
tasks together, they often employ sophisticated neural components to learn
scene properties, which hinders their performance at scale. To further
eliminate these neural components, we propose a novel roughness supervision
strategy based on multi-view photometric variation. When combined with a
carefully designed loss and optimization process, our unified framework
produces reconstruction results comparable to state-of-the-art methods,
delivering triangle meshes and their associated material components for
downstream tasks. We validate the effectiveness of our approach with widely
used datasets from previous works and qualitative comparisons with
state-of-the-art surface reconstruction methods.

Motivation: 传统方法创建桌面场景依赖耗时的手动布局设计或纯随机布局，在合理性和任务对齐方面存在局限，需要更智能的场景生成方法。

Method: 提出空间推理链将生成过程分解为物体推断、空间关系推理和场景图构建，并基于LLM开发MesaTask框架，使用DPO算法优化生成质量。

Result: 实验表明MesaTask在生成符合任务描述的桌面场景方面优于基线方法，能够产生具有现实布局的场景。

Conclusion: MesaTask框架能够有效解决任务导向桌面场景生成问题，生成物理合理且与任务描述对齐的3D布局。

Abstract: The ability of robots to interpret human instructions and execute
manipulation tasks necessitates the availability of task-relevant tabletop
scenes for training. However, traditional methods for creating these scenes
rely on time-consuming manual layout design or purely randomized layouts, which
are limited in terms of plausibility or alignment with the tasks. In this
paper, we formulate a novel task, namely task-oriented tabletop scene
generation, which poses significant challenges due to the substantial gap
between high-level task instructions and the tabletop scenes. To support
research on such a challenging task, we introduce MesaTask-10K, a large-scale
dataset comprising approximately 10,700 synthetic tabletop scenes with manually
crafted layouts that ensure realistic layouts and intricate inter-object
relations. To bridge the gap between tasks and scenes, we propose a Spatial
Reasoning Chain that decomposes the generation process into object inference,
spatial interrelation reasoning, and scene graph construction for the final 3D
layout. We present MesaTask, an LLM-based framework that utilizes this
reasoning chain and is further enhanced with DPO algorithms to generate
physically plausible tabletop scenes that align well with given task
descriptions. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
MesaTask compared to baselines in generating task-conforming tabletop scenes
with realistic layouts. Project page is at https://mesatask.github.io/

Motivation: 虽然基于规则的强化学习在DeepSeek-R1中取得了成功，但在文档分析领域应用较少。许多下游任务可能受益于强化学习的新兴特性，特别是增强的推理能力。

Method: 使用基于规则的强化学习方法，在文档图像分类任务上进行实验，考察三种不同的分布外场景：分布外图像、未见过的类别和不同模态。

Result: 研究发现强化学习在分布外数据上表现出更好的泛化能力，在三种测试场景中都取得了良好的效果。

Conclusion: 基于规则的强化学习在文档分析任务中具有潜力，特别是在处理分布外数据时表现出优越的泛化性能。

Abstract: Rule-based reinforcement learning has been gaining popularity ever since
DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated its success through simple verifiable rewards. In
the domain of document analysis, reinforcement learning is not as prevalent,
even though many downstream tasks may benefit from the emerging properties of
reinforcement learning, particularly the enhanced reason capabilities. We study
the effects of rule-based reinforcement learning with the task of Document
Image Classification which is one of the most commonly studied downstream tasks
in document analysis. We find that reinforcement learning tends to have better
generalisation capabilities to out-of-distritbution data, which we examine in
three different scenarios, namely out-of-distribution images, unseen classes
and different modalities. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneSplit是一种针对文本到视频模型的黑盒越狱方法，通过将有害叙述分割成多个看似无害的场景，利用场景组合约束生成空间，从而绕过安全机制生成有害视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本到视频模型的快速发展，其安全风险日益凸显。虽然已有研究探索了LLM、VLM和文本到图像模型的漏洞，但文本到视频模型的安全问题尚未得到充分研究，存在显著的安全缺口。

Method: 提出SceneSplit方法：1）将有害叙述分割成多个单独无害的场景；2）利用场景组合约束生成空间，引导模型产生有害输出；3）通过迭代场景操作绕过安全过滤器；4）使用策略库重用成功攻击模式提高效果。

Result: 在11个安全类别上对T2V模型进行评估，SceneSplit在Luma Ray2上达到77.2%的平均攻击成功率，在Hailuo上达到84.1%，在Veo2上达到78.2%，显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 当前T2V安全机制容易受到利用叙事结构的攻击，这项工作为理解和改进T2V模型安全性提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Along with the rapid advancement of numerous Text-to-Video (T2V) models,
growing concerns have emerged regarding their safety risks. While recent
studies have explored vulnerabilities in models like LLMs, VLMs, and
Text-to-Image (T2I) models through jailbreak attacks, T2V models remain largely
unexplored, leaving a significant safety gap. To address this gap, we introduce
SceneSplit, a novel black-box jailbreak method that works by fragmenting a
harmful narrative into multiple scenes, each individually benign. This approach
manipulates the generative output space, the abstract set of all potential
video outputs for a given prompt, using the combination of scenes as a powerful
constraint to guide the final outcome. While each scene individually
corresponds to a wide and safe space where most outcomes are benign, their
sequential combination collectively restricts this space, narrowing it to an
unsafe region and significantly increasing the likelihood of generating a
harmful video. This core mechanism is further enhanced through iterative scene
manipulation, which bypasses the safety filter within this constrained unsafe
region. Additionally, a strategy library that reuses successful attack patterns
further improves the attack's overall effectiveness and robustness. To validate
our method, we evaluate SceneSplit across 11 safety categories on T2V models.
Our results show that it achieves a high average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of
77.2% on Luma Ray2, 84.1% on Hailuo, and 78.2% on Veo2, significantly
outperforming the existing baseline. Through this work, we demonstrate that
current T2V safety mechanisms are vulnerable to attacks that exploit narrative
structure, providing new insights for understanding and improving the safety of
T2V models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于动量的采样技术HiGS，通过整合历史预测来提升扩散模型采样质量和效率，无需额外训练即可实现更高质量的图像生成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面取得了显著进展，但其输出在较少神经函数评估次数或较低引导尺度下仍可能显得不真实且缺乏细节

Method: HiGS利用当前预测与过去预测加权平均之间的差异来引导采样过程，无需额外计算即可集成到现有扩散框架中

Result: HiGS在多样化模型和架构下均能提升图像质量，使用预训练SiT模型在ImageNet 256×256上仅用30步采样就达到了1.61的FID新记录

Conclusion: HiGS是一种即插即用的标准扩散采样增强方法，能够实现更快的生成速度和更高的保真度

Abstract: While diffusion models have made remarkable progress in image generation,
their outputs can still appear unrealistic and lack fine details, especially
when using fewer number of neural function evaluations (NFEs) or lower guidance
scales. To address this issue, we propose a novel momentum-based sampling
technique, termed history-guided sampling (HiGS), which enhances quality and
efficiency of diffusion sampling by integrating recent model predictions into
each inference step. Specifically, HiGS leverages the difference between the
current prediction and a weighted average of past predictions to steer the
sampling process toward more realistic outputs with better details and
structure. Our approach introduces practically no additional computation and
integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion frameworks, requiring neither
extra training nor fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that HiGS
consistently improves image quality across diverse models and architectures and
under varying sampling budgets and guidance scales. Moreover, using a
pretrained SiT model, HiGS achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.61 for
unguided ImageNet generation at 256$\times$256 with only 30 sampling steps
(instead of the standard 250). We thus present HiGS as a plug-and-play
enhancement to standard diffusion sampling that enables faster generation with
higher fidelity.

TL;DR: VeloxSeg提出了一种轻量级3D医学图像分割方法，通过双流CNN-Transformer架构、配对窗口注意力和Johnson-Lindenstrauss引理指导的卷积，解决了效率与鲁棒性冲突问题，在保持低计算预算的同时显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轻量级3D医学图像分割面临效率与鲁棒性的根本冲突，特别是在处理复杂解剖结构和异质模态时。本文旨在基于高维3D图像特性重新设计框架，探索数据协同以克服轻量级方法的脆弱表示。

Method: 采用可部署和可扩展的双流CNN-Transformer架构，包含配对窗口注意力(PWA)和Johnson-Lindenstrauss引理指导的卷积(JLC)。通过"一瞥-聚焦"原则，PWA快速检索多尺度信息，JLC确保鲁棒的局部特征提取。还引入了模态交互和多尺度图像检索，以及通过Gram矩阵的空间解耦知识迁移(SDKT)。

Result: 在多模态基准测试中，VeloxSeg实现了26%的Dice系数提升，同时GPU吞吐量提高了11倍，CPU提高了48倍。

Conclusion: VeloxSeg通过创新的双流架构和知识迁移策略，成功解决了轻量级3D医学图像分割的效率与鲁棒性冲突，在保持高效计算的同时显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Lightweight 3D medical image segmentation remains constrained by a
fundamental "efficiency / robustness conflict", particularly when processing
complex anatomical structures and heterogeneous modalities. In this paper, we
study how to redesign the framework based on the characteristics of
high-dimensional 3D images, and explore data synergy to overcome the fragile
representation of lightweight methods. Our approach, VeloxSeg, begins with a
deployable and extensible dual-stream CNN-Transformer architecture composed of
Paired Window Attention (PWA) and Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-guided
convolution (JLC). For each 3D image, we invoke a "glance-and-focus" principle,
where PWA rapidly retrieves multi-scale information, and JLC ensures robust
local feature extraction with minimal parameters, significantly enhancing the
model's ability to operate with low computational budget. Followed by an
extension of the dual-stream architecture that incorporates modal interaction
into the multi-scale image-retrieval process, VeloxSeg efficiently models
heterogeneous modalities. Finally, Spatially Decoupled Knowledge Transfer
(SDKT) via Gram matrices injects the texture prior extracted by a
self-supervised network into the segmentation network, yielding stronger
representations than baselines at no extra inference cost. Experimental results
on multimodal benchmarks show that VeloxSeg achieves a 26% Dice improvement,
alongside increasing GPU throughput by 11x and CPU by 48x. Codes are available

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of exemplar-based texture synthesis. We
introduce NIFTY, a hybrid framework that combines recent insights on diffusion
models trained with convolutional neural networks, and classical patch-based

TL;DR: RAPID3是一个零更新扩散变换器加速框架，通过三个轻量级策略头实现每图像自适应加速，采样速度提升近3倍且保持生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散变换器加速方法要么使用统一启发式策略牺牲质量，要么需要高成本微调，需要一种无需更新基础生成器的自适应加速方案

Method: 使用三个策略头（步跳过、缓存重用、稀疏注意力）独立决策加速策略，通过组相对策略优化在线训练，配合对抗性判别器增强奖励信号

Result: 在Stable Diffusion 3和FLUX等先进DiT骨干上实现近3倍采样加速，同时保持竞争力的生成质量

Conclusion: RAPID3证明了无需更新基础生成器即可实现高效自适应加速的可行性，为扩散模型加速提供了新思路

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) excel at visual generation yet remain hampered
by slow sampling. Existing training-free accelerators - step reduction, feature
caching, and sparse attention - enhance inference speed but typically rely on a
uniform heuristic or a manually designed adaptive strategy for all images,
leaving quality on the table. Alternatively, dynamic neural networks offer
per-image adaptive acceleration, but their high fine-tuning costs limit broader
applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce RAPID3: Tri-Level
Reinforced Acceleration Policies for Diffusion Transformers, a framework that
delivers image-wise acceleration with zero updates to the base generator.
Specifically, three lightweight policy heads - Step-Skip, Cache-Reuse, and
Sparse-Attention - observe the current denoising state and independently decide
their corresponding speed-up at each timestep. All policy parameters are
trained online via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) while the
generator remains frozen. Meanwhile, an adversarially learned discriminator
augments the reward signal, discouraging reward hacking by boosting returns
only when generated samples stay close to the original model's distribution.
Across state-of-the-art DiT backbones, including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX,
RAPID3 achieves nearly 3x faster sampling with competitive generation quality.

Abstract: Current Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) algorithms typically focus on
mapping visual features to semantic labels or attempt to enhance learning by
fusing visual and attribute information. However, these methods fail to fully
exploit attribute knowledge and contextual information for more accurate
recognition. Although recent works have started to consider using attribute
text as additional input to enhance the association between visual and semantic
information, these methods are still in their infancy. To address the above
challenges, this paper proposes the construction of a multi-modal knowledge
graph, which is utilized to mine the relationships between local visual
features and text, as well as the relationships between attributes and
extensive visual context samples. Specifically, we propose an effective
multi-modal knowledge graph construction method that fully considers the
relationships among attributes and the relationships between attributes and
vision tokens. To effectively model these relationships, this paper introduces
a knowledge graph-guided cross-modal hypergraph learning framework to enhance
the standard pedestrian attribute recognition framework. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple PAR benchmark datasets have thoroughly demonstrated the
effectiveness of our proposed knowledge graph for the PAR task, establishing a
strong foundation for knowledge-guided pedestrian attribute recognition. The

Method: 开发了层次化合成生成流程，包括基于网格的原理图生成器和自动推导符号方程标签的框图生成器，构建了包含感知、分析和设计三个工程工作流程的评估基准。

Result: 评估6个最先进的多模态大语言模型发现，闭源模型在感知任务上准确率超过85%，但在符号推导和分析推理任务上低于19%，揭示了视觉解析与符号推理之间的关键差距。

Conclusion: 具有更强符号推理能力的模型在设计任务上表现更好，确认了数学理解在电路综合中的基础作用，并将符号推理确立为工程能力的关键指标。

Abstract: Engineering design operates through hierarchical abstraction from system
specifications to component implementations, requiring visual understanding
coupled with mathematical reasoning at each level. While Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) excel at natural image tasks, their ability to extract
mathematical models from technical diagrams remains unexplored. We present
\textbf{CircuitSense}, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating circuit
understanding across this hierarchy through 8,006+ problems spanning
component-level schematics to system-level block diagrams. Our benchmark
uniquely examines the complete engineering workflow: Perception, Analysis, and
Design, with a particular emphasis on the critical but underexplored capability
of deriving symbolic equations from visual inputs. We introduce a hierarchical
synthetic generation pipeline consisting of a grid-based schematic generator
and a block diagram generator with auto-derived symbolic equation labels.
Comprehensive evaluation of six state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
closed-source and open-source models, reveals fundamental limitations in
visual-to-mathematical reasoning. Closed-source models achieve over 85\%
accuracy on perception tasks involving component recognition and topology
identification, yet their performance on symbolic derivation and analytical
reasoning falls below 19\%, exposing a critical gap between visual parsing and
symbolic reasoning. Models with stronger symbolic reasoning capabilities
consistently achieve higher design task accuracy, confirming the fundamental
role of mathematical understanding in circuit synthesis and establishing
symbolic reasoning as the key metric for engineering competence.

Abstract: The real-time detection of small objects in complex scenes, such as the
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography captured by drones, has dual
challenges of detecting small targets (<32 pixels) and maintaining real-time
efficiency on resource-constrained platforms. While YOLO-series detectors have
achieved remarkable success in real-time large object detection, they suffer
from significantly higher false negative rates for drone-based detection where
small objects dominate, compared to large object scenarios. This paper proposes
HierLight-YOLO, a hierarchical feature fusion and lightweight model that
enhances the real-time detection of small objects, based on the YOLOv8
architecture. We propose the Hierarchical Extended Path Aggregation Network
(HEPAN), a multi-scale feature fusion method through hierarchical cross-level
connections, enhancing the small object detection accuracy. HierLight-YOLO
includes two innovative lightweight modules: Inverted Residual Depthwise
Convolution Block (IRDCB) and Lightweight Downsample (LDown) module, which
significantly reduce the model's parameters and computational complexity
without sacrificing detection capabilities. Small object detection head is
designed to further enhance spatial resolution and feature fusion to tackle the
tiny object (4 pixels) detection. Comparison experiments and ablation studies
on the VisDrone2019 benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of
HierLight-YOLO.

Motivation: 遮挡是当前视觉模型在解释复杂密集真实世界图像时面临的主要挑战，需要准确预测物体间的遮挡顺序关系。

Method: 通过向预训练的GPT-4模型提供专门设计的提示词和输入图像，让模型分析图像并生成顺序预测，然后解析响应构建遮挡矩阵。

Conclusion: 该方法能以零样本方式推理遮挡关系，无需标注训练数据，可轻松集成到遮挡处理框架中。

Abstract: Occlusion remains a significant challenge for current vision models to
robustly interpret complex and dense real-world images and scenes. To address
this limitation and to enable accurate prediction of the occlusion order
relationship between objects, we propose leveraging the advanced capability of
a pre-trained GPT-4 model to deduce the order. By providing a specifically
designed prompt along with the input image, GPT-4 can analyze the image and
generate order predictions. The response can then be parsed to construct an
occlusion matrix which can be utilized in assisting with other occlusion
handling tasks and image understanding. We report the results of evaluating the
model on COCOA and InstaOrder datasets. The results show that by using semantic
context, visual patterns, and commonsense knowledge, the model can produce more
accurate order predictions. Unlike baseline methods, the model can reason about
occlusion relationships in a zero-shot fashion, which requires no annotated
training data and can easily be integrated into occlusion handling frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多焦点图像融合方法在保持清晰焦点-散焦边界方面存在困难，往往导致模糊过渡和焦点细节丢失。

Method: 使用梯度域模型获取具有完整边界的初始融合结果，引入Tenengrad梯度检测提取显著特征，开发基于梯度和互补信息的焦点度量进行边界细化。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法在主观和客观评估中均优于12种最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够生成高质量的融合边界，有效检测焦点信息，在多焦点图像融合任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) aims to yield an all-focused image from
multiple partially focused inputs, which is crucial in applications cover
sur-veillance, microscopy, and computational photography. However, existing
methods struggle to preserve sharp focus-defocus boundaries, often resulting in
blurred transitions and focused details loss. To solve this problem, we propose
a MFIF method based on significant boundary enhancement, which generates
high-quality fused boundaries while effectively detecting focus in-formation.
Particularly, we propose a gradient-domain-based model that can obtain initial
fusion results with complete boundaries and effectively pre-serve the boundary
details. Additionally, we introduce Tenengrad gradient detection to extract
salient features from both the source images and the ini-tial fused image,
generating the corresponding saliency maps. For boundary refinement, we develop
a focus metric based on gradient and complementary information, integrating the
salient features with the complementary infor-mation across images to emphasize
focused regions and produce a high-quality initial decision result. Extensive
experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and objective
evaluations. We have realized codes in https://github.com/Lihyua/GICI

TL;DR: 提出TDOA方法，通过聚类训练代理模型将动态输出场景转换为静态单输出场景，使用最远标签目标攻击策略，在动态和静态输出场景下都取得优异攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本对抗攻击方法主要针对静态场景，无法处理动态输出标签空间的问题，需要解决这一局限性。

Method: 采用基于聚类的代理模型训练方法，将动态输出转换为静态单输出；提出最远标签目标攻击策略，选择偏离模型粗粒度标签最多的对抗向量。

Result: 在4个数据集和8个受害者模型上评估，单次查询最大攻击成功率50.81%；在静态场景下最大ASR达82.68%；在生成式场景中超越先前结果0.64 RDBLEU和0.62 RDchrF。

Conclusion: TDOA方法有效解决了动态输出场景的对抗攻击问题，在有限访问条件下对大型语言模型具有强大威胁潜力，同时在传统静态场景也达到最先进性能。

Abstract: Text adversarial attack methods are typically designed for static scenarios
with fixed numbers of output labels and a predefined label space, relying on
extensive querying of the victim model (query-based attacks) or the surrogate
model (transfer-based attacks). To address this gap, we introduce the Textual
Dynamic Outputs Attack (TDOA) method, which employs a clustering-based
surrogate model training approach to convert the dynamic-output scenario into a
static single-output scenario. To improve attack effectiveness, we propose the
farthest-label targeted attack strategy, which selects adversarial vectors that
deviate most from the model's coarse-grained labels, thereby maximizing
disruption. We extensively evaluate TDOA on four datasets and eight victim
models (e.g., ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-4.1), showing its effectiveness in crafting
adversarial examples and its strong potential to compromise large language
models with limited access. With a single query per text, TDOA achieves a
maximum attack success rate of 50.81\%. Additionally, we find that TDOA also
achieves state-of-the-art performance in conventional static output scenarios,
reaching a maximum ASR of 82.68\%. Meanwhile, by conceptualizing translation
tasks as classification problems with unbounded output spaces, we extend the
TDOA framework to generative settings, surpassing prior results by up to 0.64
RDBLEU and 0.62 RDchrF.

Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的医学图像语义分割系统尚未完善，性能有待提升。作者认为通过将医学背景知识融入分割模型的损失函数可以改善性能。

Method: 使用逻辑张量网络（LTNs）通过一阶逻辑规则编码医学背景知识，包括分割形状约束和不同分割区域间的关系，并与SwinUNETR结合构建端到端的分割框架。

Result: 在脑部MRI扫描中分割海马体的实验表明，LTNs能够提升基线分割性能，特别是在训练数据稀缺的情况下效果更明显。

Conclusion: 尽管仍处于初步阶段，但神经符号方法具有足够的通用性，可以适应并应用于其他医学语义分割任务。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis, aiding
medical decision-making by helping radiologists distinguish objects in an
image. Research in this field has been driven by deep learning applications,
which have the potential to scale these systems even in the presence of noise
and artifacts. However, these systems are not yet perfected. We argue that
performance can be improved by incorporating common medical knowledge into the
segmentation model's loss function. To this end, we introduce Logic Tensor
Networks (LTNs) to encode medical background knowledge using first-order logic
(FOL) rules. The encoded rules span from constraints on the shape of the
produced segmentation, to relationships between different segmented areas. We
apply LTNs in an end-to-end framework with a SwinUNETR for semantic
segmentation. We evaluate our method on the task of segmenting the hippocampus
in brain MRI scans. Our experiments show that LTNs improve the baseline
segmentation performance, especially when training data is scarce. Despite
being in its preliminary stages, we argue that neurosymbolic methods are
general enough to be adapted and applied to other medical semantic segmentation
tasks.

Motivation: 视觉自回归模型的快速发展带来了文本到图像生成的新机遇，但也加剧了安全担忧。现有的概念擦除技术主要针对扩散模型设计，无法适用于VAR模型的下一尺度标记预测范式。

Method: 提出VARE框架，利用辅助视觉标记减少微调强度；在此基础上引入S-VARE方法，包含过滤交叉熵损失来精确识别和最小调整不安全视觉标记，以及保持损失来维持语义保真度。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法实现了精确的概念擦除，同时保持了生成质量，弥补了早期方法在自回归文本到图像生成中的安全差距。

Conclusion: S-VARE方法有效解决了朴素微调带来的语言漂移和多样性减少等问题，为自回归文本到图像生成提供了安全解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid progress of visual autoregressive (VAR) models has brought new
opportunities for text-to-image generation, but also heightened safety
concerns. Existing concept erasure techniques, primarily designed for diffusion
models, fail to generalize to VARs due to their next-scale token prediction
paradigm. In this paper, we first propose a novel VAR Erasure framework VARE
that enables stable concept erasure in VAR models by leveraging auxiliary
visual tokens to reduce fine-tuning intensity. Building upon this, we introduce
S-VARE, a novel and effective concept erasure method designed for VAR, which
incorporates a filtered cross entropy loss to precisely identify and minimally
adjust unsafe visual tokens, along with a preservation loss to maintain
semantic fidelity, addressing the issues such as language drift and reduced
diversity introduce by na\"ive fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves surgical concept erasure while preserving generation
quality, thereby closing the safety gap in autoregressive text-to-image
generation by earlier methods.

Motivation: 医学图像中解剖理解的自动化应用受到专家标注数据稀缺的限制，需要开发能够利用参考图像指导目标图像理解的方法。

Method: 首先训练视觉语言模型通过参考图像和目标图像之间的相对空间推理来识别解剖区域，然后将其空间线索与SAM2的精细分割能力相结合，实现像素级分割。

Result: 在两个分布内和两个分布外数据集上，RAU始终优于SAM2微调基线，产生更准确的分割和更可靠的定位，并展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RAU是首个探索视觉语言模型在医学图像中基于参考的解剖结构识别、定位和分割能力的方法，其优异性能突显了VLM驱动方法在自动化临床工作流程中的潜力。

Abstract: Anatomical understanding through deep learning is critical for automatic
report generation, intra-operative navigation, and organ localization in
medical imaging; however, its progress is constrained by the scarcity of
expert-labeled data. A promising remedy is to leverage an annotated reference
image to guide the interpretation of an unlabeled target. Although recent
vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit non-trivial visual reasoning, their
reference-based understanding and fine-grained localization remain limited. We
introduce RAU, a framework for reference-based anatomical understanding with
VLMs. We first show that a VLM learns to identify anatomical regions through
relative spatial reasoning between reference and target images, trained on a
moderately sized dataset. We validate this capability through visual question
answering (VQA) and bounding box prediction. Next, we demonstrate that the
VLM-derived spatial cues can be seamlessly integrated with the fine-grained
segmentation capability of SAM2, enabling localization and pixel-level
segmentation of small anatomical regions, such as vessel segments. Across two
in-distribution and two out-of-distribution datasets, RAU consistently
outperforms a SAM2 fine-tuning baseline using the same memory setup, yielding
more accurate segmentations and more reliable localization. More importantly,
its strong generalization ability makes it scalable to out-of-distribution
datasets, a property crucial for medical image applications. To the best of our
knowledge, RAU is the first to explore the capability of VLMs for
reference-based identification, localization, and segmentation of anatomical
structures in medical images. Its promising performance highlights the
potential of VLM-driven approaches for anatomical understanding in automated
clinical workflows.

TL;DR: 提出了FreqDebias框架，通过频率去偏解决深度伪造检测器中的频谱偏差问题，提升跨域泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造检测器因从有限训练数据中学习到偏差而难以泛化到新的伪造类型，特别是频率域中的频谱偏差问题

Method: 使用Fo-Mixup增强动态多样化频率特征，结合基于CAM的局部一致性和基于vMF分布的全局一致性双重正则化

Result: 在跨域和域内设置下显著提升泛化性能，优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: FreqDebias通过频率去偏有效缓解频谱偏差，显著提升深度伪造检测器的泛化能力

Abstract: Deepfake detectors often struggle to generalize to novel forgery types due to
biases learned from limited training data. In this paper, we identify a new
type of model bias in the frequency domain, termed spectral bias, where
detectors overly rely on specific frequency bands, restricting their ability to
generalize across unseen forgeries. To address this, we propose FreqDebias, a
frequency debiasing framework that mitigates spectral bias through two
complementary strategies. First, we introduce a novel Forgery Mixup (Fo-Mixup)
augmentation, which dynamically diversifies frequency characteristics of
training samples. Second, we incorporate a dual consistency regularization
(CR), which enforces both local consistency using class activation maps (CAMs)
and global consistency through a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on a
hyperspherical embedding space. This dual CR mitigates over-reliance on certain
frequency components by promoting consistent representation learning under both
local and global supervision. Extensive experiments show that FreqDebias
significantly enhances cross-domain generalization and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain and in-domain settings.

TL;DR: LucidFlux是一种无需图像描述的通用图像修复框架，通过适配大型扩散变换器(Flux.1)实现。它采用轻量级双分支调节器来注入退化输入和轻微修复代理的信号，并通过时间步和层级自适应调制调度来保护全局结构同时恢复纹理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决通用图像修复中判别性修复器和UNet扩散先验在未知混合退化条件下容易过度平滑、产生幻觉或漂移的问题，同时避免依赖图像描述带来的延迟和不稳定性。

Method: 1. 轻量级双分支调节器：分别从退化输入和轻微修复代理注入信号以锚定几何形状和抑制伪影
2. 时间步和层级自适应调制调度：在骨干网络层次结构中路由这些线索，实现从粗到细的上下文感知更新
3. 基于SigLIP特征的语义对齐：从代理提取特征实现无描述的语义对齐
4. 可扩展的数据筛选流程：过滤大规模数据以提供结构丰富的监督

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中，LucidFlux始终优于强大的开源和商业基线模型，消融研究验证了每个组件的必要性。

Conclusion: 对于大型扩散变换器，何时、何地以及如何调节——而不是增加参数或依赖文本提示——是在真实世界中实现稳健且无需描述的通用图像修复的关键杠杆。

Abstract: Universal image restoration (UIR) aims to recover images degraded by unknown
mixtures while preserving semantics -- conditions under which discriminative
restorers and UNet-based diffusion priors often oversmooth, hallucinate, or
drift. We present LucidFlux, a caption-free UIR framework that adapts a large
diffusion transformer (Flux.1) without image captions. LucidFlux introduces a
lightweight dual-branch conditioner that injects signals from the degraded
input and a lightly restored proxy to respectively anchor geometry and suppress
artifacts. Then, a timestep- and layer-adaptive modulation schedule is designed
to route these cues across the backbone's hierarchy, in order to yield
coarse-to-fine and context-aware updates that protect the global structure
while recovering texture. After that, to avoid the latency and instability of
text prompts or MLLM captions, we enforce caption-free semantic alignment via
SigLIP features extracted from the proxy. A scalable curation pipeline further
filters large-scale data for structure-rich supervision. Across synthetic and
in-the-wild benchmarks, LucidFlux consistently outperforms strong open-source
and commercial baselines, and ablation studies verify the necessity of each
component. LucidFlux shows that, for large DiTs, when, where, and what to
condition on -- rather than adding parameters or relying on text prompts -- is
the governing lever for robust and caption-free universal image restoration in
the wild.

Motivation: 现有可解释性研究主要关注跨模态归因，忽视了模态内依赖关系。视觉模态中孤立图像块归因忽略空间上下文，文本模态中依赖前文标记引入虚假激活，这些干扰降低了归因保真度。

Method: 视觉分支提出多尺度解释聚合(MSEA)，通过多尺度输入聚合归因来动态调整感受野；文本分支提出激活排序相关(ARC)，通过前k预测排序对齐来测量上下文标记相关性，抑制无关上下文的虚假激活。

Result: 在先进MLLMs和基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法持续优于现有可解释性方法，产生更忠实和细粒度的模型行为解释。

Conclusion: 通过利用模态内交互增强可解释性，提出的MSEA和ARC方法能有效解决视觉空间上下文缺失和文本虚假激活问题，显著提升多模态大语言模型的归因保真度。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet their internal decision-making
mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Existing interpretability research
has primarily focused on cross-modal attribution, identifying which image
regions the model attends to during output generation. However, these
approaches often overlook intra-modal dependencies. In the visual modality,
attributing importance to isolated image patches ignores spatial context due to
limited receptive fields, resulting in fragmented and noisy explanations. In
the textual modality, reliance on preceding tokens introduces spurious
activations. Failing to effectively mitigate these interference compromises
attribution fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose enhancing
interpretability by leveraging intra-modal interaction. For the visual branch,
we introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation} (MSEA), which
aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to dynamically adjust receptive
fields, producing more holistic and spatially coherent visual explanations. For
the textual branch, we propose \textit{Activation Ranking Correlation} (ARC),
which measures the relevance of contextual tokens to the current token via
alignment of their top-$k$ prediction rankings. ARC leverages this relevance to
suppress spurious activations from irrelevant contexts while preserving
semantically coherent ones. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art MLLMs
and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
existing interpretability methods, yielding more faithful and fine-grained
explanations of model behavior.

*Bohan Huang,Qianyun Bao,Haoyuan Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出U-MAN架构，通过渐进注意力引导特征融合和多尺度自适应KAN模块，解决医学图像分割中细节丢失和边界模糊问题，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统U-Net架构存在两个主要限制：(1)简单跳跃连接忽略了编码器-解码器之间的语义差距；(2)缺乏深层多尺度特征提取能力，导致医学图像分割中难以保留细粒度细节和精确边界。

Method: 提出U-MAN架构，包含两个核心模块：渐进注意力引导特征融合(PAGF)模块替代简单跳跃连接，使用注意力机制融合编码器和解码器特征；多尺度自适应KAN(MAN)模块使网络能够自适应处理多尺度特征。

Result: 在三个公开数据集(BUSI、GLAS和CVC)上的实验表明，U-MAN优于最先进的方法，特别是在定义准确边界和保留精细细节方面表现突出。

Conclusion: U-MAN通过改进的注意力机制和多尺度特征处理，有效解决了医学图像分割中的细节保留和边界精度问题，为复杂解剖结构和病理区域的分割提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in preserving
fine-grained details and precise boundaries due to complex anatomical
structures and pathological regions. These challenges primarily stem from two
key limitations of conventional U-Net architectures: (1) their simple skip
connections ignore the encoder-decoder semantic gap between various features,
and (2) they lack the capability for multi-scale feature extraction in deep
layers. To address these challenges, we propose the U-Net with Multi-scale
Adaptive KAN (U-MAN), a novel architecture that enhances the emerging
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with two specialized modules: Progressive
Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (PAGF) and the Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (MAN).
Our PAGF module replaces the simple skip connection, using attention to fuse
features from the encoder and decoder. The MAN module enables the network to
adaptively process features at multiple scales, improving its ability to
segment objects of various sizes. Experiments on three public datasets (BUSI,
GLAS, and CVC) show that U-MAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
particularly in defining accurate boundaries and preserving fine details.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为γ-Quant的任务特定非线性量化方法，用于在低带宽和能量受限环境下优化模式识别性能，在仅使用4位量化数据时能达到与12位原始数据相当的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模式识别模型通常使用预处理数据，但许多现代视觉任务和可穿戴设备活动识别不需要人类参与，这种预处理可能不是最优的。特别是在低带宽和能量受限环境下，传感器只能进行低比特深度采集，需要更高效的数据处理方法。

Method: 提出γ-Quant方法，通过学习任务特定的非线性量化函数来优化模式识别。该方法在原始图像目标检测和可穿戴设备活动识别任务上进行验证，使用可学习的量化函数处理低比特深度数据。

Result: 实验表明，使用仅4位可学习量化的原始数据在性能上可以与使用12位原始数据的传统方法相媲美，显著提高了数据传输效率并延长了可穿戴设备的电池寿命。

Conclusion: γ-Quant方法证明了在低比特深度设置下，通过学习任务特定的非线性量化可以保持模式识别性能，为低带宽和能量受限环境下的传感器应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Most pattern recognition models are developed on pre-proce\-ssed data. In
computer vision, for instance, RGB images processed through image signal
processing (ISP) pipelines designed to cater to human perception are the most
frequent input to image analysis networks. However, many modern vision tasks
operate without a human in the loop, raising the question of whether such
pre-processing is optimal for automated analysis. Similarly, human activity
recognition (HAR) on body-worn sensor data commonly takes normalized
floating-point data arising from a high-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
as an input, despite such an approach being highly inefficient in terms of data
transmission, significantly affecting the battery life of wearable devices. In
this work, we target low-bandwidth and energy-constrained settings where
sensors are limited to low-bit-depth capture. We propose $\gamma$-Quant,
i.e.~the task-specific learning of a non-linear quantization for pattern
recognition. We exemplify our approach on raw-image object detection as well as
HAR of wearable data, and demonstrate that raw data with a learnable
quantization using as few as 4-bits can perform on par with the use of raw
12-bit data. All code to reproduce our experiments is publicly available via

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督训练框架SSVIF，用于分割导向的可见光-红外图像融合方法，无需分割标签即可学习高级语义特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决应用导向的VIF方法需要下游任务标注数据的问题，传统方法只关注融合图像质量，而应用导向方法需要分割或检测标注，数据获取成本高。

Method: 利用特征级融合分割和像素级融合分割之间的一致性，提出跨分割一致性自监督任务，设计两阶段训练策略和动态权重调整方法。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，SSVIF仅使用未标注的可见光-红外图像对训练，就能超越传统VIF方法，与有监督的分割导向方法相媲美。

Conclusion: 提出的自监督框架有效解决了应用导向VIF方法的数据标注问题，实现了无需分割标签的高性能分割导向图像融合。

Abstract: Visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) has gained significant attention in
recent years due to its wide application in tasks such as scene segmentation
and object detection. VIF methods can be broadly classified into traditional
VIF methods and application-oriented VIF methods. Traditional methods focus
solely on improving the quality of fused images, while application-oriented VIF
methods additionally consider the performance of downstream tasks on fused
images by introducing task-specific loss terms during training. However,
compared to traditional methods, application-oriented VIF methods require
datasets labeled for downstream tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation or object
detection), making data acquisition labor-intensive and time-consuming. To
address this issue, we propose a self-supervised training framework for
segmentation-oriented VIF methods (SSVIF). Leveraging the consistency between
feature-level fusion-based segmentation and pixel-level fusion-based
segmentation, we introduce a novel self-supervised task-cross-segmentation
consistency-that enables the fusion model to learn high-level semantic features
without the supervision of segmentation labels. Additionally, we design a
two-stage training strategy and a dynamic weight adjustment method for
effective joint learning within our self-supervised framework. Extensive
experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
SSVIF. Remarkably, although trained only on unlabeled visible-infrared image
pairs, our SSVIF outperforms traditional VIF methods and rivals supervised
segmentation-oriented ones. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 解决医学影像跨域适应中GAN风格迁移难以处理高变异性区域的问题，提升域适应性能。

Method: 1) 使用Bézier曲线风格迁移减少域间差异；2) 基于分割模型生成伪标签；3) 训练条件扩散模型合成高质量目标域图像；4) 开发不确定性引导的分数匹配方法处理噪声伪标签。

Result: 在公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法能生成逼真的标注图像，显著增强目标域数据并提升分割性能。

Conclusion: Bézier Meets Diffusion框架有效解决了跨域医学图像生成问题，通过风格迁移和扩散模型的结合实现了高质量的域适应。

Abstract: Training robust learning algorithms across different medical imaging
modalities is challenging due to the large domain gap. Unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) mitigates this problem by using annotated images from the
source domain and unlabeled images from the target domain to train the deep
models. Existing approaches often rely on GAN-based style transfer, but these
methods struggle to capture cross-domain mappings in regions with high
variability. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, B\'ezier Meets
Diffusion, for cross-domain image generation. First, we introduce a
B\'ezier-curve-based style transfer strategy that effectively reduces the
domain gap between source and target domains. The transferred source images
enable the training of a more robust segmentation model across domains.
Thereafter, using pseudo-labels generated by this segmentation model on the
target domain, we train a conditional diffusion model (CDM) to synthesize
high-quality, labeled target-domain images. To mitigate the impact of noisy
pseudo-labels, we further develop an uncertainty-guided score matching method
that improves the robustness of CDM training. Extensive experiments on public
datasets demonstrate that our approach generates realistic labeled images,
significantly augmenting the target domain and improving segmentation
performance.

TL;DR: 提出PSTTS（渐进式时空令牌选择）模块，利用事件数据的时空分布特性识别和丢弃冗余令牌，在保持精度的同时显著提升计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于事件帧的方法忽略了事件帧序列的高空间稀疏性和帧间运动冗余，导致计算开销大；现有的RGB视频令牌稀疏化方法不适用于事件数据

Method: PSTTS包含两个阶段：空间令牌净化（通过评估事件帧内事件的时空一致性来丢弃噪声和非事件区域）和时序令牌选择（通过评估相邻事件帧间的运动模式相似性来移除冗余时序信息）

Result: 在HARDVS、DailyDVS-200和SeACT数据集上测试，PSTTS显著提升效率：在DailyDVS-200数据集上减少FLOPs 29-43.6%，提升FPS 21.6-41.3%，同时保持任务精度

Conclusion: PSTTS是一个无需额外参数的即插即用模块，能够有效处理事件数据的时空冗余问题，实现精度与效率的最佳平衡

Abstract: Mainstream event-based spatio-temporal representation learning methods
typically process event streams by converting them into sequences of event
frames, achieving remarkable performance. However, they neglect the high
spatial sparsity and inter-frame motion redundancy inherent in event frame
sequences, leading to significant computational overhead. Existing token
sparsification methods for RGB videos rely on unreliable intermediate token
representations and neglect the influence of event noise, making them
ineffective for direct application to event data. In this paper, we propose
Progressive Spatio-Temporal Token Selection (PSTTS), a Plug-and-Play module for
event data without introducing any additional parameters. PSTTS exploits the
spatio-temporal distribution characteristics embedded in raw event data to
effectively identify and discard spatio-temporal redundant tokens, achieving an
optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, PSTTS consists
of two stages, Spatial Token Purification and Temporal Token Selection. Spatial
Token Purification discards noise and non-event regions by assessing the
spatio-temporal consistency of events within each event frame to prevent
interference with subsequent temporal redundancy evaluation. Temporal Token
Selection evaluates the motion pattern similarity between adjacent event
frames, precisely identifying and removing redundant temporal information. We
apply PSTTS to four representative backbones UniformerV2, VideoSwin, EVMamba,
and ExACT on the HARDVS, DailyDVS-200, and SeACT datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that PSTTS achieves significant efficiency improvements.
Specifically, PSTTS reduces FLOPs by 29-43.6% and increases FPS by 21.6-41.3%
on the DailyDVS-200 dataset, while maintaining task accuracy. Our code will be
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了GCPO方法，通过识别关键图像token并进行针对性优化，在RLVR自回归视觉生成中实现更高效的策略优化，仅使用30%的token就能达到比全token优化更好的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对所有图像token进行统一优化，但不同token对RLVR训练的贡献差异未被探索。关键挑战在于如何在AR生成过程中识别更关键的图像token并实现有效的token级优化。

Method: 从三个角度识别关键token：因果依赖（早期token决定后期token）、熵诱导的空间结构（高熵梯度token对应图像结构）、RLVR聚焦的token多样性（低视觉相似度token）。引入动态token级优势权重来鼓励探索。

Result: 在多个文本到图像基准测试中，GCPO仅使用30%的图像token就实现了比全token GRPO更好的性能，适用于AR模型和统一多模态模型。

Conclusion: GCPO通过识别和优化关键token，在RLVR自回归视觉生成中实现了更高效的策略优化，证明了token级优化的重要性。

Abstract: Recent studies have extended Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) to autoregressive (AR) visual generation and achieved promising
progress. However, existing methods typically apply uniform optimization across
all image tokens, while the varying contributions of different image tokens for
RLVR's training remain unexplored. In fact, the key obstacle lies in how to
identify more critical image tokens during AR generation and implement
effective token-wise optimization for them. To tackle this challenge, we
propose $\textbf{G}$roup $\textbf{C}$ritical-token $\textbf{P}$olicy
$\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{GCPO}$), which facilitates effective policy
optimization on critical tokens. We identify the critical tokens in RLVR-based
AR generation from three perspectives, specifically: $\textbf{(1)}$ Causal
dependency: early tokens fundamentally determine the later tokens and final
image effect due to unidirectional dependency; $\textbf{(2)}$ Entropy-induced
spatial structure: tokens with high entropy gradients correspond to image
structure and bridges distinct visual regions; $\textbf{(3)}$ RLVR-focused
token diversity: tokens with low visual similarity across a group of sampled
images contribute to richer token-level diversity. For these identified
critical tokens, we further introduce a dynamic token-wise advantage weight to
encourage exploration, based on confidence divergence between the policy model
and reference model. By leveraging 30\% of the image tokens, GCPO achieves
better performance than GRPO with full tokens. Extensive experiments on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks for both AR models and unified multimodal
models demonstrate the effectiveness of GCPO for AR visual generation.

TL;DR: EAGLE是一个轻量级黑盒框架，用于解释多模态大语言模型中的自回归token生成，通过将生成的token归因于紧凑的感知区域，并量化语言先验和感知证据的相对影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉输入与自然语言输出对齐方面表现出色，但生成的token对视觉模态的依赖程度尚不清楚，这限制了模型的可解释性和可靠性。

Method: EAGLE引入了一个目标函数，统一了充分性（洞察分数）和必要性（必要分数），通过贪心搜索在稀疏化图像区域上进行优化，实现忠实且高效的归因。

Result: 在开源多模态大语言模型上的广泛实验表明，EAGLE在忠实性、定位性和幻觉诊断方面始终优于现有方法，同时需要显著更少的GPU内存。

Conclusion: EAGLE在提升多模态大语言模型可解释性方面具有有效性和实用性，为理解模型决策提供了细粒度的解释能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in aligning visual inputs with natural language outputs. Yet, the
extent to which generated tokens depend on visual modalities remains poorly
understood, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this work, we present
EAGLE, a lightweight black-box framework for explaining autoregressive token
generation in MLLMs. EAGLE attributes any selected tokens to compact perceptual
regions while quantifying the relative influence of language priors and
perceptual evidence. The framework introduces an objective function that
unifies sufficiency (insight score) and indispensability (necessity score),
optimized via greedy search over sparsified image regions for faithful and
efficient attribution. Beyond spatial attribution, EAGLE performs
modality-aware analysis that disentangles what tokens rely on, providing
fine-grained interpretability of model decisions. Extensive experiments across
open-source MLLMs show that EAGLE consistently outperforms existing methods in
faithfulness, localization, and hallucination diagnosis, while requiring
substantially less GPU memory. These results highlight its effectiveness and
practicality for advancing the interpretability of MLLMs. The code is available

Motivation: 颜色是人类视觉感知的基本维度，理解视觉语言模型是否像人类一样命名颜色对于有效的人机交互至关重要。

Method: 使用957个颜色样本，在五个代表性模型上复制经典颜色命名方法，进行跨语言分析和消融研究。

Result: 模型在原型颜色上准确率高，但在扩展的非原型颜色集上性能显著下降；识别出21个常用颜色术语；发现英语和中文存在严重的训练不平衡；语言模型架构独立影响颜色命名。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在颜色命名方面存在局限性，特别是在非原型颜色和跨语言场景中，语言模型架构对颜色命名有显著影响。

Abstract: Color serves as a fundamental dimension of human visual perception and a
primary means of communicating about objects and scenes. As vision-language
models (VLMs) become increasingly prevalent, understanding whether they name
colors like humans is crucial for effective human-AI interaction. We present
the first systematic evaluation of color naming capabilities across VLMs,
replicating classic color naming methodologies using 957 color samples across
five representative models. Our results show that while VLMs achieve high
accuracy on prototypical colors from classical studies, performance drops
significantly on expanded, non-prototypical color sets. We identify 21 common
color terms that consistently emerge across all models, revealing two distinct
approaches: constrained models using predominantly basic terms versus expansive
models employing systematic lightness modifiers. Cross-linguistic analysis
across nine languages demonstrates severe training imbalances favoring English
and Chinese, with hue serving as the primary driver of color naming decisions.
Finally, ablation studies reveal that language model architecture significantly
influences color naming independent of visual processing capabilities.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) plays a pivotal role in various computer
vision applications, such as robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous
driving. Despite recent advancements, existing methods often fail to meet key
requirements for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, including geometric
consistency, fine details, robustness to real-world challenges like reflective
surfaces, and efficiency for edge devices. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel MDE system, called EfficientDepth, which combines a
transformer architecture with a lightweight convolutional decoder, as well as a
bimodal density head that allows the network to estimate detailed depth maps.
We train our model on a combination of labeled synthetic and real images, as
well as pseudo-labeled real images, generated using a high-performing MDE
method. Furthermore, we employ a multi-stage optimization strategy to improve
training efficiency and produce models that emphasize geometric consistency and
fine detail. Finally, in addition to commonly used objectives, we introduce a
loss function based on LPIPS to encourage the network to produce detailed depth
maps. Experimental results demonstrate that EfficientDepth achieves performance
comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art models, with
significantly reduced computational resources.

Abstract: Category discovery (CD) is an emerging open-world learning task, which aims
at automatically categorizing unlabelled data containing instances from unseen
classes, given some labelled data from seen classes. This task has attracted
significant attention over the years and leads to a rich body of literature
trying to address the problem from different perspectives. In this survey, we
provide a comprehensive review of the literature, and offer detailed analysis
and in-depth discussion on different methods. Firstly, we introduce a taxonomy
for the literature by considering two base settings, namely novel category
discovery (NCD) and generalized category discovery (GCD), and several derived
settings that are designed to address the extra challenges in different
real-world application scenarios, including continual category discovery,
skewed data distribution, federated category discovery, etc. Secondly, for each
setting, we offer a detailed analysis of the methods encompassing three
fundamental components, representation learning, label assignment, and
estimation of class number. Thirdly, we benchmark all the methods and distill
key insights showing that large-scale pretrained backbones, hierarchical and
auxiliary cues, and curriculum-style training are all beneficial for category
discovery, while challenges remain in the design of label assignment, the
estimation of class numbers, and scaling to complex multi-object
scenarios.Finally, we discuss the key insights from the literature so far and
point out promising future research directions. We compile a living survey of

Motivation: 现有方法难以检测复杂异常，SSL方法缺乏语义理解能力，而LLM方法计算成本高且缺乏细粒度空间定位。

Method: 使用nnFormer骨干网络的多任务SSL时序分析器识别可疑帧，然后通过LLM进行基于规则的结构化推理验证异常。

Result: 在ComplexVAD数据集上达到72.5%帧级AUC，比基线方法提升12.5%，同时减少了LLM计算量。

Conclusion: HyCoVAD通过SSL-LLM混合方法有效解决了复杂视频异常检测问题，并发布了交互异常分类法和自适应阈值协议以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a
significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events
defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple
entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL)
methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often
struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large
language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are
computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained
spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly
Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal
analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone
which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with
multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of
anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the
analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to
validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD
dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming
existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our
interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to
facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VLN方法依赖显式语义记忆（如文本认知地图或历史视觉帧），存在空间信息丢失、计算冗余和内存膨胀等问题，阻碍了高效导航。受人类导航中隐式场景表示的启发，提出了双隐式神经记忆框架。

Method: 扩展MLLM以融入来自空间几何编码器的3D先验知识，增强仅基于RGB输入的空间推理能力。构建空间几何和视觉语义编码器的历史键值缓存作为双隐式记忆，仅保留初始和滑动窗口中的token的KVs，避免冗余计算，实现高效增量更新。

Result: 在广泛实验中，JanusVLN超越了20多种最新方法，达到SOTA性能。与使用多种数据类型输入的方法相比，成功率提高了10.5-35.5；与使用更多RGB训练数据的方法相比，成功率提高了3.6-10.8。

Conclusion: 提出的双隐式神经记忆作为一种新颖范式，为未来VLN研究探索了有前景的新方向。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation requires an embodied agent to navigate through
unseen environments, guided by natural language instructions and a continuous
video stream. Recent advances in VLN have been driven by the powerful semantic
understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, these methods
typically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitive
maps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers from
spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which
impede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in
human navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the
right brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework
featuring a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and
visual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural
representations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior
knowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial
reasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the
historical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic
encoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs
of tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided,
enabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
JanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For
example, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using
multiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB
training data. This indicates that the proposed dual implicit neural memory, as
a novel paradigm, explores promising new directions for future VLN research.

### [147] [SpikeMatch: Semi-Supervised Learning with Temporal Dynamics of Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22581)
*Jini Yang,Beomseok Oh,Seungryong Kim,Sunok Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpikeMatch是首个针对脉冲神经网络的半监督学习框架，利用SNN的时序动态特性进行多样化伪标签生成，在有限标签下实现高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络具有生物合理性和能效优势，但其半监督学习方法相比人工神经网络研究不足，需要开发专门针对SNN特性的SSL框架。

Method: 通过SNN的泄漏因子利用时序动态，在协同训练框架中生成多样化伪标签，使用弱增强未标记样本生成可靠伪标签来训练强增强样本，减少确认偏差。

Result: 实验表明SpikeMatch在各种标准基准测试中优于现有适应SNN骨干网络的SSL方法。

Conclusion: SpikeMatch成功证明了利用SNN时序动态特性进行半监督学习的有效性，为SNN的SSL研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently been attracting significant
attention for their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, but
semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods for SNN-based models remain
underexplored compared to those for artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this
paper, we introduce SpikeMatch, the first SSL framework for SNNs that leverages
the temporal dynamics through the leakage factor of SNNs for diverse
pseudo-labeling within a co-training framework. By utilizing agreement among
multiple predictions from a single SNN, SpikeMatch generates reliable
pseudo-labels from weakly-augmented unlabeled samples to train on
strongly-augmented ones, effectively mitigating confirmation bias by capturing
discriminative features with limited labels. Experiments show that SpikeMatch
outperforms existing SSL methods adapted to SNN backbones across various
standard benchmarks.

### [148] [Vision-Language Alignment from Compressed Image Representations using 2D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22615)
*Yasmine Omri,Connor Ding,Tsachy Weissman,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文探索使用2D高斯泼溅(2DGS)作为视觉语言模型的替代视觉表示，相比传统RGB像素，2DGS能显著压缩输入数据(3-20倍)并减少计算复杂度，同时保持有意义的零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉语言模型的两个结构性问题：(i)从边缘设备传输密集RGB图像到云端能耗高、成本大；(ii)基于patch的tokenization导致序列长度爆炸，增加注意力计算负担。

Method: 开发可扩展的2DGS流水线，包括结构化初始化、亮度感知剪枝和批量CUDA内核；通过轻量级splat感知输入主干和感知器重采样器，在冻结的RGB transformer骨干上适配对比语言图像预训练(CLIP)，仅训练约7%的参数。

Result: 2DGS编码器在DataComp子集上实现了有意义的零样本ImageNet-1K性能，输入压缩比达到3-20倍，拟合速度比先前实现快90倍以上，GPU利用率约97%。

Conclusion: 2DGS被确立为可行的多模态基板，虽然当前精度仍低于RGB编码器，但为开发既语义强大又传输高效的边缘-云端学习表示开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Modern vision language pipelines are driven by RGB vision encoders trained on
massive image text corpora. While these pipelines have enabled impressive zero
shot capabilities and strong transfer across tasks, they still inherit two
structural inefficiencies from the pixel domain: (i) transmitting dense RGB
images from edge devices to the cloud is energy intensive and costly, and (ii)
patch based tokenization explodes sequence length, stressing attention budgets
and context limits. We explore 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) as an alternative
visual substrate for alignment: a compact, spatially adaptive representation
that parameterizes images by a set of colored anisotropic Gaussians. We develop
a scalable 2DGS pipeline with structured initialization, luminance aware
pruning, and batched CUDA kernels, achieving over 90x faster fitting and about
97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations. We further adapt
contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) to 2DGS by reusing a frozen
RGB-based transformer backbone with a lightweight splat aware input stem and a
perceiver resampler, training only about 7% of the total parameters. On large
DataComp subsets, GS encoders yield meaningful zero shot ImageNet-1K
performance while compressing inputs 3 to 20x relative to pixels. While
accuracy currently trails RGB encoders, our results establish 2DGS as a viable
multimodal substrate, pinpoint architectural bottlenecks, and open a path
toward representations that are both semantically powerful and transmission
efficient for edge cloud learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongLive是一个用于实时交互式长视频生成的帧级自回归框架，通过KV重缓存机制、流式长调优和帧级注意力池等技术，解决了长视频生成的效率和质量问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频生成面临效率和质量的双重挑战：扩散模型质量高但效率低，因果注意力AR模型支持KV缓存但长视频训练时质量下降。此外，交互式能力对于动态内容创作至关重要，但增加了视觉一致性和语义连贯性的复杂性。

Method: 采用因果帧级自回归设计，集成KV重缓存机制用于平滑提示切换，流式长调优实现长视频训练和训练-推理对齐，短窗口注意力配合帧级注意力池保持长程一致性并加速生成。

Result: 在32 GPU天内将13亿参数的短片段模型微调至分钟级生成，在单个NVIDIA H100上保持20.7 FPS，在VBench上短长视频均表现优异，支持单H100 GPU上240秒视频生成，INT8量化推理仅轻微质量损失。

Conclusion: LongLive通过创新的框架设计成功解决了长视频生成的效率、质量和交互性问题，实现了实时、高质量的分钟级视频生成能力。

Abstract: We present LongLive, a frame-level autoregressive (AR) framework for
real-time and interactive long video generation. Long video generation presents
challenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing
models can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to
bidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for
faster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory
challenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based
generation, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are
critical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in
real time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity,
especially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt
transitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level
AR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states
with new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable
long video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);
and short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as
frame sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.
With these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model
to minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains
20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both
short and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a single
H100 GPU. LongLive further supports INT8-quantized inference with only marginal
quality loss.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPARK框架是一种高效的协同进化方法，通过回收RLVR中的rollouts和正确性数据来同时训练模型作为生成式奖励模型，无需独立奖励模型或人工偏好数据，在多个基准测试中取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RLHF成本高和奖励策略不匹配问题，以及RLVR浪费监督信号的问题，提出更高效的协同进化框架。

Method: 基于RLVR构建SPARK框架，回收rollouts和正确性数据，通过点对点奖励评分、成对比较和反思条件评估等目标训练模型作为生成式奖励模型，实现策略和奖励的协同进化。

Result: SPARK-VL-7B在7个推理基准上平均提升9.7%，2个奖励基准上提升12.1%，8个通用基准上提升1.5%，显示出鲁棒性和广泛泛化能力。

Conclusion: SPARK框架通过策略和奖励的协同进化，实现了高效、稳定的强化学习训练，无需外部奖励模型，在多个模型和基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
increasingly use Reinforcement Learning (RL) for post-pretraining, such as RL
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for objective tasks and RL from Human Feedback
(RLHF) for subjective tasks. However, RLHF incurs high costs and potential
reward-policy mismatch due to reliance on human preferences, while RLVR still
wastes supervision by discarding rollouts and correctness signals after each
update. To address these challenges, we introduce the Synergistic Policy And
Reward Co-Evolving Framework (SPARK), an efficient, on-policy, and stable
method that builds on RLVR. Instead of discarding rollouts and correctness
data, SPARK recycles this valuable information to simultaneously train the
model itself as a generative reward model. This auxiliary training uses a mix
of objectives, such as pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, and
evaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses, to teach the model to
evaluate and improve its own responses. Our process eliminates the need for a
separate reward model and costly human preference data. SPARK creates a
positive co-evolving feedback loop: improved reward accuracy yields better
policy gradients, which in turn produce higher-quality rollouts that further
refine the reward model. Our unified framework supports test-time scaling via
self-reflection without external reward models and their associated costs. We
show that SPARK achieves significant performance gains on multiple LLM and LVLM
models and multiple reasoning, reward models, and general benchmarks. For
example, SPARK-VL-7B achieves an average 9.7% gain on 7 reasoning benchmarks,
12.1% on 2 reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on 8 general benchmarks over the
baselines, demonstrating robustness and broad generalization.

*Alexandre Lopes,Roberto Souza,Helio Pedrini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CCNeXt的新型自监督深度估计方法，在保持计算效率的同时超越了现有CNN和ViT模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度估计在机器人、自动驾驶和增强现实中至关重要，但这些场景通常受计算能力限制。由于在不同场景中获取可靠深度真值数据困难，当有大量未标记数据集可用时，自监督技术成为解决方案

Method: CCNeXt架构采用现代CNN特征提取器，在编码器中包含新颖的窗口化极线交叉注意力模块，并全面重新设计了深度估计解码器

Result: 在KITTI Eigen Split测试数据上达到有竞争力的指标，比当前最佳模型快10.18倍，在KITTI Eigen Split改进真值和Driving Stereo数据集的所有指标上都达到了最先进水平

Conclusion: CCNeXt在深度估计任务中实现了性能与计算效率的良好平衡，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Depth Estimation plays a crucial role in recent applications in robotics,
autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality. These scenarios commonly operate
under constraints imposed by computational power. Stereo image pairs offer an
effective solution for depth estimation since it only needs to estimate the
disparity of pixels in image pairs to determine the depth in a known rectified
system. Due to the difficulty in acquiring reliable ground-truth depth data
across diverse scenarios, self-supervised techniques emerge as a solution,
particularly when large unlabeled datasets are available. We propose a novel
self-supervised convolutional approach that outperforms existing
state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers
(ViTs) while balancing computational cost. The proposed CCNeXt architecture
employs a modern CNN feature extractor with a novel windowed epipolar
cross-attention module in the encoder, complemented by a comprehensive redesign
of the depth estimation decoder. Our experiments demonstrate that CCNeXt
achieves competitive metrics on the KITTI Eigen Split test data while being
10.18$\times$ faster than the current best model and achieves state-of-the-art
results in all metrics in the KITTI Eigen Split Improved Ground Truth and
Driving Stereo datasets when compared to recently proposed techniques. To

*Hongyu Chen,Guangrun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UML-CoT是一个结构化推理框架，使用统一建模语言(UML)生成符号思维链和可执行行动计划，在杂乱房间清洁场景中优于非结构化CoT方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统思维链(CoT)提示依赖非结构化文本，在具身任务中可解释性和可执行性有限。现有结构化CoT方法只能建模低阶关系，缺乏继承或行为抽象等构造，也没有顺序或条件规划的标准语义。

Method: 提出UML-CoT框架，使用UML类图捕捉组合对象语义，活动图建模过程控制流。采用三阶段训练管道，结合监督微调和组相对策略优化(GRPO)，包括从仅答案数据中学习奖励。

Result: 在MRoom-30k基准测试中，UML-CoT在可解释性、规划连贯性和执行成功率方面优于非结构化CoT方法。

Conclusion: UML作为一种更具表达性和可操作性的结构化推理形式主义，在具身推理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models
(LLMs), but its reliance on unstructured text limits interpretability and
executability in embodied tasks. Prior work has explored structured CoTs using
scene or logic graphs, yet these remain fundamentally limited: they model only
low-order relations, lack constructs like inheritance or behavioral
abstraction, and provide no standardized semantics for sequential or
conditional planning. We propose UML-CoT, a structured reasoning and planning
framework that leverages Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate symbolic
CoTs and executable action plans. UML class diagrams capture compositional
object semantics, while activity diagrams model procedural control flow. Our
three-stage training pipeline combines supervised fine-tuning with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), including reward learning from answer-only
data. We evaluate UML-CoT on MRoom-30k, a new benchmark of cluttered
room-cleaning scenarios. UML-CoT outperforms unstructured CoTs in
interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success, highlighting UML
as a more expressive and actionable structured reasoning formalism.

TL;DR: Labeling Copilot是首个用于计算机视觉的数据策展深度研究代理，通过多模态语言模型驱动的中央编排器，执行三个核心功能：校准发现、可控合成和共识标注，有效解决大规模数据集构建的质量、多样性和成本平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建高质量、领域特定的数据集是部署稳健视觉系统的主要瓶颈，需要在数据质量、多样性和成本之间进行复杂权衡，特别是在处理海量未标记数据时。

Method: 使用多模态语言模型驱动的中央编排器进行多步推理，执行三个核心工具：校准发现从大型存储库中获取相关数据；可控合成生成罕见场景的新数据；共识标注通过结合非极大值抑制和投票的新颖共识机制协调多个基础模型产生准确标签。

Result: 在密集COCO数据集上，共识标注模块平均每张图像产生14.2个候选建议，几乎是真实标注7.4个对象的两倍，最终标注mAP达到37.1%。在Open Images数据集上发现了903个新的边界框类别，总能力扩展到1500多个类别。校准发现在1000万样本规模测试中，主动学习策略的计算效率比替代方案高40倍。

Conclusion: 具有优化、可扩展工具的代理工作流程为构建工业规模数据集提供了稳健基础。

Abstract: Curating high-quality, domain-specific datasets is a major bottleneck for
deploying robust vision systems, requiring complex trade-offs between data
quality, diversity, and cost when researching vast, unlabeled data lakes. We
introduce Labeling Copilot, the first data curation deep research agent for
computer vision. A central orchestrator agent, powered by a large multimodal
language model, uses multi-step reasoning to execute specialized tools across
three core capabilities: (1) Calibrated Discovery sources relevant,
in-distribution data from large repositories; (2) Controllable Synthesis
generates novel data for rare scenarios with robust filtering; and (3)
Consensus Annotation produces accurate labels by orchestrating multiple
foundation models via a novel consensus mechanism incorporating non-maximum
suppression and voting. Our large-scale validation proves the effectiveness of
Labeling Copilot's components. The Consensus Annotation module excels at object
discovery: on the dense COCO dataset, it averages 14.2 candidate proposals per
image-nearly double the 7.4 ground-truth objects-achieving a final annotation
mAP of 37.1%. On the web-scale Open Images dataset, it navigated extreme class
imbalance to discover 903 new bounding box categories, expanding its capability
to over 1500 total. Concurrently, our Calibrated Discovery tool, tested at a
10-million sample scale, features an active learning strategy that is up to 40x
more computationally efficient than alternatives with equivalent sample
efficiency. These experiments validate that an agentic workflow with optimized,
scalable tools provides a robust foundation for curating industrial-scale
datasets.

Motivation: 解决少样本图像分类中标记数据有限的问题，避免现有方法需要模型微调或外部信息源的依赖。

Method: 使用IP-Adapter进行图像到图像转换，引入扩展的无分类器引导方案、基于类相似性的采样策略，无需模型微调或外部标注过滤。

Result: 在十个基准数据集上达到最先进或可比性能，无需生成模型适应或依赖外部工具进行标题生成和图像过滤。

Conclusion: 通过正负引导的双图像提示方法在生成类判别特征方面非常有效，特别适用于细粒度分类任务。

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the limited
availability of labeled examples. Recent approaches have explored generating
synthetic training data using text-to-image diffusion models, but often require
extensive model fine-tuning or external information sources. We present a novel
training-free approach, called DIPSY, that leverages IP-Adapter for
image-to-image translation to generate highly discriminative synthetic images
using only the available few-shot examples. DIPSY introduces three key
innovations: (1) an extended classifier-free guidance scheme that enables
independent control over positive and negative image conditioning; (2) a class
similarity-based sampling strategy that identifies effective contrastive
examples; and (3) a simple yet effective pipeline that requires no model
fine-tuning or external captioning and filtering. Experiments across ten
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or
comparable performance, while eliminating the need for generative model
adaptation or reliance on external tools for caption generation and image
filtering. Our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging dual image
prompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative
features, particularly for fine-grained classification tasks.

Motivation: 重新审视VAR模型，揭示其与扩散模型的数学等价性，以结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出SRDD框架，将扩散模型的迭代优化和架构效率优势直接引入VAR模型。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了更快的收敛、更低的推理成本和更好的零样本重建性能。

Conclusion: 基于扩散视角的VAR模型在效率和生成质量方面都取得了持续提升。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) transformers have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
visual generation, largely due to their scalability, computational efficiency
and unified architecture with language and vision. Among them, next scale
prediction Visual Autoregressive Generation (VAR) has recently demonstrated
remarkable performance, even surpassing diffusion-based models. In this work,
we revisit VAR and uncover a theoretical insight: when equipped with a
Markovian attention mask, VAR is mathematically equivalent to a discrete
diffusion. We term this reinterpretation as Scalable Visual Refinement with
Discrete Diffusion (SRDD), establishing a principled bridge between AR
transformers and diffusion models. Leveraging this new perspective, we show how
one can directly import the advantages of diffusion such as iterative
refinement and reduce architectural inefficiencies into VAR, yielding faster
convergence, lower inference cost, and improved zero-shot reconstruction.
Across multiple datasets, we show that the diffusion based perspective of VAR
leads to consistent gains in efficiency and generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HERMAN方法通过利用LLM生成层次化文本描述符，增强CLIP在类增量学习中的语义空间，通过分层表示匹配解决细粒度识别和灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP类增量学习方法使用简单模板（如"a photo of a [CLASS]"），忽略了视觉概念的层次性，且仅使用最后一层特征，忽略了早期层的层次信息。

Method: 利用LLM递归生成判别性文本描述符，将这些描述符匹配到语义层次的不同级别，并根据任务需求自适应路由，实现精确区分同时缓解灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法持续实现最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HERMAN通过层次化表示匹配有效提升了CLIP在类增量学习中的表现，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to endow models with the ability to
continuously adapt to evolving data streams. Recent advances in pre-trained
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) provide a powerful foundation for this
task. However, existing approaches often rely on simplistic templates, such as
"a photo of a [CLASS]", which overlook the hierarchical nature of visual
concepts. For example, recognizing "cat" versus "car" depends on coarse-grained
cues, while distinguishing "cat" from "lion" requires fine-grained details.
Similarly, the current feature mapping in CLIP relies solely on the
representation from the last layer, neglecting the hierarchical information
contained in earlier layers. In this work, we introduce HiErarchical
Representation MAtchiNg (HERMAN) for CLIP-based CIL. Our approach leverages
LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, thereby
augmenting the semantic space with explicit hierarchical cues. These
descriptors are matched to different levels of the semantic hierarchy and
adaptively routed based on task-specific requirements, enabling precise
discrimination while alleviating catastrophic forgetting in incremental tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: DeeptraceReward是首个细粒度、时空感知的基准数据集，用于标注人类感知的AI视频伪造痕迹，包含4.3K个详细标注，训练的多模态奖励模型在伪造线索识别、定位和解释方面优于GPT-5 34.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频生成模型快速发展，但人类是否能检测生成视频中的深度伪造痕迹这一关键维度被忽视，需要建立能评估人类感知伪造痕迹的基准。

Method: 构建包含4.3K详细标注的数据集，每个标注提供自然语言解释、边界框区域定位和精确时间戳，将标注整合为9类深度伪造痕迹，训练多模态语言模型作为奖励模型。

Result: 7B奖励模型在伪造线索识别、定位和解释方面平均优于GPT-5 34.7%，发现难度梯度：二元分类最容易，自然语言解释次之，空间定位更难，时间标注最难。

Conclusion: 通过突出人类感知的深度伪造痕迹，DeeptraceReward为社会意识和可信视频生成提供了严格的测试平台和训练信号。

Abstract: Can humans identify AI-generated (fake) videos and provide grounded reasons?
While video generation models have advanced rapidly, a critical dimension --
whether humans can detect deepfake traces within a generated video, i.e.,
spatiotemporal grounded visual artifacts that reveal a video as machine
generated -- has been largely overlooked. We introduce DeeptraceReward, the
first fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates
human-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises
4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each
annotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box
region containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset
timestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of
deepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train
multimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and
localizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by
34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation.
Interestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s.
real classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace
detection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language
explanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest).
By foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a
rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video
generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CapRL框架，使用强化学习与可验证奖励来训练图像描述模型，通过非视觉语言模型根据描述回答问题的准确性来评估描述质量，避免了传统监督微调对人工标注的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的图像描述模型依赖监督微调，需要昂贵的人工标注数据，导致模型记忆特定答案而缺乏泛化能力和创造性。需要一种能生成多样化高质量描述的新方法。

Method: 采用两阶段解耦流程：LVLM生成图像描述，然后由独立的无视觉LLM根据该描述回答多项选择题，用回答准确率作为强化学习的客观奖励信号。

Result: 在CapRL-5M数据集上预训练后，在12个基准测试中取得显著提升；在Prism评估框架中性能接近Qwen2.5-VL-72B，平均超过基线8.4%。

Conclusion: CapRL成功将RLVR应用于主观性图像描述任务，提供了一种不依赖人工标注的可扩展训练方法，显著提升了描述的实用性和质量。

Abstract: Image captioning is a fundamental task that bridges the visual and linguistic
domains, playing a critical role in pre-training Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Current state-of-the-art captioning models are typically trained with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), a paradigm that relies on expensive, non-scalable
data annotated by humans or proprietary models. This approach often leads to
models that memorize specific ground-truth answers, limiting their generality
and ability to generate diverse, creative descriptions. To overcome the
limitation of SFT, we propose applying the Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm to the open-ended task of image captioning.
A primary challenge, however, is designing an objective reward function for the
inherently subjective nature of what constitutes a "good" caption. We introduce
Captioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework that
redefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption should
enable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about the
corresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLM
generates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of a
separate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely on
that caption. As the first study to apply RLVR to the subjective image
captioning task, we demonstrate that CapRL significantly enhances multiple
settings. Pretraining on the CapRL-5M caption dataset annotated by CapRL-3B
results in substantial gains across 12 benchmarks. Moreover, within the Prism
Framework for caption quality evaluation, CapRL achieves performance comparable
to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, while exceeding the baseline by an average margin of 8.4%.

Abstract: Most existing approaches to referring segmentation achieve strong performance
only through fine-tuning or by composing multiple pre-trained models, often at
the cost of additional training and architectural modifications. Meanwhile,
large-scale generative diffusion models encode rich semantic information,
making them attractive as general-purpose feature extractors. In this work, we
introduce a new method that directly exploits features, attention scores, from
diffusion transformers for downstream tasks, requiring neither architectural
modifications nor additional training. To systematically evaluate these
features, we extend benchmarks with vision-language grounding tasks spanning
both images and videos. Our key insight is that stop words act as attention
magnets: they accumulate surplus attention and can be filtered to reduce noise.
Moreover, we identify global attention sinks (GAS) emerging in deeper layers
and show that they can be safely suppressed or redirected onto auxiliary
tokens, leading to sharper and more accurate grounding maps. We further propose
an attention redistribution strategy, where appended stop words partition
background activations into smaller clusters, yielding sharper and more
localized heatmaps. Building on these findings, we develop RefAM, a simple
training-free grounding framework that combines cross-attention maps, GAS
handling, and redistribution. Across zero-shot referring image and video
segmentation benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms prior methods,
establishing a new state of the art without fine-tuning or additional
components.
