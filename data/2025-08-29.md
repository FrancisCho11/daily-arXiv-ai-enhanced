### [1] [Mitigating Hallucinations in Multimodal LLMs via Object-aware Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20181)
*Alberto Compagnoni,Davide Caffagni,Nicholas Moratelli,Lorenzo Baraldi,Marcella Cornia,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CHAIR-DPO方法，利用CHAIR指标构建偏好数据，通过直接偏好优化减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)在视觉输入中产生幻觉内容的问题，将其视为对齐问题来处理

Method: 使用CHAIR指标区分幻觉和非幻觉样本，构建偏好数据对，通过直接偏好优化(DPO)微调现成的MLLMs

Result: 在多个幻觉基准测试中有效减少了幻觉答案的数量，证明了基于CHAIR奖励微调的有效性

Conclusion: CHAIR-DPO方法提供了一种简单有效的解决方案，无需复杂的数据构建流程或依赖专有模型，就能显著降低MLLMs的幻觉问题

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to
address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite
showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue
is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the
user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we
address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer
the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In
contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build
synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary
models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to
gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of
generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options
(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf
MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we
refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated
answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models
are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

### [2] [SDiFL: Stable Diffusion-Driven Framework for Image Forgery Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20182)
*Yang Su,Shunquan Tan,Jiwu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于Stable Diffusion的多模态架构，提出了一种无需大量标注数据的图像伪造定位新方法，通过将伪造残差作为显式模态融入潜在空间，显著提升了伪造检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像伪造定位方法严重依赖人工标注数据，难以跟上多模态大模型驱动的图像篡改技术发展速度，需要更高效准确的解决方案。

Method: 利用Stable Diffusion V3的多模态处理能力，将图像伪造残差（通过高通滤波器提取的高频信号）作为显式模态，在潜在空间中进行融合训练，同时保留SD3提取的丰富语义信息。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准数据集上比当前最先进的图像伪造定位模型性能提升高达12%，在训练中未见过的真实文档伪造图像和自然场景伪造图像上也表现出强大性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将SD的多模态生成和感知能力整合到图像取证框架中，实现了更高效准确的伪造定位，为应对新兴图像篡改技术提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable
Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing
significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery
localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly
annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image
manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to
integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into
an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery
localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of
SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to
inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this
foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable
DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the
multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating
image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific
highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the
latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.
Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,
thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in
performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current
state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model
demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document
forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were
entirely unseen during training.

### [3] [Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models with Quantitative Skin Attributes: A Retrieval Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20188)
*Max Torop,Masih Eskandar,Nicholas Kurtansky,Jinyang Liu,Jochen Weber,Octavia Camps,Veronica Rotemberg,Jennifer Dy,Kivanc Kose*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究探索结合多模态大语言模型和定量属性来提高皮肤疾病AI诊断的可解释性，通过微调使模型能够从图像预测病变属性值，并在SLICE-3D数据集上验证了嵌入空间与属性的关联性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然AI模型在皮肤疾病诊断方面表现出色，但其预测的可解释性仍需大幅提升才能实际应用。研究旨在通过结合MLLMs和定量属性两种方法来解决这一挑战。

Method: 采用多模态大语言模型，通过微调使其能够从皮肤病变图像预测定量属性值（如病变面积等），并在SLICE-3D数据集上进行基于属性的图像检索案例研究来验证嵌入空间的属性关联性。

Result: 研究表明MLLM嵌入空间可以与病变外观相关的定量属性建立关联，通过微调可以实现从图像预测这些属性值，为模型预测提供了更好的解释基础。

Conclusion: 结合多模态大语言模型和定量属性的方法为提高皮肤疾病AI诊断模型的可解释性提供了有前景的途径，使模型预测能够基于可量化的病变特征进行解释。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in
diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist
clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model
predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice.
To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a
potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for
diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a
number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,
lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high
accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the
potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM
embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to
predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the
embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval
case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

### [4] [Enhancing Automatic Modulation Recognition With a Reconstruction-Driven Vision Transformer Under Limited Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20193)
*Hossein Ahmadi,Banafsheh Saffari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于Vision Transformer的统一框架，整合监督、自监督和重建目标，在低标签条件下实现自动调制识别的优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动调制识别方法依赖大量标注数据或多阶段训练流程，限制了实际应用中的可扩展性和泛化能力

Method: 使用ViT编码器、轻量卷积解码器和线性分类器的统一框架，通过重建分支将增强信号映射回原始信号，在预训练中学习鲁棒特征，微调时使用部分标签监督

Result: 在RML2018.01A数据集上，低标签条件下优于监督CNN和ViT基线，仅用15-20%标注数据即可达到ResNet水平精度，在不同SNR级别下保持强劲性能

Conclusion: 该框架为自动调制识别提供了简单、通用且标签高效的解决方案

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,
spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing
solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training
pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a
unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,
self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT
encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the
reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring
the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,
discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label
supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited
labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and
ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only
15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR
levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and
label-efficient solution for AMR.

### [5] [InfinityHuman: Towards Long-Term Audio-Driven Human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20210)
*Xiaodi Li,Pan Xie,Yi Ren,Qijun Gan,Chen Zhang,Fangyuan Kong,Xiang Yin,Bingyue Peng,Zehuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfinityHuman是一个从粗到细的音频驱动人体动画框架，通过姿态引导的细化器和手部特定奖励机制，解决了现有方法中的身份漂移、颜色偏移和手部运动失真问题，实现了高质量、长时长的视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的音频驱动人体动画方法在生成高分辨率、长时长视频时存在身份漂移、颜色偏移、场景不稳定以及手部运动建模不佳的问题，导致视频质量下降和音频不同步。

Method: 提出coarse-to-fine框架：首先生成音频同步表示，然后使用姿态引导的细化器逐步细化为高分辨率视频；利用解耦的姿态序列和初始帧作为视觉锚点减少漂移；引入基于高质量手部运动数据训练的手部特定奖励机制。

Result: 在EMTD和HDTF数据集上的实验表明，InfinityHuman在视频质量、身份保持、手部准确性和唇部同步方面达到了最先进的性能。消融研究证实了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: InfinityHuman通过稳定的姿态引导和手部奖励机制，成功解决了音频驱动人体动画中的关键挑战，能够生成高质量、长时间、身份一致且手势自然的视频内容。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its
practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating
high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural
hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames
but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,
and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,
resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this
work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates
audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into
high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose
sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our
pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual
anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance
semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward
mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD
and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation
studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made
public.

### [6] [Spherical Vision Transformers for Audio-Visual Saliency Prediction in 360-Degree Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20221)
*Mert Cokelek,Halit Ozsoy,Nevrez Imamoglu,Cagri Ozcinar,Inci Ayhan,Erkut Erdem,Aykut Erdem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了两个新颖的360度视频显著性预测模型SalViT360和SalViT360-AV，并创建了YT360-EyeTracking数据集，通过结合空间音频和视觉线索显著提升了全景视频中的注意力预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对360度环境中球形畸变和空间音频整合的复杂性，以及缺乏全面的360度视听显著性预测数据集的问题，研究旨在探索如何利用视听线索有效预测360度视频中的视觉显著性。

Method: 创建了包含81个ODV的YT360-EyeTracking数据集，提出了基于视觉变换器的SalViT360框架（具有球形几何感知的时空注意力层）和SalViT360-AV模型（进一步整合了基于音频输入的变换器适配器）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集（包括YT360-EyeTracking）上的实验结果表明，SalViT360和SalViT360-AV在预测360度场景中观众注意力方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，在模型架构中整合空间音频线索对于准确预测全景视频中的显著性至关重要，这为360度视频的显著性预测提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual
reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study
extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,
addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of
spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a
spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's
perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive
datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates
YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying
audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual
cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this
aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a
vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical
geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which
further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our
results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,
demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing
methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these
results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model
architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional
videos. Code and dataset will be available at
https://cyberiada.github.io/SalViT360.

### [7] [A Novel Framework for Automated Explain Vision Model Using Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20227)
*Phu-Vinh Nguyen,Tan-Hanh Pham,Chris Ngo,Truong Son Hy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于视觉-语言模型的管线方法，用于解释视觉模型在样本层面和数据集层面的行为，可以轻松发现模型的失败案例和偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型开发主要关注性能指标（如准确率、IoU、mAP），而很少关注可解释性。现有xAI方法多为样本级别解释，缺乏能够解释模型在大规模数据集上一般性行为的方法。

Method: 利用视觉-语言模型构建一种管线方法，能够同时提供样本级别和数据集级别的解释，进行视觉模型行为分析。

Result: 该方法可以以最小化的努力发现视觉模型的失败案例，获得模型趋势和模式的洞察，帮助识别模型偏差。

Conclusion: 该管线方法将视觉模型开发与xAI分析相结合，推动了图像分析领域的可解释性研究。

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their
performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention
to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a
meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods
aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general
behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large
dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of
vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased
judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the
application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to
explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed
pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision
models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with
xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对农业资源受限环境开发轻量级CNN模型，解决传统知识蒸馏方法在复杂农业场景下效果有限的问题。

Method: 结合自适应温度调度和混合样本增强的知识蒸馏框架，使用MobileNetV3 Large作为教师模型，训练三种不同规模的残差CNN学生模型。

Result: 所有学生模型验证准确率超过96.7%，紧凑模型达到97.11%准确率，比次优方法提升1.60个百分点，推理延迟仅72.19ms，知识保留率超过99%。

Conclusion: ATMS-KD框架在农业计算机视觉应用中表现出色，能够有效进行知识转移，适用于资源受限的农业环境。

Abstract: This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge
Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable
for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines
adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer
knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to
lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated:
Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M
parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa
damascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis,
southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer
vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental
evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated
significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models
achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to
95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established
knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact
model -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach
while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge
retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective
knowledge transfer regardless of student model capacity.

### [9] [Linking heterogeneous microstructure informatics with expert characterization knowledge through customized and hybrid vision-language representations for industrial qualification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20243)
*Mutahar Safdar,Gentry Wood,Max Zimmermann,Guy Lamouche,Priti Wanjara,Yaoyao Fiona Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这项研究提出了一种新的混合视觉-语言表征框架，通过结合深度语义分割和预训练多模态模型，实现异构材料微观结构的零样本分类认别，提高材料质量评估的效率和可追溯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业制造中高级材料迅速可靠质量评估的瓶颈问题，特别是对于非传统增材制造过程产生的异构结构材料的质量控制需求。

Method: 结合深度语义分割和预训练多模态模型（CLIP和FLAVA），开发了一种基于专家注释的定制化相似性表征方法，包含正向和负向参考标准，通过网状相似性计分实现零样本分类。采用Z分数正规化来调整单模态和交叉模态相似性得分。

Result: 在增材制造的金属基复合材料数据集上验证，框架能够区分合格和缺陷样品。FLAVA模型显示更高的视觉敏感性，CLIP模型在文本标准对齐方面更为一致。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了质量评估流程的可追溯性和可解释性，支持人在循环决策而无需任务特定模型重新训练，为工程信息学领域提供了可扩展和领域适应性质量策略。

Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck
in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced
via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a
novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert
characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language
representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with
pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual
microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared
representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we
develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both
positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their
associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of
previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.
Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset
demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and
defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative
analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the
CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score
normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on
their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and
classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method
enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by
enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model
retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert
knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable
qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

### [10] [MedNet-PVS: A MedNeXt-Based Deep Learning Model for Automated Segmentation of Perivascular Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20256)
*Zhen Xuen Brandon Low,Rory Zhang,Hang Min,William Pham,Lucy Vivash,Jasmine Moses,Miranda Lynch,Karina Dorfman,Cassandra Marotta,Shaun Koh,Jacob Bunyamin,Ella Rowsthorn,Alex Jarema,Himashi Peiris,Zhaolin Chen,Sandy R. Shultz,David K. Wright,Dexiao Kong,Sharon L. Naismith,Terence J. O'Brien,Ying Xia,Meng Law,Benjamin Sinclair*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于MedNeXt-L-k5模型的自动化轮空间分割方法，在T2加权MRI数据集上达到了预计的间评者可靠性水平，但在异质性T1加权数据集上性能有所下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动分割轮空间耗时且可靠性中等，现有自动化深度学习模型性能中等且稿性一般化能力有限。需要开发更高效、更准确的自动化轮空间分割方法。

Method: 采用Transformer受启发的3D编码器-解码器卷积网络MedNeXt-L-k5进行自动化PVS分割。训练了两个模型：一个使用同质性的HCP-Aging T2加权MRI数据，另一个使用来自6台扫描仪的7个研究的40个异质性T1加权MRI数据。通过5折交叉验证和留一地点交叉验证评估模型性能。

Result: 在HCP-Aging T2加权数据集上，模型达到了像素级Dice得分0.88±0.06（白质），相当于该数据集的间评者可靠性水平。在T1加权数据集上性能明显下降（Dice 0.58±0.09）。在异质性数据集上的稿性性能为像素级Dice 0.38±0.16（白质）和0.35±0.12（基底节）。

Conclusion: MedNeXt-L-k5提供了一种高效的自动化PVS分割方案，特别是在T2加权MRI数据上表现优异。但是，该模型并未超过nnU-Net，表明Transformer模型中的注意力机制对于PVS分割任务的高精度并非必需。

Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers
of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and
aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is
time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing
automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to
generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted
MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,
for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a
homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human
Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous
T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model
performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and
leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on
the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of
0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater
reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature.
The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a
substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had
voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and
cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG).
MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation
across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the
nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in
transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high
accuracy in PVS segmentation.

### [11] [Plug-in Feedback Self-adaptive Attention in CLIP for Training-free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20265)
*Zhixiang Chi,Yanan Wu,Li Gu,Huan Liu,Ziqiang Wang,Yang Zhang,Yang Wang,Konstantinos N. Plataniotis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种无需训练的反馈驱动自适应框架，通过将输出层的片形对应关系适应到中间注意力机制，解决CLIP在开放词汇分割任务中的定位问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP虽然具有强大的视觉-文本对齐能力，但在开放词汇分割任务中遇到定位困难。之前的方法通过修改中间注意力来增强空间一致性，但这种一致性因后续操作而无法传播到最终输出，且中间注意力缺乏与文本表征的直接交互。

Method: 提出了一种基于反馈的自适应框架，将输出层的片形对应关系适应回中间注意力机制。设计了注意力隔离、基于信心度的剪枝和适应集成等关键模块。该方法作为插件模块无缝集成到现有方法中。

Result: 在4种最先进方法和3种背榜（ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H）上都实现了一致性性能提升，并在多种注意力类型和8个测试标准上验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将最终预测作为更强的空间一致性先验知识，有效地增强了内部表征与最终预测之间的语义一致性，为解决CLIP在开放词汇分割任务中的定位问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with
open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance
spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence
isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations
such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct
interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the
full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive
framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the
intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the
model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual
semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between
internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's
outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including
attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and
adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our
method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four
state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We
further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self,
and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently
improves their performance across eight benchmarks.

### [12] [How Multimodal LLMs Solve Image Tasks: A Lens on Visual Grounding, Task Reasoning, and Answer Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20279)
*Zhuoran Yu,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个探测框架来系统分析多模态大语言模型在不同层处理视觉和文本输入的动态过程，发现模型存在一致的阶段性结构：早期层进行视觉接地，中间层支持词汇整合和语义推理，最终层准备任务特定输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但其内部处理机制尚未得到充分探索，需要系统分析模型如何在不同层处理多模态信息。

Method: 训练线性分类器从各层token嵌入中预测细粒度视觉类别，使用标准化锚点问题，并在三种提示变体下评估：词汇变体、语义否定变体和输出格式变体。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5、LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3和Qwen2-VL模型中发现一致的阶段性结构，整体结构在不同视觉分词化、指令调优数据和预训练语料下保持稳定，但具体层分配随基础LLM架构变化而显著调整。

Conclusion: 该研究为MLLMs的层级组织提供了统一视角，并提供了轻量级、模型无关的方法来分析多模态表示动态。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing
dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework
to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across
layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories
(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a
standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different
layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt
variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level
changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by
modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that
preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent
stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle
layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers
prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall
stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,
instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation
to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our
findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs
and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal
representation dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出SLiCS方法，通过监督字典学习将视觉-语言联合嵌入空间分解为多个概念特定的线性子空间，实现更精确的概念过滤图像检索和条件生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 假设CLIP等视觉-语言联合嵌入空间可以解耦，将复杂场景的内容信息分解到不同子空间中，每个子空间对应特定概念。

Method: 使用监督字典学习方法估计线性合成模型，通过稀疏非负组合和分组向量字典，采用新颖的交替优化算法保证收敛。利用文本嵌入进行语义描述和零样本分类。

Result: SLiCS提供的解耦嵌入在概念过滤图像检索和条件生成方面表现更精确，在TiTok压缩嵌入和DINOv2自监督嵌入上也取得良好效果。

Conclusion: 稀疏线性概念子空间方法能有效解耦嵌入空间，提升概念级别图像检索和生成任务的精度，适用于多种嵌入表示。

Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent
embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks.
We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the
information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into
multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We
propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear
synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of
vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the
multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative
combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is
optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence.
Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful
descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated
by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit
zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of
concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the
disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS)
enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using
image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed
autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised
DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision
of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

TL;DR: MedFoundationHub是一个GUI工具包，旨在安全部署医疗视觉语言模型，解决PHI泄露等安全风险，支持医生无编程使用和工程师快速部署，通过Docker确保隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗视觉语言模型在临床应用中存在严重的安全隐患，特别是受保护健康信息(PHI)泄露、数据泄漏和网络威胁风险，需要安全可靠的部署方案。

Method: 开发图形用户界面工具包MedFoundationHub，支持医生手动选择模型无需编程，工程师可即插即用部署Hugging Face开源模型，通过Docker编排实现操作系统无关的隐私保护推理。

Result: 使用单个NVIDIA A6000 GPU的离线工作站部署了5个最先进VLM模型，病理学家评估了1015个临床-模型评分事件，发现模型存在离题回答、模糊推理和病理术语不一致等局限性。

Conclusion: MedFoundationHub提供了一个安全、易用的医疗VLM部署解决方案，但当前模型仍存在显著局限性，需要进一步改进以确保临床应用的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable
opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation,
copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their
promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks
of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability
to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even
when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations
must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we
present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1)
enables physicians to manually select and use different models without
programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical
VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face
open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through
Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub
requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000
GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of
academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged
board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs
(Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and
LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases,
yielding 1015 clinician-model scoring events. These assessments revealed
recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and
inconsistent pathology terminology.

Conclusion: BIM模型通过创新的扫描机制有效解决了多任务密集预测中的交互-效率权衡问题，实现了更好的性能表现

Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense
prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational
complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction
completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this
work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel
scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense
prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction
Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as
bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and
position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture,
BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other
hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve
multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse
granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task
feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks,
\emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its
state-of-the-art competitors.

Method: 利用预训练的多模态编码器，通过消除音频编码空间与变分模型提示编码空间之间的差异，并采用分离噪声分支和适应性片选择来处理多模态编辑提示。

Result: 在多样化编辑任务上的综合实验表明，该框架能够通过融合音频的丰富信息来处理复杂编辑场景，而仅依靠文本的方法则无法完成。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种无需训练的音频导航视觉编辑方案，能够有效处理复杂的多模态编辑需求，充分利用音频信息来补充纯文本指导的不足。

Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often
struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not
adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing
prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing
framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio
prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual
editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio
with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage
a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and
integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the
discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt
encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex
scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate
noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on
diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling
complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio,
where text-only approaches fail.

Conclusion: 该研究有效解决了单正多标签学习中的噪声问题，通过创新的损失函数和伪标签技术，为部分注释数据的多标签学习提供了高效的解决方案

Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires
assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating
large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort,
motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme
case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided
with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated.
Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend
to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various
pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these
challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a
novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while
mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective
Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these
contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling
(AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ANN-SNN转换方法在分类任务中表现优异，但在视觉检测任务中性能仍然不理想，主要原因是异质脉冲模式导致的残余膜电位问题。

Method: 采用延迟脉冲方法缓解异质脉冲模式问题，并提出新型时间依赖积分发放(tdIF)神经元架构，使IF神经元能够根据时间步长的时序动态调整积累和发放行为。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法使脉冲能够表现出不同的时间特性，而不仅仅依赖基于频率的表示，在更低的时间步长下实现了更精确的特征表示，同时保持了与传统IF神经元相当的能量消耗。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by
minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic
hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks.
Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in
classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual
detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike
approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by
heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel
temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This
enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their
accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps.
Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than
relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron
maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate
that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower
time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection
tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across
two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN
conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low
latency (within 5 time-steps).

TL;DR: 提出DUP-MCRNet网络，通过动态不确定性传播和多模态协同推理解决显著目标检测中的细节丢失、边缘模糊和模态信息融合不足问题，在多个基准数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有显著目标检测方法在复杂场景中容易丢失细节、模糊边缘，且单模态信息融合不足，需要提升对小结构、边缘区域以及遮挡、弱纹理等复杂情况的检测能力。

Method: 设计动态不确定性图卷积模块(DUGC)通过空间语义距离构建稀疏图进行层间不确定性传播；提出多模态协同融合策略(MCF)使用可学习模态门控权重融合RGB、深度和边缘特征的注意力图；采用多尺度BCE和IoU损失、跨尺度一致性约束和不确定性引导监督机制优化检测性能。

Conclusion: DUP-MCRNet通过动态不确定性传播和多模态协同推理有效提升了显著目标检测的精度和鲁棒性，特别是在处理复杂场景和小结构方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods
are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of
single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic
uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network
(DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is
designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph
constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel
adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small
structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion
strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to
weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can
dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different
scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and
strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between
cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions
under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the
detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through
multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and
uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that
DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets,
especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/YukiBear426/DUP-MCRNet.

Conclusion: 通过多尺度图像特征生成多尺度BEV特征的方法有效解决了多视角行人检测中的尺度变化问题，大幅提升了检测精度

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end
trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often
struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views
or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not
exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect
pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called
Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV
features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual
views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits
the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.
Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with
consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information
at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV
features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of
pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV
features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the
previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques,
forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across
applications like video conferencing and social media. Although
state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their
heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical
applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware
Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture
for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware
module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through
a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A
token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature
interaction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key
semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency,
with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In
real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by
computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their
practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve
comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational
efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection
strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a
large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is
applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial
weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost,
followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to
retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on
publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans,
and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance
and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet
high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead.
Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or
voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme
sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby
limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we
propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our
framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry
Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features
at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.
This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while
maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature
Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to
guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information
sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and
providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By
integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature
representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the
coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art
compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both
encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization. Code is available at

Conclusion: 视频中的常识先验知识显著促进了3D创作，为3D生成提供了新的解决方案，所有资源均已开源。

Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained
models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,
this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it
available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.
Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense
priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the
generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,
videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial
consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic
information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be
more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper
explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning
datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video
dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative
model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to
produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in
contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential
for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense
priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have
open-sourced all resources including the dataset, code, technical framework,

Abstract: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving
systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous.
Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for
generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting
or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited
visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose
G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing
in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the
edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure
accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box
layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects.
Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we
incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during
generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor
effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a
unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability
and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胎儿脑部精确分割对评估神经发育至关重要，但胰体育胸发育不良(CCD)等稀有疾病导致注释数据极少，限制了深度学习模型的普遍化能力

Method: 提出疾病知识领域随机化策略，将CCD表现的先验知识嵌入合成数据生成流程中，仅使用健康数据模拟多样化的脑部改变

Result: 在248例健康胎儿、26例CCD和47例其他脑部疾病的期前数据集上验证，CCD案例分割性能显著提升，LCC估计误差从10.9mm降至0.7mm，同时保持对其他病理情况的性能

Conclusion: 将领域特定的解剖先验知识集成到合成数据流程中，可有效缓解数据稀缺问题，为稀有但临床重要的变形提供更可靠的分析方法

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and
assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum
dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the
rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of
deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain
randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a
synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations
from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without
requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with
CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on
CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with
other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically
relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show
their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed
augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in
healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these
quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological
consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable
shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating
domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively
mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant
malformations.

TL;DR: 首个统一框架，能够处理手语、唇部动作和音频组合，用于生成口语文本。在SLT、VSR、ASR和AVSR任务上达到或超过专门模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的语音识别系统对聋听障碍人士不可用，而手语和唇读等视觉方案通常单独研究，缺乏统一框架来整合这些多模态。

Method: 设计了一个统一的、模态无关的架构，能够有效处理异构输入。重点研究手语、唇部动作和音频之间的协同作用，尤其是唇部动作在手语理解中的作用。

Result: 在SLT、VSR、ASR和AVSR任务上达到了与专门模型相当或更优的性能。明确将唇部动作建模为独立模态显著提高了SLT的性能。

Conclusion: 该统一框架成功整合了多模态输入，为聋听障碍人士提供了更好的通信解决方案，并且证明了多模态协同学习的价值。

Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the
success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such
systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer
effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT)
and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication.
Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their
integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations
of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation.
We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic
architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii)
exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of
lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii)
achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models
specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve
performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models
across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves
SLT performance.

TL;DR: Video-MTR是一个强化多轮推理框架，通过迭代选择关键视频片段和问题理解来解决长视频理解问题，无需外部视觉语言模型，实现了端到端训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解存在长时序依赖和多事件的挑战，现有方法依赖静态推理或外部视觉语言模型，存在复杂度高和性能次优的问题。

Method: 提出多轮推理框架，逐步选择视频片段并基于先前处理片段的理解进行迭代推理，引入门控双层次奖励系统优化视频片段选择和问题理解。

Result: 在VideoMME、MLVU和EgoSchema等基准测试中，Video-MTR在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Video-MTR通过迭代多轮推理和端到端训练，显著提升了长视频理解的性能，为相关领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal
dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often
rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face
issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of
end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced
multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment
selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning
pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs
reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on
the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current
question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually
aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we
introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level
rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing
frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and
question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing
end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,
and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video
understanding.

TL;DR: DUO是一个针对单目3D目标检测的测试时自适应框架，通过联合优化语义不确定性和几何不确定性，在域偏移场景下显著提升检测性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法虽然认识到低不确定性与高泛化能力的正相关性，但未能解决单目3D目标检测中固有的双重不确定性（语义不确定性和几何不确定性）问题。

Method: 提出双不确定性优化（DUO）框架，包括：1）通过凸优化视角创新性地推导出无监督版本的focal loss，实现标签无关的不确定性加权；2）设计语义感知的法向量场约束，在语义清晰区域保持几何一致性；3）建立语义和几何分支的互补循环优化机制。

Result: 在多个数据集和不同域偏移类型上的广泛实验表明，DUO方法优于现有方法，表现出卓越的性能。

Conclusion: DUO是首个专门针对单目3D目标检测双重不确定性问题的测试时自适应框架，通过联合优化语义和几何不确定性，显著提升了在域偏移条件下的检测鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates
significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor
variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have
emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.
While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low
uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual
uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class
predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To
bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA
framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.
Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure
of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling
label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty
objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that
preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing
uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism
forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic
classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial
understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over
existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers'
shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively
established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory,
limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing
improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which
includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot.
CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it
into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore,
based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence
a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through
swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of
CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In
particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and
verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively
consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer
new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业制造中表面异常检测至关重要，3D点云方法虽有丰富几何线索但缺乏强大预训练基础模型，需要结合2D预训练优势来解决此问题

Method: 提出重要性感知集成网络(IAENet)，通过重要性感知融合(IAF)模块动态评估每个数据源的贡献度并重新加权异常分数，设计专门损失函数优化IAF模块

Result: 在MVTec 3D-AD数据集上进行大规模实验，IAENet达到了新的state-of-the-art结果，并显著降低了假阻性率

Conclusion: IAENet通过有效融合2D和3D模态的优势，为工业表面异常检测提供了实用价值高的解决方案

Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in
industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable
success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its
richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of
powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To
bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an
ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.
However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:
existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus
degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel
Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution
of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise
critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling
it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve
their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet
achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate,
underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成中语义图像编辑的挑战，现有方法存在重建误差和数据集质量限制的问题。

Method: 提出Cross-Attentive UNet架构，通过注意力桥接机制将参考图像特征注入到提示到编辑图像的生成过程中，无需架构修改或反转。

Conclusion: 该方法克服了指令数据集质量的限制，具有更好的可扩展性和生成能力，为语义图像编辑提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing
remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce
reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from
limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a
descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core
idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based
text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained
Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.
Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a
Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference
image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its
text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction
dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other
extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it
improves editing accuracy and consistency.

TL;DR: DCFS是一个新颖的持续测试时适应框架，通过双路径特征一致性和置信度感知样本学习来解决伪标签质量问题和误差累积问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无法访问源域数据的情况下，现有方法依赖模型预测生成伪标签，但伪标签质量无法保证且存在误差累积问题，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 使用双分类器将目标数据的特征表示解耦为语义相关特征和域相关特征，通过保持子特征与整体特征的一致性来多角度捕获数据特征，并设置自适应阈值进行置信度加权自监督学习。

Result: 在CIFAR10-C、CIFAR100-C和ImageNet-C等多个数据集上的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性，在持续测试时适应场景中表现出稳定的性能。

Conclusion: DCFS框架通过特征解耦和一致性约束，结合置信度感知学习，有效解决了持续测试时适应中的伪标签噪声和误差累积问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model
to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access
to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics
of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion
and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate
pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels
cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To
address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that
introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.
This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data
into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers
to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between
the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture
data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the
whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we
set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to
carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the
noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The
efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation
across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C,
demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation
scenarios.

Motivation: 相机标定质量对新视角合成致关重要，1像素错误就会对重建质量产生显著影响，而实际场景缺乏真实标定数据

Method: 使用3DGS模型，通过背向传播新视角色彩损失来对相机参数进行细调优化

Result: 在标准数据集上实现了平均0.4 dB PSNR的提升，显著改善了新视角合成质量

Conclusion: 虽然细调过程可能耗时较长，但对于重要场景的标定（如Mip-NeRF 360），新视角质量的提升价值远超过训练时间成本

Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating
progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a
significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground
truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the
quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to
fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect
to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average
improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine
tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training
time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake
of novel view quality is the most important.

Abstract: Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is
critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising
results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for
labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting
high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous
active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by
selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such
one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source
medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal
medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and
sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection
in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the
most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.
Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks
demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods. Code is available at

Conclusion: 通过数据层面的早期融合和双向信息传递，结合强大的视觉基础模型和噪声消除技术，能够有效提升无监督3D检测的性能。

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated
labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining
high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this
issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB
images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these
methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB
images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to
the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms
of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at
an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance
segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional
fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,
while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To
mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and
global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth
estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove
segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion
based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes
under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector
trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous
state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation
benchmark.

Abstract: Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning
models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable
or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer
vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this
study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our
WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from
25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses
posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing
low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views.
This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We
achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test
set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published
literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on
the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable
with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust
generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a
MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the
full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices
using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training,
filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source
contributions.

Conclusion: 研究结果深化了对域适应技术的理解，为模型在医学数据上的有效适应提供了宝贵见解，DSAN算法在医学图像分类中具有重要应用价值

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to
alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging
information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA
have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder
to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets
can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the
benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557
simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image
classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various
scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited
training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful
observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these
techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the
Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved
feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using
Resnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data
stream DA scenario (+6.7\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also
demonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when
evaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets. These results contribute to the
understanding of DA techniques and offer valuable insight into the effective
adaptation of models to medical data.

TL;DR: 提出CLAB方法，通过对比学习辅助分支增强视频目标检测的鲁棒性，无需额外计算开销，在ImageNet VID数据集上达到84.0-85.2% mAP的SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频目标检测面临运动模糊、遮挡等图像退化问题，现有方法通过特征聚合和复杂后处理提升性能但计算成本高，需要在不增加推理计算量的情况下提升鲁棒性

Method: 引入对比学习辅助分支(CLAB)，使用对比损失增强主干网络特征表示能力；提出动态损失加权策略，训练早期侧重辅助特征学习，后期逐渐侧重检测任务

Result: 在ImageNet VID数据集上，ResNet-101达到84.0% mAP，ResNeXt-101达到85.2% mAP，实现CNN模型的SOTA性能，无需额外后处理方法

Conclusion: CLAB方法有效提升了视频目标检测对图像退化的鲁棒性，在保持推理效率的同时实现了显著的性能提升

Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from
image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes,
making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images.
Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing
feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost
of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation
without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch
(CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a
contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video
object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy
that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually
prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach
through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a
performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101,
respectively, on the ImageNet VID dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art
performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing
methods.

### [40] [Towards Mechanistic Defenses Against Typographic Attacks in CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20570)
*Lorenz Hufe,Constantin Venhoff,Maximilian Dreyer,Sebastian Lapuschkin,Wojciech Samek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了CLIP视觉编码器在排版攻击下的行为，发现特定注意力头负责提取排版信息，并提出了一种无需微调的防御方法，通过选择性消融注意力头电路来显著提升模型对排版攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 排版攻击通过向图像中注入文本来操纵多模态系统，导致目标错误分类、恶意内容生成和视觉语言模型越狱。需要研究CLIP模型在这种攻击下的行为并开发有效的防御方法。

Method: 定位CLIP模型后半层中专用于提取和传输排版信息的注意力头，构建排版电路，然后通过选择性消融这些注意力头来防御排版攻击，无需微调。

Result: 该方法在ImageNet-100的排版变体上性能提升高达19.6%，同时标准ImageNet-100准确率下降不到1%。无需训练的防御方法与当前依赖微调的最先进方法竞争力相当。

Conclusion: 发布了一系列抗排版攻击的dyslexic CLIP模型，这些模型可作为安全关键应用的即插即用替代方案，在文本识别效用与文本操纵风险之间提供更好的平衡。

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into
images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation
and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP
vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized
attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract
and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these
insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic
attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention
heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to
19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard
ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach
remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that
rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models
which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models
serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical
applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility
of text recognition.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with
wide range of applications including human computer interaction, surveillance,
and assistive technologies. However, challenges such as occlusion, expression
variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional
FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by
modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured
and interpretable learning. In this paper, we propose GLaRE, a novel
Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial
landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is
constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while
reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet
and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines.
Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings
from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.

Method: 提出FastFit框架，采用半注意力机制，用类别嵌入替代传统时间步嵌入，完全解耦参考特征编码与去噪过程，实现参考特征的单次计算和跨步骤无损复用。

Conclusion: FastFit通过创新的可缓存扩散架构成功解决了多参考虚拟试穿的效率和性能问题，为复杂多参考虚拟试穿研究提供了新的解决方案和数据集支持。

Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from
real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current
methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and
accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant
re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these
challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on
framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a
Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with
class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference
feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.
This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused
across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and
achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to
facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce
DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of
high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms,
dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and
human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode,
and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in
inference efficiency.

Conclusion: UTA-Sign方法有效解决了低光照环境下交通标志感知的挑战，通过多模态融合提升了自动驾驶系统对语义理解的准确性

Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light
conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous
driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges
when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose
safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event
camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven
effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the
complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes
UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage
in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and
roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and
the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting
mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage
representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to
provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven
event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage
content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the
environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage
sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

Conclusion: 提出的主动防御方法通过针对生成过程的低频扰动，有效破坏了深度伪造技术，为对抗深度伪造威胁提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses
significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods
are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing
attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on
low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation,
reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior
approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification
accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake
techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen
defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while
preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually
plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an
encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations
that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW
demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved
defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

Conclusion: 通过显式建模不确定性和引入随机采样，Diverse-T2M方法成功解决了文本到动作生成中的多样性挑战，实现了高质量和多样化的动作生成。

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The
key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving
generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation
of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the
generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to
overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion
generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces
uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly
diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text.
Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as
carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a
explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where
text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid
one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce
stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the
diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion
generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art
performance in text consistency.

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in
liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical
structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is
crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS)
offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ,
which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT)
scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an
optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate
3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise
alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving
intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver
images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration
error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT
scan. Our method provides a reliable and accurate means of calibration and
volume reconstruction. It can be used to register intraoperative ultrasound
images with preoperative CT images in the context of liver surgery, and enhance
intraoperative guidance.

Conclusion: PI-GenMFI方法能有效生成高质量的合成MFI数据，为机器学习算法提供训练数据，优化半导体缺陷定位过程

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are
critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a
reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and
time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a
more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray
scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary
concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML)
models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach
leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics
Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate
synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate
MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic
images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize
defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to
SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion
methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples.
In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various
metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising
results to optimize the defect localization process.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的GAN-PFO框架能够有效攻击分开推理系统，显著提高了数据重构质量，对深度神经网络的隐私保护构成了严重威胁

Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption
of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation
between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy.
However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that
intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive
input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically
effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors,
limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and
model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework
with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator
into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations
to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the
optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint
during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios,
out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.

Abstract: Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos
with vivid expressions. Existing methods still exhibit limitations in control
flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently
available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further
exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially
hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key
modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling,
emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive
module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To
improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive
audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and
driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial
motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset
with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's
performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware
sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that
further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and
achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves
state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive,

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the
reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by
representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly
constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and
reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of
reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a
novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and
consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head
regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the
Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy
(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize
identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal
inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric
alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the
later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,
effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive
experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,
photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack
significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving
frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent
visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians,
offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the
process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic
variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging
conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models
perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift
and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,
and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we
investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in
artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings
with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate

*Ayan Banerjee,Fernando Vilariño,Josep Lladós*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CraftGraffiti是一个端到端的文本引导涂鸦生成框架，通过风格优先、身份保持的方法解决极端风格变换中的人脸身份保持问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在涂鸦这种高对比度、抽象的艺术形式中，细微的面部特征扭曲会消除主体的可识别性，破坏个人和文化真实性。需要一种能够在极端风格变换中保持人脸身份的方法。

Method: 使用LoRA微调的预训练扩散变换器进行涂鸦风格迁移，通过面部一致性自注意力机制增强身份嵌入，采用CLIP引导的提示扩展实现无关键点的姿态定制，采用"风格优先、身份保持"的范式。

Result: 定量结果显示具有竞争力的面部特征一致性和最先进的美学评分，在Cruilla Festival的现场部署展示了系统的实际创意影响力。

Conclusion: CraftGraffiti推进了身份尊重的AI辅助艺术目标，为创意AI应用中融合风格自由和可识别性提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a
major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract
medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's
recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We
present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework
designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an
input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first
applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion
transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent
self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity
embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided
prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence.
We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after"
paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order.
Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and
state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative
analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's
real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of
identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for
blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种生成去偏自判断分数的新方法，使大型视觉语言模型能够自主改进多模态对齐，减少幻觉并提高安全性，无需依赖外部资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型对齐方法依赖外部数据集、人工标注或复杂后处理，限制了可扩展性并增加了成本，且容易产生幻觉和安全问题。

Method: 通过生成去偏自判断分数作为内部自评估指标，无需外部资源，增强解码策略和偏好调优过程，实现模型自主对齐改进。

Result: 实证结果显示该方法显著优于传统方法，有效减少幻觉、增强安全性并提升整体能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为对齐大型视觉语言模型提供了更有效的解决方案，具有更好的可扩展性和成本效益。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating
visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these
modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where
generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety
concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as
instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets,
human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and
increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created
internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the
model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding
strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced
hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical
results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods,
offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

TL;DR: S-HArM是一个多模态数据集，用于意图感知分类，包含来自社交媒体平台的图像-文本对，标注为幽默/讽刺、艺术或错误信息。研究探索了三种提示策略生成合成训练数据，发现保留视觉上下文的图像和多模态引导数据在泛化性能上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要忽视了AI生成图像背后的意图，为了填补这一空白，需要开发能够识别内容创作意图的多模态分类方法。

Method: 构建了包含9,576个社交媒体图像-文本对的数据集，探索了三种提示策略（图像引导、描述引导、多模态引导）使用Stable Diffusion生成大规模合成训练数据，并比较了多种模型架构包括模态融合、对比学习、重建网络、注意力机制和大规模视觉语言模型。

Result: 使用图像引导和多模态引导数据训练的模型对真实世界内容具有更好的泛化能力，因为保留了视觉上下文。但整体性能仍然有限。

Conclusion: 推断意图的任务具有复杂性，需要专门的架构来处理，当前方法在意图识别方面仍面临挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic
and out-of-context content. However, existing efforts largely overlook the
intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a
multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the
wild" image-text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit, labeled as Humor/Satire, Art,
or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies
(image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a
large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an
extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning,
reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language
models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided
data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual
context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the
complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.

Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable
a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text
models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot
accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light
architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge
distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient,
scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal
reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles
trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN
dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption
datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of
temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of
caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive
improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We
train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art
ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe
2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with
MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot
accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and
improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our
pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data
generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data
generation code makes it easy to create new reinforced datasets with arbitrary

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经视频压缩中精确码率控制的挑战，满足可变码率场景的需求

Method: 动态路由自编码器（可变编码路由）+ 码率控制代理（实时调整路由）+ 联合路由优化策略（协同训练）

Result: 在HEVC和UVG数据集上平均BD-Rate降低14.8%，BD-PSNR增益0.47dB，平均码率误差仅1.66%

Conclusion: 实现了码率-失真-复杂度优化（RDCO），为各种码率和码率受限应用提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Neural Video Compression (NVC) has achieved remarkable performance in recent
years. However, precise rate control remains a challenge due to the inherent
limitations of learning-based codecs. To solve this issue, we propose a dynamic
video compression framework designed for variable bitrate scenarios. First, to
achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route
Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational
complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off.
Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the
bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To
encompass a broad spectrum of variable bitrates while preserving overall RD
performance, we employ the Joint-Routes Optimization strategy, achieving
collaborative training of various routes. Extensive experiments on the HEVC and
UVG datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average BD-Rate
reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47dB over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining an average bitrate error of 1.66%, achieving
Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) for various bitrate and
bitrate-constrained applications. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心脏运动估计方法依赖基于强度的图像配准相似性损失，往往忽略心脏解剖区域，导致运动捕捉不准确。

Method: 提出循环变分自编码器框架，建模心脏周期的时空依赖性，使用两个后验模型进行双心室分割和运动估计，通过分割图递归配准而非强度相似性损失。

Result: 在UK Biobank数据集上验证显示，CardioMorphNet在心脏运动估计方面优于最先进方法，并产生更低的不确定性值，表明预测置信度更高。

Conclusion: CardioMorphNet通过形状引导的贝叶斯深度学习框架成功解决了心脏运动估计的挑战，为心脏功能评估提供了更准确可靠的工具。

Abstract: Accurate cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
images is vital for assessing cardiac function and detecting its abnormalities.
Existing methods often struggle to capture heart motion accurately because they
rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook
cardiac anatomical regions. To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a
recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided
deformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a
recurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over
the cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and
motion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation
guides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering
segmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity
loss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The
Bayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the
estimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing
warped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates
superior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields
lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region
compared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods,
indicating higher confidence in its predictions.

Method: 采用三阶段方法：(i)在骨干网络早期和中期插入风格扰动增加特征多样性；(ii)使用弱域标签通过辅助对齐损失对齐注意力精炼特征；(iii)通过温度缩放KL散度从EMA教师模型蒸馏来稳定预测

Result: 在MIDOG 2025任务2的初步排行榜上获得平衡准确率0.8762、灵敏度0.8873、特异度0.8651、ROC AUC 0.9499的优异性能

Conclusion: 该方法推理开销可忽略，仅需粗粒度域元数据，提供强大且平衡的性能，是MIDOG 2025挑战的有竞争力方案

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are important histopathological markers yet
remain challenging to identify consistently, particularly under domain shift
stemming from scanner, stain, and acquisition differences. We present a simple
training-time recipe for domain-robust AMF classification in MIDOG 2025 Task 2.
The approach (i) increases feature diversity via style perturbations inserted
at early and mid backbone stages, (ii) aligns attention-refined features across
sites using weak domain labels (Scanner, Origin, Species, Tumor) through an
auxiliary alignment loss, and (iii) stabilizes predictions by distilling from
an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher with temperature-scaled KL
divergence. On the organizer-run preliminary leaderboard for atypical mitosis
classification, our submission attains balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity
of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499. The method incurs
negligible inference-time overhead, relies only on coarse domain metadata, and
delivers strong, balanced performance, positioning it as a competitive
submission for the MIDOG 2025 challenge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于点式奖励模型的T2I生成方法容易受到奖励破解影响，微小分数差异经归一化后被放大，导致模型过度优化琐碎增益而破坏生成稳定性

Method: Pref-GRPO采用成对偏好奖励方法，在每组图像中使用偏好奖励模型进行成对比较，以胜率作为奖励信号，将优化目标从分数最大化转向偏好拟合

Result: 实验表明Pref-GRPO能区分细微图像质量差异，提供更稳定的优势并缓解奖励破解。UniGenBench基准揭示了开源和闭源T2I模型的优缺点

Conclusion: Pref-GRPO方法通过成对偏好奖励机制有效解决了奖励破解问题，UniGenBench为T2I模型提供了更全面的评估框架

Abstract: Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement
learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation.
However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring
generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens
when minimal score differences between images are amplified after
normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to
over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation
process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference
reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score
maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In
Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,
and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,
providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,
existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering
comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a
unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20
subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27
sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our
benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source
T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.

Abstract: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen
scenes without per-scene optimization. In particular, recent advancements
utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters,
enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing
approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent
features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate
geometry with sparse views. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS, a
framework that enhances feature learning by incorporating context-aware,
cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints. Our architecture integrates three
lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion
and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的零样本3D视觉定位方法存在空间推理受限、上下文遗漏和细节退化等问题，需要消除场景特定训练需求以实现真实世界应用。

Method: 首先通过3D语义分割网络生成3D实例提案，通过语义过滤保留相关候选；然后采用提案引导的多视角投影策略，将候选提案投影到真实场景图像序列；最后通过动态调度机制迭代处理序列查询提示，利用VLM的跨模态推理能力识别文本指定对象。

Result: 在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中分别达到55.6%和53.2%的Acc@0.25分数，比之前的零样本方法分别提升了4.0%和5.2%。

Conclusion: SeqVLM推动了3D视觉定位向更大泛化能力和真实世界适用性的发展，代码已开源。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using
natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher
accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for
real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements.
However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited
reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions
or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel
zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with
spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first
generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and
refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant
candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects
these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial
relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point
cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we
implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes
sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to
identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D
benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores
of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%,
respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world
applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/JiawLin/SeqVLM.

Motivation: CLIP模型在军事防御应用中具有零样本分类优势，但其在具有部分遮挡和低信噪比的挑战性军事环境中的鲁棒性尚未充分探索

Method: 使用包含18类军事车辆的自定义数据集，通过归一化曲线下面积(NAUC)评估不同CLIP变体在不同遮挡比例下的性能

Result: 1) Transformer-based CLIP优于CNN模型；2) 细粒度分散遮挡比大块连续遮挡影响更大；3) 线性探测模型在35%遮挡时性能急剧下降；4) 微调骨干网络后性能下降点推迟到60%遮挡

Conclusion: 强调了训练中遮挡特定增强的重要性，需要进一步探索补丁级敏感性和架构韧性，以实现CLIP在现实世界中的部署

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for
defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in
challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP
variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle
classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across
occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP
models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions
degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite
improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around
35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop
occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of
occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further
exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for
real-world deployment of CLIP.

Abstract: Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with
pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin
architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage
mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network
levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant
pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head
Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the
initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its
capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The
model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to
simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the
SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous
methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the
contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip
connections and the use of the Swin Transformer, in improving model
performance.

Abstract: The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered
by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable
of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be
objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique
ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts
like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a
crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple
semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue
that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to
address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of
high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more
aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different
tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We
observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted
to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their
disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help
us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing
the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释性方法存在可靠性问题，LIME方法不一致，CAM方法不考虑所有类别，医疗实践中需要可信赖、可解释的诊断

Method: Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation (GCAPME)，概率化分析所有类别的像素级激活概率图，结合SafeML技术检测误诊

Result: 在ISIC数据集上使用MobileNetV2和Vision Transformers进行评估

Conclusion: 该方法通过统一可视化诊断过程，降低误诊风险，提高诊断可靠性和患者安全

Abstract: Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly
improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic
performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a
challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are
essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with
LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods
failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose
Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses
all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel
level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps
reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML
enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and
patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient
safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and
Vision Transformers.

### [67] [Evaluating Compositional Generalisation in VLMs and Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20783)
*Beth Pearson,Bilal Boulbarss,Michael Wray,Martha Lewis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了扩散分类器在组合泛化能力方面是否优于判别式模型（如CLIP和ViLT），特别是在对象-属性绑定和关系推理任务上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言语义的核心特征是通过已知部分的组合形成新含义，但现有视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在处理组合语义时表现不佳，容易出现概念混淆错误。

Method: 评估三种模型（扩散分类器、CLIP和ViLT）在零样本学习（ZSL）和广义零样本学习（GZSL）设置下的表现，重点关注对象属性绑定和关系推理能力。

Result: 扩散分类器和ViLT在概念绑定任务上表现良好，但所有模型在关系GZSL任务上都面临显著困难，表明VLMs在关系推理方面存在普遍挑战。

Conclusion: CLIP嵌入分析表明，关系概念（如左右）的表示过于相似可能是导致困难的原因，扩散模型在组合泛化方面展现出潜力但仍需改进关系推理能力。

Abstract: A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel
meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years,
however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of
composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a
VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or
a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails
to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained
significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot
classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively
with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the
generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation
abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --
Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with
attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised
zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion
Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models
struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader
challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings
suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of
relational concepts such as left and right. Code and dataset are available at:

Motivation: 现有点云配准方法忽略点方向和不确定性，对噪声和剧烈旋转敏感，需要大量增强训练数据

Method: 使用虚拟视角相机参数从Lidar点云初始化面元，通过SE(3)等变卷积核学习位置和旋转特征，包含等变卷积编码器、交叉注意力机制、全连接解码器和Huber损失

Result: 在室内外数据集上相比最先进方法展现出优越性和鲁棒性能

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理点云配准中的噪声和旋转问题，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of
multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital
heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both
non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point
uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive
rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it
necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations.
To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning
regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud
using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit
$\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation
through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative
transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an
equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity
computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss.
Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model
superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DVCTNet通过双视图协同训练和特征融合，有效提高了牙科龋齿检测的准确性，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role
in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often
yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion
morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow
where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed
tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training
network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing
automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view
from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then
pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The
global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating
region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts
detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the
region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we
introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically
fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the
fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To
rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further
validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries
detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays
for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior
performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets,
indicating the clinical applicability of our method. Our code and labeled
dataset are available at https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.

### [70] [FusionCounting: Robust visible-infrared image fusion guided by crowd counting via multi-task learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20817)
*He Li,Xinyu Liu,Weihang Kong,Xingchen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FusionCounting框架，将人群计数与可见光-红外图像融合相结合，通过多任务学习和动态损失权重策略，在提升图像融合质量的同时实现更好的人群计数性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VIF方法主要关注图像质量优化，语义分割需要大量标注，目标检测在拥挤场景中存在边界框重叠和遮挡问题。RGB-T人群计数虽受关注但尚未与VIF整合，人群计数标注简单且适合密集场景。

Method: 提出多任务学习框架FusionCounting，将人群计数整合到VIF过程中；采用动态损失函数权重策略加速收敛和平衡任务贡献；引入对抗训练增强VIF和人群计数的鲁棒性。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，FusionCounting不仅提升了图像融合质量，还实现了更优越的人群计数性能。

Conclusion: 该框架成功将人群计数与图像融合相结合，通过多任务设计和动态优化策略，在减少标注需求的同时提升了在密集场景中的性能表现。

Abstract: Most visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) methods focus primarily on
optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating
downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to
provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires
extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation
efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes
due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd
counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have
integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these
challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework
that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a
direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation,
making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both
input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial
multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions,
we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and
crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial
attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that
FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves
superior crowd counting performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN和Transformer方法在小型医疗数据集上容易过拟合，需要利用预训练视觉语言模型的泛化能力来解决手术工具关键点估计问题

Method: 使用低秩调整(LoRA)技术微调视觉语言模型，精心设计提示词构建指令调优数据集，将视觉特征与语义关键点描述对齐

Result: 仅需2个epoch微调，适应后的VLM模型性能就超过了基线模型，证明了LoRA在低资源场景下的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了关键点检测性能，还为未来3D手术手和工具姿态估计工作奠定了基础

Abstract: This paper presents a novel pipeline for 2D keypoint estima- tion of surgical
tools by leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine- tuned using a low rank
adjusting (LoRA) technique. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) or Transformer-based approaches, which often suffer from overfitting in
small-scale medical datasets, our method harnesses the generalization
capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. We carefully design prompts to create an
instruction-tuning dataset and use them to align visual features with semantic
keypoint descriptions. Experimental results show that with only two epochs of
fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the
ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only
improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work
in 3D surgical hands and tools pose estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这是首个将RWKV架构应用于点云分类领域通用化的研究，解决了直接应用RWKV时遇到的空间扭曲和跨领域关注偏移问题，通过两个关键模块提升了模型的空间建模能力和跨领域精度。

Conclusion: 该研究成功将RWKV架构应用于点云分类领域通用化，解决了直接应用时的关键问题，为这一领域提供了一种高效且效果优异的新方法。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the
generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen
domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba
architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high
computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an
emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive
fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work
that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that
directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's
fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial
distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local
geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention
in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through
exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization.
To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored
for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and
cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In
particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local
neighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition,
Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate
attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves
state-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.

Conclusion: PathMR展示了在AI驱动病理诊断中提高可解释性的潜力，代码将公开提供。

Abstract: Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved
diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its
clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of
traceable rationale. To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning
architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at
the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By
localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives,
these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for
dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose
PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological
image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR
generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting
cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our
approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly
developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets
demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual
reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and
cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for
improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will
be publicly available in https://github.com/zhangye-zoe/PathMR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺导管腺癌是致死率极高的癌症，五年生存率低于10%，主要原因是晚期检测。需要开发早期检测方法来提高生存率

Method: 使用六种深度学习架构（包括传统CNN和现代ViT）进行分析，最终采用改进的ResNet架构，包含冻结预训练层和类别加权训练，处理医学图像分析中的数据集大小有限和类别不平衡等挑战

Conclusion: 建立了一个强大的自动化PDAC检测流程，可以增强病理学家的能力，并为扩展到其他癌症类型奠定了基础，同时为有限规模医学影像数据集上的深度学习应用提供了宝贵见解

Abstract: Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms
of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late
detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for
early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging:
autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique
patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of
distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology
evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs).
Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant
challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class
imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet
architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training,
achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant
improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for
clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC
detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a
foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed
methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to
limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical
applications.

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying
inputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to
interpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use
counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and
generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful
attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious
correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.
  The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution
(LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions
rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept
Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like
backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that
perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum
learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy
while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.
  The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides
a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying
identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age
affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal
graphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular,
training-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal
sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.
  Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for
interpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative
models, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias
evaluation and mitigation.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception typically relies on modular pipelines that
decompose the task into detection, tracking, and prediction. While
interpretable, these pipelines suffer from error accumulation and limited
inter-task synergy. Unified perception has emerged as a promising paradigm that
integrates these sub-tasks within a shared architecture, potentially improving
robustness, contextual reasoning, and efficiency while retaining interpretable
outputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of unified
perception, introducing a holistic and systemic taxonomy that categorizes
methods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow.
We define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and
systematically review existing methods, their architectures, training
strategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting
future research directions. This work establishes the first comprehensive
framework for understanding and advancing unified perception, consolidates
fragmented efforts, and guides future research toward more robust,
generalizable, and interpretable perception.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a
powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively
transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel
encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense
features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an
encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized
adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial
details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality
reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that
effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted
extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation
datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art
performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging
modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation
accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the
7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the
superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model
provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. The code is available at

Abstract: Mitotic figures (MFs) are relevant biomarkers in tumor grading.
Differentiating atypical MFs (AMFs) from normal MFs (NMFs) remains difficult,
as manual annotation is time-consuming and subjective. In this work an ensemble
of ConvNeXtBase models was trained with AUCMEDI and extend with a rule-based
refinement (RBR) module. On the MIDOG25 preliminary test set, the ensemble
achieved a balanced accuracy of 84.02%. While the RBR increased specificity, it
reduced sensitivity and overall performance. The results show that deep
ensembles perform well for AMF classification. RBR can increase specific
metrics but requires further research.

ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera
centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from
high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and
real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce
network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained
resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of
computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this
challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and
Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human
pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and
biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it
employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it
implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH
on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion
pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it
well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/PARCO-LAB/COMETH.

Conclusion: 该研究通过利用网络数据有效缓解了图像编辑检测的数据缺乏问题，构建的大规模高质量数据集和Web-IML模型显著提升了检测性能，为该领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Images manipulated using image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose
significant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing the
manipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the
main barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe
lack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we
introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily
available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images
from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a
simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.
Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and
accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve
annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out
unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a
large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually
forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than
existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object
Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating
high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a
new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for
the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and
significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world
forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a
striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1
average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at

Abstract: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner
workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such
simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which
are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's
computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine
learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the
distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is
hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present
ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree
Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a
Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in
simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and
efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of
the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also
provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods,
offering a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in
particle physics experiments at CERN. We make the code available at

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式因果推理实现了透明且逻辑一致的推理，CCE可作为跨领域可重用的因果推理引擎

Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle
with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that
entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These
black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on
shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly
decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language
causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human
cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level
video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and
logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal
Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,
and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in
these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a
scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing
datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation
metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art
models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and
generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine
across diverse domains. Project page:

Motivation: 现有视频加速方法存在根本性限制：既不建模视频帧的时间连贯性，也无法为大规模视频模型提供单步蒸馏，导致采样效率低下。

Method: 采用两阶段蒸馏过程：1）稳定性预热机制，稳定对抗蒸馏并优化单步映射质量；2）统一对抗均衡机制，在高斯噪声空间中进行稳定的单步对抗训练；3）条件对抗一致性方法，提高条件帧与生成帧之间的语义和帧一致性。

Result: 在VBench-I2V基准上平均提升7.15%的语义对齐、时间连贯性和帧质量，将预训练模型的延迟从1000秒降低到10秒（100倍加速），同时保持竞争性性能。

Conclusion: POSE成功解决了大规模视频扩散模型的采样效率瓶颈，实现了高质量单步视频生成，为视频生成领域提供了有效的加速解决方案。

Abstract: The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in
sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences.
Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer
from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of
video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models.
To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a
distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video
diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single
step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video
models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial
distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator
from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of
single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified
adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism
that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash
equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step
videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii)
conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic
consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated
frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other
acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment,
temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained
model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining
competitive performance.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are
computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency,
we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated
prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models,
where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We
propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic
similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show
that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach
significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging
UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater
efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales
with prompt sets, and reduces the environmental and financial burden of
large-scale text-to-image generation. Project page:

Abstract: Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of
recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples.
Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data
to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations.
First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which
struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second,
they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is
essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in
handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot
handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent
text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to
better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We
further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages
high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated
samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that
aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby
enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting
datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent
handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource
handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines. Official implementation is available

Conclusion: MMG-Vid通过最大化有限token预算的利用率，在显著提升效率的同时保持了强大的性能表现

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) excel in video understanding, but their
excessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for
real-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by
visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics
and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding
as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel
training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by
Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,
we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then
dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal
gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm
that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby
maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid
can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly
improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original
performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the
prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in
high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose
CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages
instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and
performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and
introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based
Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the
vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens,
forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this
compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing)
introduces action intent into the language model by pruning
instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level
sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support
accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention
(CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional
action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and
real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing
training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold

Result: 实验显示先前检测器在跨模型场景中泛化良好，但在未见伪造技术和数据域上表现不足；Veritas在不同OOD场景中取得显著提升，并能提供透明可信的检测输出。

Conclusion: HydraFake数据集和Veritas检测器有效解决了深度伪造检测中的现实挑战，通过模拟真实世界场景和人类法医推理过程，显著提升了检测性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and
evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing
academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice,
typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing
images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To
mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world
challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake
involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with
rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures,
emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource,
we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake
detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce
pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as
"planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further
propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake
reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset
reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on
cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains.
Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is
capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FakeParts是一种新型的局部深度伪造技术，通过在真实视频中进行细微的空间或时间区域修改，比传统深度伪造更具欺骗性。研究提出了首个大规模基准数据集FakePartsBench，包含2.5万+视频，并显示人类和现有检测模型的准确率下降超过30%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测主要针对完全合成的内容，而局部细微修改的伪造视频更具欺骗性且难以检测，现有方法对此存在严重漏洞。

Method: 提出了FakeParts局部深度伪造技术，创建了包含超过25,000个视频的FakePartsBench基准数据集，提供像素级和帧级操作标注，并通过用户研究和现有检测模型进行综合评估。

Result: 实验表明，FakeParts使人类检测准确率相比传统深度伪造下降超过30%，现有最先进检测模型也出现类似的性能退化。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了当前深度伪造检测方法在局部视频操作方面的紧急漏洞，并为开发更鲁棒的检测方法提供了必要的数据资源。

Abstract: We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle,
localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of
otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial
manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions
and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them
particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in
detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale
benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial
deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level
manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of
detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human
detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar
performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This
work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection
approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods
for partial video manipulations.

TL;DR: 首个数据驱动的多视角3D点踪踪器，使用4个摄像头即可进行精准的3D点踪踪，充分解决了单目踪踪深度歧义和遮挡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单目踪踪器存在深度歧义和遮挡问题，而传统多摄像头方案需要20个以上摄像头且需每序列优化，故需要一种更实用的多视角3D踪踪方案

Method: 使用已知摄像机姿势和多视角深度信息，将多视角特征融合成统一点云，采用k近邻相关和transformer基础更新来预测长程3D对应关系

Result: 在Panoptic Studio和DexYCB两个真实数据集上达到中位轨迹误差分别为3.1cm和2.0cm，支持1-8个摄像头的多种配置和24-150帧的视频长度

Conclusion: 该方法为多视角3D踪踪研究设定了新标准，提供了一种实用的实际应用工具，具有良好的通用性和性能

Abstract: We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to
track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike
existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and
occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and
tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D
correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling
robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either
sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view
features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation
alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D
correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view
Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and
DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively.
Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying
vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker
alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for
multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world
applications. Project page available at https://ethz-vlg.github.io/mvtracker.

TL;DR: OneReward是一个统一的强化学习框架，使用单一奖励模型提升多任务生成能力，在图像编辑任务中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多任务生成方法通常需要针对特定任务进行监督微调(SFT)，这限制了泛化能力和训练效率。不同任务虽然共享相同的条件范式，但在数据分布和评估指标上差异很大

Method: 使用单一视觉语言模型(VLM)作为生成奖励模型，能够区分给定任务和评估标准下的优胜者和失败者。基于OneReward开发了Seedream 3.0 Fill模型，通过多任务强化学习直接在预训练基础模型上训练，无需任务特定的SFT

Result: 实验结果表明，统一的编辑模型在多个评估维度上持续优于商业和开源竞争对手，如Ideogram、Adobe Photoshop和FLUX Fill [Pro]

Conclusion: OneReward框架证明了使用单一奖励模型可以有效提升多任务生成能力，特别是在图像编辑任务中，为多任务强化学习提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning
framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple
tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model.
By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward
model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given
evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation
models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives.
We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further
divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object
removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although
these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ
significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing
methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits
generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop
Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task
reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the
need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified
edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source
competitors, such as Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro], across
multiple evaluation dimensions. Code and model are available at:

TL;DR: Dress&Dance是一个视频扩散框架，能够生成高质量的用户穿着指定服装并按照参考视频动作的虚拟试穿视频，支持多种服装类型和单次处理上下装同时试穿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的虚拟试穿解决方案在视频生成质量和动作保真度方面存在不足，需要开发一个能够处理多模态输入并生成高质量试穿视频的系统。

Method: 采用CondNet条件网络，通过注意力机制统一处理文本、图像和视频等多模态输入，使用多阶段渐进式训练方法结合有限的视频数据和大量图像数据。

Result: 该框架能够生成1152x720分辨率、24FPS、5秒时长的优质试穿视频，在服装注册和动作保真度方面优于现有开源和商业解决方案。

Conclusion: Dress&Dance提供了一个高质量且灵活的虚拟试穿体验，通过创新的条件网络设计和多模态训练策略，显著提升了虚拟试穿视频的生成质量。

Abstract: We present Dress&Dance, a video diffusion framework that generates high
quality 5-second-long 24 FPS virtual try-on videos at 1152x720 resolution of a
user wearing desired garments while moving in accordance with a given reference
video. Our approach requires a single user image and supports a range of tops,
bottoms, and one-piece garments, as well as simultaneous tops and bottoms
try-on in a single pass. Key to our framework is CondNet, a novel conditioning
network that leverages attention to unify multi-modal inputs (text, images, and
videos), thereby enhancing garment registration and motion fidelity. CondNet is
trained on heterogeneous training data, combining limited video data and a
larger, more readily available image dataset, in a multistage progressive
manner. Dress&Dance outperforms existing open source and commercial solutions
and enables a high quality and flexible try-on experience.

### [98] [First-Place Solution to NeurIPS 2024 Invisible Watermark Removal Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21072)
*Fahad Shamshad,Tameem Bakr,Yahia Shaaban,Noor Hussein,Karthik Nandakumar,Nils Lukas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对NeurIPS 2024隐式水印擦除挑战的获胜解决方案，包含黑盒和白盒两种攻击方法，实现了95.7%的近完美水印去除率，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数字水印技术在对抗性攻击下的鲁棒性不明确，需要通过挑战赛来测试水印在各种对抗条件下的稳健性。

Method: 白盒跟踪使用基于VAE的自适应规避攻击，结合测试时优化和CIELAB空间的颜色对比度恢复；黑盒跟踪通过空间或频域伪影聚类，应用图像到图像扩散模型，结合受控噪声注入和ChatGPT生成的语义先验。

Result: 经验评估显示该方法成功实现了近完美水印去除（95.7%），对剩余图像质量影响可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 该攻击方法有望激发更鲁棒的图像水印技术的发展。

Abstract: Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and
copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing
watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning
solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which
stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge.
The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track,
depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by
the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based
evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in
CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first
cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain.
Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection
and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with
optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method
successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible
impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the
development of more robust image watermarking methods.
