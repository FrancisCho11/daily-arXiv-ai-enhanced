### [1] [SoC-DT: Standard-of-Care Aligned Digital Twins for Patient-Specific Tumor Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03287)
*Moinak Bhattacharya,Gagandeep Singh,Prateek Prasanna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了标准护理数字孪生(SoC-DT)框架，统一反应-扩散肿瘤生长模型和离散标准护理干预，通过可微分求解器预测治疗后肿瘤结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统反应-扩散模型无法捕捉异质性治疗范式下的肿瘤动态，需要能真实模拟标准护理干预并考虑患者基因组、人口统计学和治疗方案差异的计算框架。

Method: 结合反应-扩散肿瘤生长模型、离散标准护理干预(手术、化疗、放疗)以及基因组和人口统计学个性化，使用IMEX-SoC隐式-显式指数时间差分求解器确保稳定性、正性和可扩展性。

Result: 在合成数据和真实世界胶质瘤数据上评估，SoC-DT在预测肿瘤动态方面始终优于经典PDE基线和纯数据驱动的神经模型。

Conclusion: SoC-DT通过将机制可解释性与现代可微分求解器相结合，为肿瘤学中患者特异性数字孪生建立了原则性基础，实现生物学一致的肿瘤动态估计。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of tumor trajectories under standard-of-care (SoC)
therapies remains a major unmet need in oncology. This capability is essential
for optimizing treatment planning and anticipating disease progression.
Conventional reaction-diffusion models are limited in scope, as they fail to
capture tumor dynamics under heterogeneous therapeutic paradigms. There is
hence a critical need for computational frameworks that can realistically
simulate SoC interventions while accounting for inter-patient variability in
genomics, demographics, and treatment regimens. We introduce Standard-of-Care
Digital Twin (SoC-DT), a differentiable framework that unifies
reaction-diffusion tumor growth models, discrete SoC interventions (surgery,
chemotherapy, radiotherapy) along with genomic and demographic personalization
to predict post-treatment tumor structure on imaging. An implicit-explicit
exponential time-differencing solver, IMEX-SoC, is also proposed, which ensures
stability, positivity, and scalability in SoC treatment situations. Evaluated
on both synthetic data and real world glioma data, SoC-DT consistently
outperforms classical PDE baselines and purely data-driven neural models in
predicting tumor dynamics. By bridging mechanistic interpretability with modern
differentiable solvers, SoC-DT establishes a principled foundation for
patient-specific digital twins in oncology, enabling biologically consistent
tumor dynamics estimation. Code will be made available upon acceptance.

Method: 使用优化的ONNX模型、异构批量推理和高吞吐量并行化，构建分布式多GPU推理系统，生成带时间戳的出现记录，并通过交互式可视化平台展示多种图表。

Result: 系统能够高效处理大量视频数据，生成包括出现频率、时长分析、共现矩阵、网络图等在内的多维度可视化，揭示名人出现模式、时间动态和关系演变。

Abstract: In an era dominated by video content, understanding its structure and
dynamics has become increasingly important. This paper presents a hybrid
framework that combines a distributed multi-GPU inference system with an
interactive visualization platform for analyzing celebrity dynamics in video
episodes. The inference framework efficiently processes large volumes of video
data by leveraging optimized ONNX models, heterogeneous batch inference, and
high-throughput parallelism, ensuring scalable generation of timestamped
appearance records. These records are then transformed into a comprehensive
suite of visualizations, including appearance frequency charts, duration
analyses, pie charts, co-appearance matrices, network graphs, stacked area
charts, seasonal comparisons, and heatmaps. Together, these visualizations
provide multi-dimensional insights into video content, revealing patterns in
celebrity prominence, screen-time distribution, temporal dynamics,
co-appearance relationships, and intensity across episodes and seasons. The
interactive nature of the system allows users to dynamically explore data,
identify key moments, and uncover evolving relationships between individuals.
By bridging distributed recognition with structured, visually-driven analytics,
this work enables new possibilities for entertainment analytics, content
creation strategies, and audience engagement studies.

### [3] [Domain-Robust Marine Plastic Detection Using Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03294)
*Saanvi Kataria*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文评估了多种深度学习模型在水下塑料垃圾跨域检测中的性能，发现轻量级CNN模型MobileNetV2表现最佳，而零样本模型CLIP和Gemini各有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋塑料污染是紧迫的环境威胁，需要可靠的水下碎片自动检测系统。但由于域偏移问题，在一个数据集上训练的系统在新图像上性能会下降。

Method: 在标记的水下数据集上训练CNN（MobileNetV2、ResNet-18、EfficientNet-B0）和视觉变换器（DeiT-Tiny、ViT-B16），然后在来自不同来源的跨域测试集上评估。同时评估了零样本模型CLIP ViT-L14和Gemini 2.0 Flash。

Result: 轻量级MobileNetV2提供最强的跨域性能（F1 0.97），超过更大模型。所有微调模型都实现了高精度（约99%），但在召回率上存在差异。零样本CLIP相对敏感但容易产生假阳性，而Gemini则相反。

Conclusion: 具有监督训练的紧凑CNN可以有效地泛化用于跨域水下检测，而大型预训练视觉语言模型提供了互补优势。

Abstract: Marine plastic pollution is a pressing environmental threat, making reliable
automation for underwater debris detection essential. However, vision systems
trained on one dataset often degrade on new imagery due to domain shift. This
study benchmarks models for cross-domain robustness, training convolutional
neural networks - CNNs (MobileNetV2, ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision
transformers (DeiT-Tiny, ViT-B16) on a labeled underwater dataset and then
evaluates them on a balanced cross-domain test set built from plastic-positive
images drawn from a different source and negatives from the training domain.
Two zero-shot models were assessed, CLIP ViT-L14 and Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash,
that leverage pretraining to classify images without fine-tuning. Results show
the lightweight MobileNetV2 delivers the strongest cross-domain performance (F1
0.97), surpassing larger models. All fine-tuned models achieved high Precision
(around 99%), but differ in Recall, indicating varying sensitivity to plastic
instances. Zero-shot CLIP is comparatively sensitive (Recall around 80%) yet
prone to false positives (Precision around 56%), whereas Gemini exhibits the
inverse profile (Precision around 99%, Recall around 81%). Error analysis
highlights recurring confusions with coral textures, suspended particulates,
and specular glare. Overall, compact CNNs with supervised training can
generalize effectively for cross-domain underwater detection, while large
pretrained vision-language models provide complementary strengths.

### [4] [Multimodal Arabic Captioning with Interpretable Visual Concept Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03295)
*Passant Elchafei,Amany Fashwan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLCAP是一个阿拉伯语图像描述框架，结合CLIP视觉标签检索和多模态文本生成，通过提取可解释的阿拉伯视觉概念来生成文化连贯的阿拉伯语图像描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统端到端图像描述方法缺乏可解释性，需要开发能够生成文化连贯且上下文准确的阿拉伯语图像描述的方法。

Method: 使用三种多语言编码器(mCLIP、AraCLIP、Jina V4)进行视觉标签检索，构建包含训练描述和约21K通用领域标签的混合词汇表，然后将检索到的标签转换为阿拉伯语提示，与原始图像一起输入视觉语言模型进行描述生成。

Result: mCLIP + Gemini Pro Vision组合在BLEU-1(5.34%)和余弦相似度(60.01%)上表现最佳，AraCLIP + Qwen-VL组合在LLM-judge评分(36.33%)上最高。

Conclusion: VLCAP框架能够生成文化连贯且上下文准确的阿拉伯语图像描述，为阿拉伯语图像理解提供了可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: We present VLCAP, an Arabic image captioning framework that integrates
CLIP-based visual label retrieval with multimodal text generation. Rather than
relying solely on end-to-end captioning, VLCAP grounds generation in
interpretable Arabic visual concepts extracted with three multilingual
encoders, mCLIP, AraCLIP, and Jina V4, each evaluated separately for label
retrieval. A hybrid vocabulary is built from training captions and enriched
with about 21K general domain labels translated from the Visual Genome dataset,
covering objects, attributes, and scenes. The top-k retrieved labels are
transformed into fluent Arabic prompts and passed along with the original image
to vision-language models. In the second stage, we tested Qwen-VL and Gemini
Pro Vision for caption generation, resulting in six encoder-decoder
configurations. The results show that mCLIP + Gemini Pro Vision achieved the
best BLEU-1 (5.34%) and cosine similarity (60.01%), while AraCLIP + Qwen-VL
obtained the highest LLM-judge score (36.33%). This interpretable pipeline
enables culturally coherent and contextually accurate Arabic captions.

### [5] [Convolutional Neural Nets vs Vision Transformers: A SpaceNet Case Study with Balanced vs Imbalanced Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03297)
*Akshar Gothi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 对比EfficientNet-B0和ViT-Base在SpaceNet数据集上的性能，分析在标签不平衡和平衡两种分布下的表现差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较卷积神经网络和视觉Transformer在不同标签分布下的性能差异，特别是在计算资源受限的部署场景下。

Method: 在SpaceNet数据集上进行控制实验，使用两种标签分布（自然不平衡和平衡重采样），匹配预处理、轻量增强和40轮训练预算，评估准确率、宏F1、平衡准确率等指标。

Result: 在不平衡分布下，EfficientNet-B0达到93%测试准确率且延迟更低；ViT-Base也达到93%但参数更多。在平衡分布下，两者性能都很强，EfficientNet-B0达到99%，但ViT-Base仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: 平衡标签分布能缩小架构差距，但CNN在效率方面仍保持优势。

Abstract: We present a controlled comparison of a convolutional neural network
(EfficientNet-B0) and a Vision Transformer (ViT-Base) on SpaceNet under two
label-distribution regimes: a naturally imbalanced five-class split and a
balanced-resampled split with 700 images per class (70:20:10 train/val/test).
With matched preprocessing (224x224, ImageNet normalization), lightweight
augmentations, and a 40-epoch budget on a single NVIDIA P100, we report
accuracy, macro-F1, balanced accuracy, per-class recall, and deployment metrics
(model size and latency). On the imbalanced split, EfficientNet-B0 reaches 93%
test accuracy with strong macro-F1 and lower latency; ViT-Base is competitive
at 93% with a larger parameter count and runtime. On the balanced split, both
models are strong; EfficientNet-B0 reaches 99% while ViT-Base remains
competitive, indicating that balancing narrows architecture gaps while CNNs
retain an efficiency edge. We release manifests, logs, and per-image
predictions to support reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基础设施措施在动态城市环境中保护弱势道路使用者效果有限，而现有AI应用综述主要关注检测任务，缺乏对全面VRU理解和保护所需的其他视觉任务的覆盖。

Method: 系统性地回顾了过去五年基于摄像头的AI感知系统在VRU安全领域的研究进展，重点分析了四个核心任务：检测分类、跟踪重识别、轨迹预测、意图识别预测。

Result: 识别了AI赋能的主动式VRU保护解决方案的技术框架，并指出了从数据、模型和部署三个角度面临的四大开放挑战。

Conclusion: 通过将视觉AI进展与现实世界实施的实际考虑联系起来，本综述为开发下一代感知系统以增强VRU安全提供了基础参考。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and
cyclists, remains a critical global challenge, as conventional
infrastructure-based measures often prove inadequate in dynamic urban
environments. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in
visual perception and reasoning, open new opportunities for proactive and
context-aware VRU protection. However, existing surveys on AI applications for
VRUs predominantly focus on detection, offering limited coverage of other
vision-based tasks that are essential for comprehensive VRU understanding and
protection. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of recent progress in
camera-based AI sensing systems for VRU safety, with an emphasis on
developments from the past five years and emerging research trends. We
systematically examine four core tasks, namely detection and classification,
tracking and reidentification, trajectory prediction, and intent recognition
and prediction, which together form the backbone of AI-empowered proactive
solutions for VRU protection in intelligent transportation systems. To guide
future research, we highlight four major open challenges from the perspectives
of data, model, and deployment. By linking advances in visual AI with practical
considerations for real-world implementation, this survey aims to provide a
foundational reference for the development of next-generation sensing systems
to enhance VRU safety.

### [7] [The View From Space: Navigating Instrumentation Differences with EOFMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03316)
*Ryan P. Demilt,Nicholas LaHaye,Karis Tenneson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 地球观测基础模型对传感器架构高度敏感，理解这种差异对模型开发和使用至关重要


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有地球观测基础模型大多在单一模态数据上训练，但实际应用时跨模态匹配，不清楚不同传感器架构对模型内部表示的影响

Method: 分析不同传感器架构对地球观测基础模型表示空间的影响

Result: 发现地球观测基础模型的表示空间对传感器架构高度敏感

Conclusion: 理解传感器架构差异对当前地球观测基础模型设计的缺陷提供了重要视角，并为模型开发和使用指明了前进方向

Abstract: Earth Observation Foundation Models (EOFMs) have exploded in prevalence as
tools for processing the massive volumes of remotely sensed and other earth
observation data, and for delivering impact on the many essential earth
monitoring tasks. An emerging trend posits using the outputs of pre-trained
models as 'embeddings' which summarize high dimensional data to be used for
generic tasks such as similarity search and content-specific queries. However,
most EOFM models are trained only on single modalities of data and then applied
or benchmarked by matching bands across different modalities. It is not clear
from existing work what impact diverse sensor architectures have on the
internal representations of the present suite of EOFMs. We show in this work
that the representation space of EOFMs is highly sensitive to sensor
architecture and that understanding this difference gives a vital perspective
on the pitfalls of current EOFM design and signals for how to move forward as
model developers, users, and a community guided by robust remote-sensing
science.

### [8] [Photorealistic Inpainting for Perturbation-based Explanations in Ecological Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03317)
*Günel Aghakishiyeva,Jiayi Zhou,Saagar Arya,James David Poling,Holly R. Houliston,Jamie N. Womble,David W. Johnston,Brinnae Bent*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于修复引导的扰动解释技术，通过生成逼真的局部编辑来揭示视觉模型在生态监测中的决策依据，解决了传统方法导致的分布外问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生态监测中视觉模型的预测不透明限制了信任和实际应用，需要能够保持场景上下文、揭示细粒度形态线索的解释方法。

Method: 使用修复引导的扰动技术，结合Segment-Anything-Model优化的掩码，进行对象移除/替换和背景替换，生成逼真的局部编辑。

Result: 该方法能够准确定位诊断结构，避免传统扰动常见的删除伪影，在港口海豹检测任务中表现出良好的解释效果。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了领域相关的见解，支持专家验证，有助于在生态学中更可信地部署人工智能。

Abstract: Ecological monitoring is increasingly automated by vision models, yet opaque
predictions limit trust and field adoption. We present an inpainting-guided,
perturbation-based explanation technique that produces photorealistic,
mask-localized edits that preserve scene context. Unlike masking or blurring,
these edits stay in-distribution and reveal which fine-grained morphological
cues drive predictions in tasks such as species recognition and trait
attribution. We demonstrate the approach on a YOLOv9 detector fine-tuned for
harbor seal detection in Glacier Bay drone imagery, using
Segment-Anything-Model-refined masks to support two interventions: (i) object
removal/replacement (e.g., replacing seals with plausible ice/water or boats)
and (ii) background replacement with original animals composited onto new
scenes. Explanations are assessed by re-scoring perturbed images (flip rate,
confidence drop) and by expert review for ecological plausibility and
interpretability. The resulting explanations localize diagnostic structures,
avoid deletion artifacts common to traditional perturbations, and yield
domain-relevant insights that support expert validation and more trustworthy
deployment of AI in ecology.

Abstract: Medical Image Segmentation (MIS) stands as a cornerstone in medical image
analysis, playing a pivotal role in precise diagnostics, treatment planning,
and monitoring of various medical conditions. This paper presents a
comprehensive and systematic survey of MIS methodologies, bridging the gap
between traditional image processing techniques and modern deep learning
approaches. The survey encompasses thresholding, edge detection, region-based
segmentation, clustering algorithms, and model-based techniques while also
delving into state-of-the-art deep learning architectures such as Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs), Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs), and the widely
adopted U-Net and its variants. Moreover, integrating attention mechanisms,
semi-supervised learning, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and
Transformer-based models is thoroughly explored. In addition to covering
established methods, this survey highlights emerging trends, including hybrid
architectures, cross-modality learning, federated and distributed learning
frameworks, and active learning strategies, which aim to address challenges
such as limited labeled datasets, computational complexity, and model
generalizability across diverse imaging modalities. Furthermore, a specialized
case study on lumbar spine segmentation is presented, offering insights into
the challenges and advancements in this relatively underexplored anatomical
region. Despite significant progress in the field, critical challenges persist,
including dataset bias, domain adaptation, interpretability of deep learning
models, and integration into real-world clinical workflows.

### [10] [DECOR: Deep Embedding Clustering with Orientation Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03328)
*Fiona Victoria Stanley Jothiraj,Arunaggiri Pandian Karunanidhi,Seth A. Eichmeyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DECOR是一个面向晶圆缺陷检测的深度聚类框架，通过考虑晶圆图的方位变化，能够在复杂、不平衡且未标记的数据条件下可靠地聚类缺陷模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半导体制造中，晶圆缺陷的早期检测对产品良率优化至关重要。原始晶圆数据通常复杂、未标记、不平衡，且单个晶圆可能包含多个缺陷，需要设计在非理想数据条件下仍可靠的聚类方法。

Method: DECOR框架通过深度聚类结合方位鲁棒性，明确考虑晶圆图中的方位变化，确保空间相似的缺陷无论其旋转或对齐方式如何都能被一致地聚类。

Result: 在MixedWM38数据集上的实验表明，DECOR能够无需手动调参即可发现聚类，且性能优于现有的聚类基线方法。

Conclusion: DECOR为自动化视觉检测系统提供了一个可靠且可扩展的解决方案，能够有效处理晶圆缺陷检测中的复杂数据条件。

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, early detection of wafer defects is critical
for product yield optimization. However, raw wafer data from wafer quality
tests are often complex, unlabeled, imbalanced and can contain multiple defects
on a single wafer, making it crucial to design clustering methods that remain
reliable under such imperfect data conditions. We introduce DECOR, a deep
clustering with orientation robustness framework that groups complex defect
patterns from wafer maps into consistent clusters. We evaluate our method on
the open source MixedWM38 dataset, demonstrating its ability to discover
clusters without manual tuning. DECOR explicitly accounts for orientation
variations in wafer maps, ensuring that spatially similar defects are
consistently clustered regardless of its rotation or alignment. Experiments
indicate that our method outperforms existing clustering baseline methods, thus
providing a reliable and scalable solution in automated visual inspection
systems.

### [11] [Error correction in multiclass image classification of facial emotion on unbalanced samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03337)
*Andrey A. Lebedev,Victor B. Kazantsev,Sergey V. Stasenko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于LSTM和注意力机制的面部表情分类方法，专门针对类别不平衡问题，通过错误校正技术提高对小类别的识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决面部表情分类中类别不平衡的问题，其中某些情绪类别显著多于其他类别，影响分类器的性能。

Method: 使用基于LSTM的神经网络模型，结合注意力机制聚焦于面部关键区域，在六个类别的子集上训练模型，然后对第七个类别进行错误校正。

Result: 实验表明所有类别都可以进行校正，但成功率不同。在测试集上，对小类别的关键质量指标有所提升，表明该方法在寻找罕见事件方面具有潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法可有效应用于面部表情分析系统，以及在类别分布倾斜情况下需要稳定分类的任务中。

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of error correction in multi-class
classification of face images on unbalanced samples. The study is based on the
analysis of a data frame containing images labeled by seven different emotional
states of people of different ages. Particular attention is paid to the problem
of class imbalance, in which some emotions significantly prevail over others.
To solve the classification problem, a neural network model based on LSTM with
an attention mechanism focusing on key areas of the face that are informative
for emotion recognition is used. As part of the experiments, the model is
trained on all possible configurations of subsets of six classes with
subsequent error correction for the seventh class, excluded at the training
stage. The results show that correction is possible for all classes, although
the degree of success varies: some classes are better restored, others are
worse. In addition, on the test sample, when correcting some classes, an
increase in key quality metrics for small classes was recorded, which indicates
the promise of the proposed approach in solving applied problems related to the
search for rare events, for example, in anti-fraud systems. Thus, the proposed
method can be effectively applied in facial expression analysis systems and in
tasks requiring stable classification under skewed class distribution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DCG-Bench基准和DCG-8K数据集，用于评估多模态大语言模型在动态图表生成任务上的能力，并开发了专门的训练方法提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在静态图表生成和理解方面取得进展，但在动态图表生成方面的潜力尚未充分探索，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 构建DCG-8K高质量数据集，包含指令-代码-视频三元组和QA对；采用两阶段训练方法，提出联合代码视觉奖励的组相对策略优化来构建专家模型。

Result: 基准测试显示现有MLLMs在视觉到图表任务中存在不足；提出的模型在三个任务上平均性能提升8.31%，仅用3B参数就达到与专有模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的训练方法有效提升了动态图表生成能力，证明了在有限参数下也能达到优异性能，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Dynamic Chart Generation (DCG) involves producing code-rendered animated
visualizations as charts. While recent advances in multi-modal large language
models (MLLMs) have significantly improved their capability on static chart
generation and comprehension, MLLMs' potential for handling dynamic chart
generation and understanding remains underexplored. To bridge this research
gap, we introduce DCG-Bench (Dynamic Chart Generation Benchmark), the first
benchmark evaluating MLLM's capability on dynamic chart generation tasks from
three dimensions: Simple Text-to-Chart, Detailed Text-to-Chart, and
Video-to-Chart tasks. We construct DCG-8K, a high-quality DCG dataset with
annotations covering instruction-code-video triplets and QA pairs for both code
and video evaluation. Based on DCG-8K, we explored a two-stage training recipe,
proposing Joint-Code-Visual Reward for group relative policy optimization to
construct expert MLLM Qwen2.5-VL-DCG-3B for the DCG task. Our benchmarking
result reveals shortcomings of existing MLLMs in the visual-to-chart task, and
our model beats the best open-sourced MLLM with an average 8.31% performance
gain across three tasks, and shows on par performance against proprietary
models with only 3B parameters, proving the effectiveness of our training
recipe. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

*Vlardimir Yugay,Duy-Kien Nguyen,Theo Gevers,Cees G. M. Snoek,Martin R. Oswald*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VoT是一个端到端的单目视觉里程计Transformer，无需手工组件如捆绑调整、特征匹配或相机标定，直接预测相机运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统视觉里程计方法依赖复杂pipeline、相机标定和超参数调优的问题，以及现有大规模3D模型在处理长视频和精确逐帧估计方面的局限性。

Method: 使用Transformer架构处理单目帧序列，通过时空注意力建模全局关系，直接预测相机运动而无需估计密集几何，仅依赖相机位姿进行监督。

Result: VoT在更大数据集上有效扩展，受益于更强的预训练骨干网络，在不同相机运动和标定设置下泛化良好，性能优于传统方法且运行速度快3倍以上。

Conclusion: 端到端的单目视觉里程计是可行的，VoT框架展示了无需手工组件的直接相机运动预测方法，具有模块化、灵活性和高效性优势。

Abstract: Modern monocular visual odometry methods typically combine pre-trained deep
learning components with optimization modules, resulting in complex pipelines
that rely heavily on camera calibration and hyperparameter tuning, and often
struggle in unseen real-world scenarios. Recent large-scale 3D models trained
on massive amounts of multi-modal data have partially alleviated these
challenges, providing generalizable dense reconstruction and camera pose
estimation. Still, they remain limited in handling long videos and providing
accurate per-frame estimates, which are required for visual odometry. In this
work, we demonstrate that monocular visual odometry can be addressed
effectively in an end-to-end manner, thereby eliminating the need for
handcrafted components such as bundle adjustment, feature matching, camera
calibration, or dense 3D reconstruction. We introduce VoT, short for Visual
odometry Transformer, which processes sequences of monocular frames by
extracting features and modeling global relationships through temporal and
spatial attention. Unlike prior methods, VoT directly predicts camera motion
without estimating dense geometry and relies solely on camera poses for
supervision. The framework is modular and flexible, allowing seamless
integration of various pre-trained encoders as feature extractors. Experimental
results demonstrate that VoT scales effectively with larger datasets, benefits
substantially from stronger pre-trained backbones, generalizes across diverse
camera motions and calibration settings, and outperforms traditional methods
while running more than 3 times faster. The code will be released.

*Mahdi Farahbakhsh,Vishnu Teja Kunde,Dileep Kalathil,Krishna Narayanan,Jean-Francois Chamberland*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于侧信息的推理时搜索算法，用于改进扩散模型在逆问题中的重建质量，平衡探索与利用，避免梯度引导的奖励黑客伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型方法通常忽略侧信息，而这些信息在严重不适定问题中能显著提升重建质量。梯度引导方法容易产生伪影。

Method: 设计推理时搜索算法，利用侧信息引导采样过程，平衡探索与利用，可无缝集成到现有扩散重建流程中。

Result: 在多种逆问题（框内修复、超分辨率、运动/高斯/非线性/盲去模糊）上，定性定量性能均一致提升，优于基于奖励梯度的基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的侧信息搜索方法能有效提升扩散模型在图像重建任务中的性能，提供更准确可靠的重建结果。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for solving inverse
problems. However, existing approaches typically overlook side information that
could significantly improve reconstruction quality, especially in severely
ill-posed settings. In this work, we propose a novel inference-time search
algorithm that guides the sampling process using the side information in a
manner that balances exploration and exploitation. This enables more accurate
and reliable reconstructions, providing an alternative to the gradient-based
guidance that is prone to reward-hacking artifacts. Our approach can be
seamlessly integrated into a wide range of existing diffusion-based image
reconstruction pipelines. Through extensive experiments on a number of inverse
problems, such as box inpainting, super-resolution, and various deblurring
tasks including motion, Gaussian, nonlinear, and blind deblurring, we show that
our approach consistently improves the qualitative and quantitative performance
of diffusion-based image reconstruction algorithms. We also show the superior
performance of our approach with respect to other baselines, including reward
gradient-based guidance algorithms. The code is available at

Abstract: Sonar images are relevant for advancing underwater exploration, autonomous
navigation, and ecosystem monitoring. However, the progress depends on data
availability. The scarcity of publicly available, well-annotated sonar image
datasets creates a significant bottleneck for the development of robust machine
learning models. This paper presents a comprehensive and concise review of the
current landscape of sonar image datasets, seeking not only to catalog existing
resources but also to contextualize them, identify gaps, and provide a clear
roadmap, serving as a base guide for researchers of any kind who wish to start
or advance in the field of underwater acoustic data analysis. We mapped
publicly accessible datasets across various sonar modalities, including Side
Scan Sonar (SSS), Forward-Looking Sonar (FLS), Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS),
Multibeam Echo Sounder (MBES), and Dual-Frequency Identification Sonar
(DIDSON). An analysis was conducted on applications such as classification,
detection, segmentation, and 3D reconstruction. This work focuses on
state-of-the-art advancements, incorporating newly released datasets. The
findings are synthesized into a master table and a chronological timeline,
offering a clear and accessible comparison of characteristics, sizes, and
annotation details datasets.

TL;DR: 提出溯源网络，一种新型神经网络模型，通过将预测直接链接到训练样本来提供端到端的可解释性，类似于学习的KNN方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统深度学习模型的不透明性、幻觉问题，以及为数据贡献者分配信用，提高模型的透明度、鲁棒性和可信度。

Method: 在模型架构中嵌入可解释性，将每个输出与支持训练样本直接关联，通过联合优化主任务和可解释性目标来学习特征空间中的相关性权重。

Conclusion: 溯源网络为现有可解释性技术提供了补充方法，虽然引入额外计算成本且目前适用于中等规模数据集，但显著提升了神经模型的透明度和可信度。

Abstract: We introduce provenance networks, a novel class of neural models designed to
provide end-to-end, training-data-driven explainability. Unlike conventional
post-hoc methods, provenance networks learn to link each prediction directly to
its supporting training examples as part of the model's normal operation,
embedding interpretability into the architecture itself. Conceptually, the
model operates similarly to a learned KNN, where each output is justified by
concrete exemplars weighted by relevance in the feature space. This approach
facilitates systematic investigations of the trade-off between memorization and
generalization, enables verification of whether a given input was included in
the training set, aids in the detection of mislabeled or anomalous data points,
enhances resilience to input perturbations, and supports the identification of
similar inputs contributing to the generation of a new data point. By jointly
optimizing the primary task and the explainability objective, provenance
networks offer insights into model behavior that traditional deep networks
cannot provide. While the model introduces additional computational cost and
currently scales to moderately sized datasets, it provides a complementary
approach to existing explainability techniques. In particular, it addresses
critical challenges in modern deep learning, including model opaqueness,
hallucination, and the assignment of credit to data contributors, thereby
improving transparency, robustness, and trustworthiness in neural models.

Motivation: 现有无监督异常检测方法存在匹配噪声问题，且单模态和多模态方法研究相对孤立。作者希望从匹配角度统一处理这两种场景，提升检测能力。

Result: 在22个不同基准测试上的综合实验表明，UCF能有效提升各种无监督异常检测方法，在单模态（RGB）和多模态（RGB-3D、RGB-Text）场景下均达到新的最先进水平。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) aims to identify image- and pixel-level
anomalies using only normal training data, with wide applications such as
industrial inspection and medical analysis, where anomalies are scarce due to
privacy concerns and cold-start constraints. Existing methods, whether
reconstruction-based (restoring normal counterparts) or embedding-based
(pretrained representations), fundamentally conduct image- or feature-level
matching to generate anomaly maps. Nonetheless, matching noise has been largely
overlooked, limiting their detection ability. Beyond earlier focus on unimodal
RGB-based UAD, recent advances expand to multimodal scenarios, e.g., RGB--3D
and RGB--Text, enabled by point cloud sensing and vision--language models.
Despite shared challenges, these lines remain largely isolated, hindering a
comprehensive understanding and knowledge transfer. In this paper, we advocate
unified UAD for both unimodal and multimodal settings in the matching
perspective. Under this insight, we present Unified Cost Filtering (UCF), a
generic post-hoc refinement framework for refining anomaly cost volume of any
UAD model. The cost volume is constructed by matching a test sample against
normal samples from the same or different modalities, followed by a learnable
filtering module with multi-layer attention guidance from the test sample,
mitigating matching noise and highlighting subtle anomalies. Comprehensive
experiments on 22 diverse benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of UCF in
enhancing a variety of UAD methods, consistently achieving new state-of-the-art
results in both unimodal (RGB) and multimodal (RGB--3D, RGB--Text) UAD
scenarios. Code and models will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业图纸数字化过程中，物体检测的准确性至关重要，但现有方法缺乏自动评估检测结果质量的机制。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型的多模态能力，识别缺失或不一致的检测结果，实现自动化质量评估和检测结果优化。

Result: 该框架能够自动评估物体检测质量，提高复杂工业图纸上的整体检测性能。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型为工业图纸物体检测提供了有效的自动化质量评估解决方案，推动了工业图纸数字化进程。

Abstract: Industrial diagrams such as piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) are
essential for the design, operation, and maintenance of industrial plants.
Converting these diagrams into digital form is an important step toward
building digital twins and enabling intelligent industrial automation. A
central challenge in this digitalization process is accurate object detection.
Although recent advances have significantly improved object detection
algorithms, there remains a lack of methods to automatically evaluate the
quality of their outputs. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a
framework that employs Visual Language Models (VLMs) to assess object detection
results and guide their refinement. The approach exploits the multimodal
capabilities of VLMs to identify missing or inconsistent detections, thereby
enabling automated quality assessment and improving overall detection
performance on complex industrial diagrams.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced multimodal reasoning but still
face challenges in spatial reasoning for 3D scenes and complex object
configurations. To address this, we introduce SpatialViLT, an enhanced VLM that
integrates spatial features like depth maps, 3D coordinates, and edge maps
through a multi-task learning framework. This approach enriches multimodal
embeddings with spatial understanding. We propose two variants: SpatialViLT and
MaskedSpatialViLT, focusing on full and masked object regions, respectively.
Additionally, SpatialEnsemble combines both approaches, achieving
state-of-the-art accuracy. Our models excel in spatial reasoning categories
such as directional, topological, and proximity relations, as demonstrated on
the challenging Visual Spatial Reasoning (VSR) dataset. This work represents a
significant step in enhancing the spatial intelligence of AI systems, crucial
for advanced multimodal understanding and real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用编码器-解码器网络减少两相光学切片结构照明显微镜中的伪影，通过合成数据训练实现监督去噪


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 两相光学切片结构照明显微镜中，减少采集时间会引入传统去噪方法难以抑制的残余伪影，且缺乏干净的监督训练数据

Method: 使用非对称去噪自编码器和U-Net网络，通过将真实伪影场应用于合成图像来创建合成训练对

Result: 两种网络都提高了图像清晰度，各自在不同类型的伪影抑制方面表现优异

Conclusion: 合成训练能够实现光学切片结构照明显微镜图像的监督去噪，编码器-解码器网络有潜力简化重建工作流程

Abstract: Structured illumination (SI) enhances image resolution and contrast by
projecting patterned light onto a sample. In two-phase optical-sectioning SI
(OS-SI), reduced acquisition time introduces residual artifacts that
conventional denoising struggles to suppress. Deep learning offers an
alternative to traditional methods; however, supervised training is limited by
the lack of clean, optically sectioned ground-truth data. We investigate
encoder-decoder networks for artifact reduction in two-phase OS-SI, using
synthetic training pairs formed by applying real artifact fields to synthetic
images. An asymmetrical denoising autoencoder (DAE) and a U-Net are trained on
the synthetic data, then evaluated on real OS-SI images. Both networks improve
image clarity, with each excelling against different artifact types. These
results demonstrate that synthetic training enables supervised denoising of
OS-SI images and highlight the potential of encoder-decoder networks to
streamline reconstruction workflows.

TL;DR: PEaRL是一个多模态框架，通过通路激活分数整合组织病理学和空间转录组学，使用transformer编码通路信号并通过对比学习与组织学特征对齐，在多个癌症数据集中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖少量高变基因，限制了预测范围并忽略了协调的生物学程序。需要开发能更好捕捉组织表型背后生物学机制的多模态方法。

Method: 使用ssGSEA计算通路激活分数，用transformer编码通路信号，通过对比学习与组织学特征对齐，构建多模态表示。

Result: 在三个癌症ST数据集中，PEaRL在基因和通路水平表达预测上均优于现有方法，Pearson相关系数分别提高达58.9%和20.4%。

Conclusion: 基于通路的转录组表示能产生更生物学忠实和可解释的多模态模型，推动计算病理学超越基因水平嵌入。

Abstract: Integrating histopathology with spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides a
powerful opportunity to link tissue morphology with molecular function. Yet
most existing multimodal approaches rely on a small set of highly variable
genes, which limits predictive scope and overlooks the coordinated biological
programs that shape tissue phenotypes. We present PEaRL (Pathway Enhanced
Representation Learning), a multimodal framework that represents
transcriptomics through pathway activation scores computed with ssGSEA. By
encoding biologically coherent pathway signals with a transformer and aligning
them with histology features via contrastive learning, PEaRL reduces
dimensionality, improves interpretability, and strengthens cross-modal
correspondence. Across three cancer ST datasets (breast, skin, and lymph node),
PEaRL consistently outperforms SOTA methods, yielding higher accuracy for both
gene- and pathway-level expression prediction (up to 58.9 percent and 20.4
percent increase in Pearson correlation coefficient compared to SOTA). These
results demonstrate that grounding transcriptomic representation in pathways
produces more biologically faithful and interpretable multimodal models,
advancing computational pathology beyond gene-level embeddings.

Abstract: Deep learning for medical imaging is hampered by task-specific models that
lack generalizability and prognostic capabilities, while existing 'universal'
approaches suffer from simplistic conditioning and poor medical semantic
understanding. To address these limitations, we introduce DuPLUS, a deep
learning framework for efficient multi-modal medical image analysis. DuPLUS
introduces a novel vision-language framework that leverages hierarchical
semantic prompts for fine-grained control over the analysis task, a capability
absent in prior universal models. To enable extensibility to other medical
tasks, it includes a hierarchical, text-controlled architecture driven by a
unique dual-prompt mechanism. For segmentation, DuPLUS is able to generalize
across three imaging modalities, ten different anatomically various medical
datasets, encompassing more than 30 organs and tumor types. It outperforms the
state-of-the-art task specific and universal models on 8 out of 10 datasets. We
demonstrate extensibility of its text-controlled architecture by seamless
integration of electronic health record (EHR) data for prognosis prediction,
and on a head and neck cancer dataset, DuPLUS achieved a Concordance Index (CI)
of 0.69. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning enables rapid adaptation to new tasks
and modalities from varying centers, establishing DuPLUS as a versatile and
clinically relevant solution for medical image analysis. The code for this work

Abstract: Real-time animal detection and segmentation in natural environments are vital
for wildlife conservation, enabling non-invasive monitoring through remote
camera streams. However, these tasks remain challenging due to limited
computational resources and the cryptic appearance of many species. We propose
a mobile-optimized two-stage deep learning framework that integrates a
Threading Detection Model (TDM) to parallelize YOLOv10-based detection and
MobileSAM-based segmentation. Unlike prior YOLO+SAM pipelines, our approach
improves real-time performance by reducing latency through threading. YOLOv10
handles detection while MobileSAM performs lightweight segmentation, both
executed concurrently for efficient resource use. On the cryptic Houbara
Bustard, a conservation-priority species, our model achieves mAP50 of 0.9627,
mAP75 of 0.7731, mAP95 of 0.7178, and a MobileSAM mIoU of 0.7421. YOLOv10
operates at 43.7 ms per frame, confirming real-time readiness. We introduce a
curated Houbara dataset of 40,000 annotated images to support model training
and evaluation across diverse conditions. The code and dataset used in this

Method: 通过定义相对于柏拉图立体对称群参考框架的注意力机制，引入原则性的权重共享方案，实现连续平移和柏拉图对称性的联合等变性。

Result: 在计算机视觉（CIFAR-10）、3D点云（ScanObjectNN）和分子属性预测（QM9、OMol25）等多个基准测试中，Platonic Transformer通过利用几何约束实现了竞争性性能，且无需额外成本。

Conclusion: Platonic Transformer成功解决了Transformer缺乏几何对称性归纳偏置的问题，在保持标准Transformer效率和灵活性的同时，实现了几何等变性。

Abstract: While widespread, Transformers lack inductive biases for geometric symmetries
common in science and computer vision. Existing equivariant methods often
sacrifice the efficiency and flexibility that make Transformers so effective
through complex, computationally intensive designs. We introduce the Platonic
Transformer to resolve this trade-off. By defining attention relative to
reference frames from the Platonic solid symmetry groups, our method induces a
principled weight-sharing scheme. This enables combined equivariance to
continuous translations and Platonic symmetries, while preserving the exact
architecture and computational cost of a standard Transformer. Furthermore, we
show that this attention is formally equivalent to a dynamic group convolution,
which reveals that the model learns adaptive geometric filters and enables a
highly scalable, linear-time convolutional variant. Across diverse benchmarks
in computer vision (CIFAR-10), 3D point clouds (ScanObjectNN), and molecular
property prediction (QM9, OMol25), the Platonic Transformer achieves
competitive performance by leveraging these geometric constraints at no
additional cost.

Abstract: The generalization of deep neural networks to unknown domains is a major
challenge despite their tremendous progress in recent years. For this reason,
the dynamic area of domain generalization (DG) has emerged. In contrast to
unsupervised domain adaptation, there is no access to or knowledge about the
target domains, and DG methods aim to generalize across multiple different
unseen target domains. Domain generalization is particularly relevant for the
task semantic segmentation which is used in several areas such as biomedicine
or automated driving. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the
rapidly evolving topic of domain generalized semantic segmentation. We cluster
and review existing approaches and identify the paradigm shift towards
foundation-model-based domain generalization. Finally, we provide an extensive
performance comparison of all approaches, which highlights the significant
influence of foundation models on domain generalization. This survey seeks to

Abstract: Endoscopic procedures such as esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and
colonoscopy play a critical role in diagnosing and managing gastrointestinal
(GI) disorders. However, the documentation burden associated with these
procedures place significant strain on gastroenterologists, contributing to
inefficiencies in clinical workflows and physician burnout. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel automated report generation model that leverages
a transformer-based vision encoder and text decoder within a two-stage training
framework. In the first stage, both components are pre-trained on image/text
caption pairs to capture generalized vision-language features, followed by
fine-tuning on images/report pairs to generate clinically meaningful findings.
Our approach not only streamlines the documentation process but also holds
promise for reducing physician workload and improving patient care.

Motivation: 让无人机能够理解人类手绘草图意图，在未知环境中生成安全准确的3D飞行路径，解决传统方法难以处理人类草图与理想投影差异的问题。

Method: 包含SketchAdapter（学习将手绘草图映射到2D投影路径）和DiffPath（从2D投影和第一人称深度图像推断3D轨迹的扩散模型），使用混合标注数据训练。

Result: 在真实世界无人机测试中，低/中等障碍物环境中达到100%成功率，在未知高障碍物环境中达到40%成功率，比关键消融实验高出20-60%的任务完成率。

Conclusion: 混合人工标注和自动标注数据的训练方法，结合模块化设计，显著提升了系统正确理解人类意图和推断3D路径的能力，实现了有效的零样本模拟到现实迁移。

Abstract: We propose SketchPlan, a diffusion-based planner that interprets 2D
hand-drawn sketches over depth images to generate 3D flight paths for drone
navigation. SketchPlan comprises two components: a SketchAdapter that learns to
map the human sketches to projected 2D paths, and DiffPath, a diffusion model
that infers 3D trajectories from 2D projections and a first person view depth
image. Our model achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, generating accurate
and safe flight paths in previously unseen real-world environments. To train
the model, we build a synthetic dataset of 32k flight paths using a diverse set
of photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes. We automatically label the data
by computing 2D projections of the 3D flight paths onto the camera plane, and
use this to train the DiffPath diffusion model. However, since real human 2D
sketches differ significantly from ideal 2D projections, we additionally label
872 of the 3D flight paths with real human sketches and use this to train the
SketchAdapter to infer the 2D projection from the human sketch. We demonstrate
SketchPlan's effectiveness in both simulated and real-world experiments, and
show through ablations that training on a mix of human labeled and auto-labeled
data together with a modular design significantly boosts its capabilities to
correctly interpret human intent and infer 3D paths. In real-world drone tests,
SketchPlan achieved 100\% success in low/medium clutter and 40\% in unseen
high-clutter environments, outperforming key ablations by 20-60\% in task
completion.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生物特征泄漏的防御方法，通过分析姿态-表情潜在空间中的身份信息来检测实时视频会议中的身份劫持攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI驱动的说话头视频会议系统通过传输紧凑的姿态-表情潜在表示来减少带宽，但这些潜在表示可能被劫持，让攻击者实时冒充受害者身份。由于每帧都是合成的，传统的深度伪造检测器完全失效。

Method: 使用姿态条件化的大间隔对比编码器，从传输的潜在表示中分离出持久的身份线索，同时消除瞬时的姿态和表情信息。通过简单的余弦测试来检测非法的身份交换。

Result: 在多个说话头生成模型上的实验表明，该方法始终优于现有的劫持防御方法，能够实时运行，并在分布外场景中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了无需查看重建RGB视频的生物特征泄漏防御，有效解决了AI视频会议系统中的身份劫持安全问题。

Abstract: AI-based talking-head videoconferencing systems reduce bandwidth by sending a
compact pose-expression latent and re-synthesizing RGB at the receiver, but
this latent can be puppeteered, letting an attacker hijack a victim's likeness
in real time. Because every frame is synthetic, deepfake and synthetic video
detectors fail outright. To address this security problem, we exploit a key
observation: the pose-expression latent inherently contains biometric
information of the driving identity. Therefore, we introduce the first
biometric leakage defense without ever looking at the reconstructed RGB video:
a pose-conditioned, large-margin contrastive encoder that isolates persistent
identity cues inside the transmitted latent while cancelling transient pose and
expression. A simple cosine test on this disentangled embedding flags illicit
identity swaps as the video is rendered. Our experiments on multiple
talking-head generation models show that our method consistently outperforms
existing puppeteering defenses, operates in real-time, and shows strong
generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出REVEL任务和DragStream方法，实现自回归视频扩散模型的流式、细粒度拖拽控制，解决潜在分布漂移和上下文干扰问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归视频扩散模型难以实现流式、细粒度的输出控制，无法确保与用户期望一致

Method: 提出训练无关的DragStream方法，包含自适应分布自校正策略和空间频率选择性优化机制

Result: 方法可无缝集成到现有自回归视频扩散模型中，实验验证了其有效性

Conclusion: REVEL任务和DragStream方法为视频编辑和动画提供了灵活的控制能力

Abstract: Achieving streaming, fine-grained control over the outputs of autoregressive
video diffusion models remains challenging, making it difficult to ensure that
they consistently align with user expectations. To bridge this gap, we propose
\textbf{stReaming drag-oriEnted interactiVe vidEo manipuLation (REVEL)}, a new
task that enables users to modify generated videos \emph{anytime} on
\emph{anything} via fine-grained, interactive drag. Beyond DragVideo and
SG-I2V, REVEL unifies drag-style video manipulation as editing and animating
video frames with both supporting user-specified translation, deformation, and
rotation effects, making drag operations versatile. In resolving REVEL, we
observe: \emph{i}) drag-induced perturbations accumulate in latent space,
causing severe latent distribution drift that halts the drag process;
\emph{ii}) streaming drag is easily disturbed by context frames, thereby
yielding visually unnatural outcomes. We thus propose a training-free approach,
\textbf{DragStream}, comprising: \emph{i}) an adaptive distribution
self-rectification strategy that leverages neighboring frames' statistics to
effectively constrain the drift of latent embeddings; \emph{ii}) a
spatial-frequency selective optimization mechanism, allowing the model to fully
exploit contextual information while mitigating its interference via
selectively propagating visual cues along generation. Our method can be
seamlessly integrated into existing autoregressive video diffusion models, and
extensive experiments firmly demonstrate the effectiveness of our DragStream.

TL;DR: 提出GAS-MIL框架，通过集成多个基础模型的互补特征，无需手动特征选择或精细调优，在多种癌症数据集上实现优于或持平单个基础模型和现有MIL方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型为计算病理学提供强大特征提取器，但为特定诊断任务调整和基准测试单个模型耗时耗资源，尤其考虑到其规模和多样性。

Method: GAS-MIL是一种灵活的集成框架，无缝整合多个基础模型特征，保留其互补优势，无需手动特征选择或大量任务特定调优。

Result: 在前列腺癌(PANDA)、卵巢癌(UBC-OCEAN)和乳腺癌(TCGA-BrCa)三个数据集的分类任务中，GAS-MIL持续实现优于或持平单个基础模型和现有MIL方法的性能。

Conclusion: 通过高效整合异质基础模型，GAS-MIL简化了病理学模型部署，为未来多模态和精准肿瘤学应用提供了可扩展基础。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have transformed computational pathology by providing
powerful, general-purpose feature extractors. However, adapting and
benchmarking individual FMs for specific diagnostic tasks is often
time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially given their scale and
diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce Group-Aggregative Selection
Multi-Instance Learning (GAS-MIL), a flexible ensemble framework that
seamlessly integrates features from multiple FMs, preserving their
complementary strengths without requiring manual feature selection or extensive
task-specific fine-tuning. Across classification tasks in three cancer
datasets-prostate (PANDA), ovarian (UBC-OCEAN), and breast (TCGA-BrCa)-GAS-MIL
consistently achieves superior or on-par performance relative to individual FMs
and established MIL methods, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.
By enabling efficient integration of heterogeneous FMs, GAS-MIL streamlines
model deployment for pathology and provides a scalable foundation for future
multimodal and precision oncology applications.

Motivation: 解决无人机递送纳洛酮时旁观者情境感知实时评估的研究空白，支持开发能够有效指导非医疗培训旁观者的自适应无人机系统。

Method: 使用DANDSD数据集，整合几何、运动学和交互图特征，采用图嵌入和Transformer模型进行实时情境感知评估。

Result: 实现了高性能的情境感知预测，在时间分割精度上优于FINCH基线9%的MoF和5%的IoU。

Conclusion: 该框架支持开发自适应无人机系统，能有效指导旁观者，改善紧急响应结果并拯救生命。

Abstract: Rapid naloxone delivery via drones offers a promising solution for responding
to opioid overdose emergencies (OOEs), by extending lifesaving interventions to
medically untrained bystanders before emergency medical services (EMS) arrive.
Recognizing the critical role of bystander situational awareness (SA) in
human-autonomy teaming (HAT), we address a key research gap in real-time SA
assessment by introducing the Drone-Assisted Naloxone Delivery Simulation
Dataset (DANDSD). This pioneering dataset captures HAT during simulated OOEs,
where college students without medical training act as bystanders tasked with
administering intranasal naloxone to a mock overdose victim. Leveraging this
dataset, we propose a video-based real-time SA assessment framework that
utilizes graph embeddings and transformer models to assess bystander SA in real
time. Our approach integrates visual perception and comprehension cues--such as
geometric, kinematic, and interaction graph features--and achieves
high-performance SA prediction. It also demonstrates strong temporal
segmentation accuracy, outperforming the FINCH baseline by 9% in Mean over
Frames (MoF) and 5% in Intersection over Union (IoU). This work supports the
development of adaptive drone systems capable of guiding bystanders
effectively, ultimately improving emergency response outcomes and saving lives.

*Mayimunah Nagayi,Alice Khan,Tamryn Frank,Rina Swart,Clement Nyirenda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估四种开源OCR系统（Tesseract、EasyOCR、PaddleOCR、TrOCR）在食品包装图像上的性能，重点关注成分表和营养成分表的提取能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 包装上的准确OCR对于合规性和营养监测很重要，但由于多语言文本、密集布局、字体变化、反光和曲面等挑战而困难。

Method: 使用231个产品（1,628张图像）的数据集，评估速度和覆盖率，并创建113张图像（60个产品）的真实子集进行准确性评估。使用CER、WER、BLEU、ROUGE-L、F1、覆盖率和执行时间等指标。

Result: 在真实子集上，Tesseract获得最低CER（0.912）和最高BLEU（0.245）。EasyOCR在准确性和多语言支持之间提供良好平衡。PaddleOCR实现近乎完全覆盖但速度较慢，TrOCR表现最差。

Conclusion: 结果为包装特定任务提供了基准，建立了基线，并突出了布局感知方法和文本定位的方向。

Abstract: This study evaluates four open-source Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
systems which are Tesseract, EasyOCR, PaddleOCR, and TrOCR on real world food
packaging images. The aim is to assess their ability to extract ingredient
lists and nutrition facts panels. Accurate OCR for packaging is important for
compliance and nutrition monitoring but is challenging due to multilingual
text, dense layouts, varied fonts, glare, and curved surfaces. A dataset of 231
products (1,628 images) was processed by all four models to assess speed and
coverage, and a ground truth subset of 113 images (60 products) was created for
accuracy evaluation. Metrics include Character Error Rate (CER), Word Error
Rate (WER), BLEU, ROUGE-L, F1, coverage, and execution time. On the ground
truth subset, Tesseract achieved the lowest CER (0.912) and the highest BLEU
(0.245). EasyOCR provided a good balance between accuracy and multilingual
support. PaddleOCR achieved near complete coverage but was slower because it
ran on CPU only due to GPU incompatibility, and TrOCR produced the weakest
results despite GPU acceleration. These results provide a packaging-specific
benchmark, establish a baseline, and highlight directions for layout-aware
methods and text localization.

TL;DR: FrameOracle是一个轻量级即插即用模块，通过预测关键帧和所需帧数来优化视频理解，在保持准确性的同时显著减少输入帧数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频语言模型受限于处理帧数，传统采样策略无法适应信息密度和任务复杂度变化，导致效率低下和信息丢失。

Method: 使用四阶段课程学习训练，前三阶段基于跨模态相似度等弱代理信号，最后阶段利用新数据集FrameOracle-41K的关键帧标注进行强监督。

Result: 在5个VLMs和6个基准测试中，FrameOracle将16帧输入平均减少到10.4帧而不损失准确性；从64帧候选帧减少到13.9帧时准确率提高1.4%。

Conclusion: FrameOracle实现了最先进的效率-准确性权衡，为可扩展视频理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced video understanding, but their
performance is limited by the number of input frames they can process. Existing
frame sampling strategies, such as uniform or fixed-budget selection, often
fail to adapt to variations in information density or task complexity,
resulting in inefficiency and information loss. To address this, we present
FrameOracle, a lightweight and plug-and-play module that predicts both (1)
which frames are most relevant to a given query and (2) how many frames are
needed. FrameOracle is trained using a four-stage curriculum, with the first
three stages relying on weak proxy signals such as cross-modal similarity. In
the final stage, it leverages stronger supervision from a new dataset we
introduce, FrameOracle-41K, the first large-scale VideoQA collection to provide
keyframe annotations specifying the minimal set of frames required to answer
each question. Extensive experiments across five VLMs and six benchmarks
demonstrate that FrameOracle reduces 16-frame inputs to an average of 10.4
frames without any loss in accuracy. When starting from 64-frame candidates, it
reduces the input to an average of 13.9 frames while improving accuracy by
1.4%, achieving state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy trade-offs for scalable
video understanding.

*Faliu Yi,Sherif Abdelfattah,Wei Huang,Adrian Brown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合协同微调方法，结合标记和未标记数据来改进游戏视觉bug检测，减少对目标游戏标记数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏视觉bug的人工识别成本高且需要专业知识，而监督学习模型依赖大量标记数据，但这类bug出现频率低导致数据稀缺。

Method: 采用混合协同微调方法，整合目标游戏和同领域游戏的标记数据，并加入未标记数据来增强特征表示学习。

Result: 实验显示该方法在多个游戏环境中优于传统基线方法，即使只使用50%的目标游戏标记数据仍能保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了游戏视觉bug检测的可扩展性和适应性，有效降低了特定目标游戏标记数据的依赖。

Abstract: Manual identification of visual bugs in video games is a resource-intensive
and costly process, often demanding specialized domain knowledge. While
supervised visual bug detection models offer a promising solution, their
reliance on extensive labeled datasets presents a significant challenge due to
the infrequent occurrence of such bugs. To overcome this limitation, we propose
a hybrid Co-FineTuning (CFT) method that effectively integrates both labeled
and unlabeled data. Our approach leverages labeled samples from the target game
and diverse co-domain games, additionally incorporating unlabeled data to
enhance feature representation learning. This strategy maximizes the utility of
all available data, substantially reducing the dependency on labeled examples
from the specific target game. The developed framework demonstrates enhanced
scalability and adaptability, facilitating efficient visual bug detection
across various game titles. Our experimental results show the robustness of the
proposed method for game visual bug detection, exhibiting superior performance
compared to conventional baselines across multiple gaming environments.
Furthermore, CFT maintains competitive performance even when trained with only
50% of the labeled data from the target game.

*Alexander V. Mantzaris*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HRM模型在MNIST上表现良好（约98%准确率），但在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100等小尺寸自然图像数据集上过拟合严重，性能不如简单的卷积神经网络基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究HRM模型是否可以作为实用的图像分类器，特别是在原始训练条件下（无数据增强、相同优化器设置）。

Method: 使用HRM模型，包含两个Transformer风格模块、一步训练、深度监督、旋转位置嵌入和RMSNorm，在MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上进行评估。

Result: MNIST：约98%测试准确率；CIFAR-10：65.0%测试准确率（CNN基线77.2%）；CIFAR-100：29.7%测试准确率（CNN基线45.3%）。HRM训练速度比CNN慢约30倍。

Conclusion: 在当前形式下，HRM在小分辨率图像分类任务中不如简单的卷积架构，但模型修改可能带来显著改进。

Abstract: This paper asks whether the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) with the two
Transformer-style modules $(f_L,f_H)$, one step (DEQ-style) training, deep
supervision, Rotary Position Embeddings, and RMSNorm can serve as a practical
image classifier. It is evaluated on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 under a
deliberately raw regime: no data augmentation, identical optimizer family with
one-epoch warmup then cosine-floor decay, and label smoothing. HRM optimizes
stably and performs well on MNIST ($\approx 98\%$ test accuracy), but on small
natural images it overfits and generalizes poorly: on CIFAR-10, HRM reaches
65.0\% after 25 epochs, whereas a two-stage Conv--BN--ReLU baseline attains
77.2\% while training $\sim 30\times$ faster per epoch; on CIFAR-100, HRM
achieves only 29.7\% test accuracy despite 91.5\% train accuracy, while the
same CNN reaches 45.3\% test with 50.5\% train accuracy. Loss traces and error
analyses indicate healthy optimization but insufficient image-specific
inductive bias for HRM in this regime. It is concluded that, for
small-resolution image classification without augmentation, HRM is not
competitive with even simple convolutional architectures as the HRM currently
exist but this does not exclude possibilities that modifications to the model
may allow it to improve greatly.

TL;DR: 本文调查了DINOv2自监督学习方法，该方法通过多裁剪视图增强和均值教师自蒸馏技术，在多个基准测试中超越了弱监督方法，展示了transformer骨干网络学习特征的显著涌现特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习的最新进展使得能够学习同时捕获图像高级语义和细粒度空间结构的通用视觉特征。DINOv2在大多数基准测试中超越了弱监督方法，需要系统分析其核心思想和发展历程。

Method: 采用多裁剪视图增强和均值教师自蒸馏方法，基于transformer骨干网络进行特征学习，并与之前的自监督学习和弱监督学习方法进行性能比较。

Result: DINOv2在大多数基准测试中建立了新的最先进水平，超越了弱监督方法如OpenCLIP，其学习特征在各种下游任务中表现出色，并具有显著的涌现特性。

Conclusion: 尽管DINOv2存在一些局限性，但它对自监督学习领域产生了重要影响，并为未来研究方向提供了启示。

Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) have made it possible to
learn general-purpose visual features that capture both the high-level
semantics and the fine-grained spatial structure of images. Most notably, the
recent DINOv2 has established a new state of the art by surpassing weakly
supervised methods (WSL) like OpenCLIP on most benchmarks. In this survey, we
examine the core ideas behind its approach, multi-crop view augmentation and
self-distillation with a mean teacher, and trace their development in previous
work. We then compare the performance of DINO and DINOv2 with other SSL and WSL
methods across various downstream tasks, and highlight some remarkable emergent
properties of their learned features with transformer backbones. We conclude by
briefly discussing DINOv2's limitations, its impact, and future research
directions.

TL;DR: 提出DCS框架，通过扩散模型与FSCIL分类器的协同进化，解决小样本类增量学习中的数据稀缺和灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前FSCIL方法因数据稀缺而泛化能力不足，直接使用扩散模型进行数据增强存在语义不对齐和引导无效的问题。

Method: 采用奖励对齐学习策略，基于分类器状态构建动态多面奖励函数，在特征层面确保语义一致性和多样性，在logits层面促进探索性图像生成和类间区分度。

Result: 在FSCIL基准测试中达到最先进性能，显著提升知识保留和新类学习能力。

Conclusion: DCS框架通过扩散模型与分类器的协同进化，有效解决了FSCIL中的数据稀缺和稳定性-可塑性困境。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) challenges models to sequentially
learn new classes from minimal examples without forgetting prior knowledge, a
task complicated by the stability-plasticity dilemma and data scarcity. Current
FSCIL methods often struggle with generalization due to their reliance on
limited datasets. While diffusion models offer a path for data augmentation,
their direct application can lead to semantic misalignment or ineffective
guidance. This paper introduces Diffusion-Classifier Synergy (DCS), a novel
framework that establishes a mutual boosting loop between diffusion model and
FSCIL classifier. DCS utilizes a reward-aligned learning strategy, where a
dynamic, multi-faceted reward function derived from the classifier's state
directs the diffusion model. This reward system operates at two levels: the
feature level ensures semantic coherence and diversity using prototype-anchored
maximum mean discrepancy and dimension-wise variance matching, while the logits
level promotes exploratory image generation and enhances inter-class
discriminability through confidence recalibration and cross-session
confusion-aware mechanisms. This co-evolutionary process, where generated
images refine the classifier and an improved classifier state yields better
reward signals, demonstrably achieves state-of-the-art performance on FSCIL
benchmarks, significantly enhancing both knowledge retention and new class
learning.

Abstract: Industrial accidents, particularly in high-risk domains such as surface and
underground mining, are frequently caused by unsafe worker behaviors.
Traditional manual inspection remains labor-intensive, error-prone, and
insufficient for large-scale, dynamic environments, highlighting the urgent
need for intelligent and automated safety monitoring. In this paper, we present
MonitorVLM, a novel vision--language framework designed to detect safety
violations directly from surveillance video streams. MonitorVLM introduces
three key innovations: (1) a domain-specific violation dataset comprising 9,000
vision--question--answer (VQA) samples across 40 high-frequency mining
regulations, enriched with augmentation and auxiliary detection cues; (2) a
clause filter (CF) module that dynamically selects the Top-$K$ most relevant
clauses, reducing inference latency by 13.56\% while maintaining accuracy; and
(3) a behavior magnifier (BM) module that enhances worker regions to improve
fine-grained action recognition, yielding additional gains of 3.45% in
precision and 8.62% in recall. Experimental results demonstrate that MonitorVLM
significantly outperforms baseline vision--language models, achieving
improvements of 22.01% in precision, 34.22\% in recall, and 28.37% in F1 score
over the 72B unfine-tuned baseline. A lightweight web-based interface further
integrates MonitorVLM into practical workflows, enabling automatic violation
reporting with video timestamping. This study highlights the potential of
multimodal large models to enhance occupational safety monitoring in mining and
beyond.

Abstract: The integration of Diffusion Models into Intelligent Transportation Systems
(ITS) is a substantial improvement in the detection of accidents. We present a
novel hybrid model integrating guidance classification with diffusion
techniques. By leveraging fine-tuned ExceptionNet architecture outputs as input
for our proposed diffusion model and processing image tensors as our
conditioning, our approach creates a robust classification framework. Our model
consists of multiple conditional modules, which aim to modulate the linear
projection of inputs using time embeddings and image covariate embeddings,
allowing the network to adapt its behavior dynamically throughout the diffusion
process. To address the computationally intensive nature of diffusion models,
our implementation is cloud-based, enabling scalable and efficient processing.
Our strategy overcomes the shortcomings of conventional classification
approaches by leveraging diffusion models inherent capacity to effectively
understand complicated data distributions. We investigate important diffusion
characteristics, such as timestep schedulers, timestep encoding techniques,
timestep count, and architectural design changes, using a thorough ablation
study, and have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed model
against the baseline models on a publicly available dataset. The proposed
diffusion model performs best in image-based accident detection with an
accuracy of 97.32%.

Conclusion: 所提出的SAMSOD方法通过解决模态不平衡和梯度冲突问题，在多个任务和数据集上均表现出优越性能。

Abstract: RGB-T salient object detection (SOD) aims to segment attractive objects by
combining RGB and thermal infrared images. To enhance performance, the Segment
Anything Model has been fine-tuned for this task. However, the imbalance
convergence of two modalities and significant gradient difference between high-
and low- activations are ignored, thereby leaving room for further performance
enhancement. In this paper, we propose a model called \textit{SAMSOD}, which
utilizes unimodal supervision to enhance the learning of non-dominant modality
and employs gradient deconfliction to reduce the impact of conflicting
gradients on model convergence. The method also leverages two decoupled
adapters to separately mask high- and low-activation neurons, emphasizing
foreground objects by enhancing background learning. Fundamental experiments on
RGB-T SOD benchmark datasets and generalizability experiments on scribble
supervised RGB-T SOD, fully supervised RGB-D SOD datasets and full-supervised
RGB-D rail surface defect detection all demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed method.

However, localizing extremely small objects remains a considerable challenge

dataset, which consists of 100,000 pairs of referring expressions and
corresponding bounding boxes for small objects in driving scenarios. Second, we
propose the progressive-iterative zooming adapter (PIZA), an adapter module for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning that enables models to progressively zoom in
and localize small objects. In a series of experiments, we apply PIZA to
GroundingDINO and demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy on the
SOREC dataset. Our dataset, codes and pre-trained models are publicly available

Abstract: Segmenting of clinically important retinal blood vessels into arteries and
veins is a prerequisite for retinal vessel analysis. Such analysis can provide
potential insights and bio-markers for identifying and diagnosing various
retinal eye diseases. Alteration in the regularity and width of the retinal
blood vessels can act as an indicator of the health of the vasculature system
all over the body. It can help identify patients at high risk of developing
vasculature diseases like stroke and myocardial infarction. Over the years,
various Deep Learning architectures have been proposed to perform retinal
vessel segmentation. Recently, attention mechanisms have been increasingly used
in image segmentation tasks. The work proposes a new Deep Learning approach for
artery-vein segmentation. The new approach is based on the Attention mechanism
that is incorporated into the WNet Deep Learning model, and we call the model
as Attention-WNet. The proposed approach has been tested on publicly available
datasets such as HRF and DRIVE datasets. The proposed approach has outperformed
other state-of-art models available in the literature.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究创建了LAION-400M数据集的全面人口统计标注，揭示了训练数据中的人口不平衡和有害关联，并量化了这些偏差对下游模型的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模多模态数据集缺乏人口统计标注的问题，以探究训练数据在产生模型人口偏见中的作用。

Method: 通过验证的自动标注流程，结合目标检测、多模态字幕生成和微调分类器，为LAION-400M数据集创建人物中心标注，包括边界框、感知性别和种族/民族标签。

Result: 发现数据集中存在人口不平衡和有害关联，如男性、黑人及中东裔人群与犯罪相关和负面内容的不成比例关联，并显示CLIP和Stable Diffusion中60-70%的性别偏见可由数据中的直接共现线性解释。

Conclusion: 建立了数据集组成与下游模型偏见之间的大规模实证联系，为理解模型偏差来源提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Vision-language models trained on large-scale multimodal datasets show strong
demographic biases, but the role of training data in producing these biases
remains unclear. A major barrier has been the lack of demographic annotations
in web-scale datasets such as LAION-400M. We address this gap by creating
person-centric annotations for the full dataset, including over 276 million
bounding boxes, perceived gender and race/ethnicity labels, and automatically
generated captions. These annotations are produced through validated automatic
labeling pipelines combining object detection, multimodal captioning, and
finetuned classifiers. Using them, we uncover demographic imbalances and
harmful associations, such as the disproportionate linking of men and
individuals perceived as Black or Middle Eastern with crime-related and
negative content. We also show that 60-70% of gender bias in CLIP and Stable
Diffusion can be linearly explained by direct co-occurrences in the data. Our
resources establish the first large-scale empirical link between dataset
composition and downstream model bias.

Motivation: 现有深度学习检测非正式定居点的方法尚未充分利用预训练神经网络的潜力，需要比较不同类型预训练网络的效果

Method: 使用两种预训练神经网络：1) 在大型多样化通用图像数据集上预训练的通用网络；2) 在卫星图像上预训练的专业网络，比较它们在里约热内卢贫民窟检测任务中的表现

Result: 通过实验比较两种网络在贫民窟检测任务中的性能差异

Conclusion: 研究旨在确定在非正式定居点检测中，任务特定性与预训练数据量哪个因素对性能提升更重要

Abstract: While deep learning methods for detecting informal settlements have already
been developed, they have not yet fully utilized the potential offered by
recent pretrained neural networks. We compare two types of pretrained neural
networks for detecting the favelas of Rio de Janeiro: 1. Generic networks
pretrained on large diverse datasets of unspecific images, 2. A specialized
network pretrained on satellite imagery. While the latter is more specific to
the target task, the former has been pretrained on significantly more images.
Hence, this research investigates whether task specificity or data volume
yields superior performance in urban informal settlement detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LoRA Patching的新方法，通过向Deepfake生成器注入可插拔的LoRA补丁来绕过现有的主动防御系统，同时展示了该方法也能用于防御性目的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的主动Deepfake防御方法缺乏鲁棒性和可靠性，需要开发能够绕过这些防御的新技术，并揭示当前防御范式的弱点。

Method: 使用低秩适应(LoRA)补丁技术，结合可学习的门控机制防止梯度爆炸，并引入多模态特征对齐(MMFA)损失函数在语义层面对齐特征。

Result: 仅使用1,000个面部样本和单轮微调，LoRA补丁就能成功绕过多种主动防御系统，揭示了当前防御策略的关键弱点。

Conclusion: 当前Deepfake防御范式存在严重漏洞，需要开发更鲁棒的防御策略，同时提出的LoRA补丁方法既能用于攻击也能用于防御。

Abstract: Deepfakes pose significant societal risks, motivating the development of
proactive defenses that embed adversarial perturbations in facial images to
prevent manipulation. However, in this paper, we show that these preemptive
defenses often lack robustness and reliability. We propose a novel approach,
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) patching, which injects a plug-and-play LoRA patch
into Deepfake generators to bypass state-of-the-art defenses. A learnable
gating mechanism adaptively controls the effect of the LoRA patch and prevents
gradient explosions during fine-tuning. We also introduce a Multi-Modal Feature
Alignment (MMFA) loss, encouraging the features of adversarial outputs to align
with those of the desired outputs at the semantic level. Beyond bypassing, we
present defensive LoRA patching, embedding visible warnings in the outputs as a
complementary solution to mitigate this newly identified security
vulnerability. With only 1,000 facial examples and a single epoch of
fine-tuning, LoRA patching successfully defeats multiple proactive defenses.
These results reveal a critical weakness in current paradigms and underscore
the need for more robust Deepfake defense strategies. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当测试环境与常规VPR训练数据集差异显著时，现有方法表现不佳。测试时参考集包含目标域的图像和姿态信息，可作为弥补训练-测试领域差距的补充信息源。

Method: 提出了参考集微调（RSF）方法，在测试时参考集上对最先进的VPR模型进行简单微调，利用地图中的目标域信息提升模型性能。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数据集上平均提升了2.3%的Recall@1性能，微调后的模型保持了泛化能力，且RSF方法适用于多种测试数据集。

Conclusion: 参考集微调是一种有效的方法，能够利用测试时参考集中的目标域信息显著提升VPR模型在挑战性环境下的性能，同时保持模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Given a query image, Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is the task of retrieving
an image of the same place from a reference database with robustness to
viewpoint and appearance changes. Recent works show that some VPR benchmarks
are solved by methods using Vision-Foundation-Model backbones and trained on
large-scale and diverse VPR-specific datasets. Several benchmarks remain
challenging, particularly when the test environments differ significantly from
the usual VPR training datasets. We propose a complementary, unexplored source
of information to bridge the train-test domain gap, which can further improve
the performance of State-of-the-Art (SOTA) VPR methods on such challenging
benchmarks. Concretely, we identify that the test-time reference set, the
"map", contains images and poses of the target domain, and must be available
before the test-time query is received in several VPR applications. Therefore,
we propose to perform simple Reference-Set-Finetuning (RSF) of VPR models on
the map, boosting the SOTA (~2.3% increase on average for Recall@1) on these
challenging datasets. Finetuned models retain generalization, and RSF works
across diverse test datasets.

*Jiaxin Deng,Junbiao Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARSAM通过自适应采样-重用-混合分解梯度的方法，显著加速了Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)训练过程，在保持模型泛化能力的同时提供约40%的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM虽然能提高模型泛化能力，但计算成本是SGD的两倍，需要每个优化步骤进行两次梯度计算。为了缓解这个问题，需要开发更高效的SAM变体。

Method: 将SAM梯度分解为SGD梯度和一阶梯度上的二阶梯度投影(PSF)，然后自适应地重用PSF和及时更新PSF来维持模型泛化能力。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100上，ARSAM达到与SAM相当的最先进准确率，同时提供约40%的速度提升。在各种挑战性任务（如人体姿态估计、模型量化）中也能加速优化而不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: ARSAM是一种高效的SAM加速方法，在保持泛化能力的同时显著减少计算成本，具有广泛的实用性。

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves model generalization but doubles
the computational cost of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) by requiring twice
the gradient calculations per optimization step. To mitigate this, we propose
Adaptively sampling-Reusing-mixing decomposed gradients to significantly
accelerate SAM (ARSAM). Concretely, we firstly discover that SAM's gradient can
be decomposed into the SGD gradient and the Projection of the Second-order
gradient onto the First-order gradient (PSF). Furthermore, we observe that the
SGD gradient and PSF dynamically evolve during training, emphasizing the
growing role of the PSF to achieve a flat minima. Therefore, ARSAM is proposed
to the reused PSF and the timely updated PSF still maintain the model's
generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that ARSAM achieves
state-of-the-art accuracies comparable to SAM across diverse network
architectures. On CIFAR-10/100, ARSAM is comparable to SAM while providing a
speedup of about 40\%. Moreover, ARSAM accelerates optimization for the various
challenge tasks (\textit{e.g.}, human pose estimation, and model quantization)
without sacrificing performance, demonstrating its broad practicality.% The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习的透明度对临床诊断至关重要，但现有概念瓶颈方法仅依赖最终层特征，忽略了浅层和多尺度特征，缺乏有效的概念编码指导，阻碍了细粒度概念的提取。

Method: 提出概念提示和聚合(CoPA)框架，包括概念感知嵌入生成器(CEG)从视觉编码器各层提取概念表示，以及概念提示调优(CPT)引导模型放大关键概念相关视觉线索，最后聚合各层视觉表示与文本概念表示对齐。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的广泛实验结果表明，CoPA优于最先进的方法，有效捕获和利用了图像中宝贵的概念信息。

Conclusion: CoPA框架通过多层概念捕获和提示引导机制，显著提升了概念和疾病预测的性能，为临床诊断提供了更透明的决策过程。

Abstract: The transparency of deep learning models is essential for clinical
diagnostics. Concept Bottleneck Model provides clear decision-making processes
for diagnosis by transforming the latent space of black-box models into
human-understandable concepts. However, concept-based methods still face
challenges in concept capture capabilities. These methods often rely on encode
features solely from the final layer, neglecting shallow and multiscale
features, and lack effective guidance in concept encoding, hindering
fine-grained concept extraction. To address these issues, we introduce Concept
Prompting and Aggregating (CoPA), a novel framework designed to capture
multilayer concepts under prompt guidance. This framework utilizes the
Concept-aware Embedding Generator (CEG) to extract concept representations from
each layer of the visual encoder. Simultaneously, these representations serve
as prompts for Concept Prompt Tuning (CPT), steering the model towards
amplifying critical concept-related visual cues. Visual representations from
each layer are aggregated to align with textual concept representations. With
the proposed method, valuable concept-wise information in the images is
captured and utilized effectively, thus improving the performance of concept
and disease prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CoPA
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three public datasets. Code is

Motivation: 解决3D医学影像数据集规模增大和复杂性增加带来的协作研究和可转移性障碍。

Method: 在包含真实血管分割的大规模3D医学数据集上，应用ZFP压缩技术的误差容忍和固定速率两种模式，并与未压缩基线进行分割质量对比。

Result: ZFP在误差容忍模式下实现22.89:1的数据压缩比，平均Dice系数保持在0.87656的高水平，与未压缩基线的0.8774几乎相同。

Conclusion: ZFP是实现大规模医学数据集更高效和可访问研究的可行且强大的工具，有助于促进更广泛的社区合作。

Abstract: The increasing size and complexity of medical imaging datasets, particularly
in 3D formats, present significant barriers to collaborative research and
transferability. This study investigates whether the ZFP compression technique
can mitigate these challenges without compromising the performance of automated
cerebrovascular segmentation, a critical first step in intracranial aneurysm
detection. We apply ZFP in both its error tolerance and fixed-rate modes to a
large scale, and one of the most recent, datasets in the literature, 3D medical
dataset containing ground-truth vascular segmentations. The segmentation
quality on the compressed volumes is rigorously compared to the uncompressed
baseline (Dice approximately equals 0.8774). Our findings reveal that ZFP can
achieve substantial data reduction--up to a 22.89:1 ratio in error tolerance
mode--while maintaining a high degree of fidelity, with the mean Dice
coefficient remaining high at 0.87656. These results demonstrate that ZFP is a
viable and powerful tool for enabling more efficient and accessible research on
large-scale medical datasets, fostering broader collaboration across the
community.

Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在医学图像分割中多为任务特定，性能在不同模态和解剖区域间差异较大，且难以平衡模型复杂度和性能，特别是在需要高精度和高效率的临床环境中。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性和泛化能力上优于现有最先进方法，同时保持可比较的计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 该架构通过有效平衡效率和效果，为多样化医学成像任务提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has shown near-expert performance in
segmenting complex medical tissues and tumors. However, existing models are
often task-specific, with performance varying across modalities and anatomical
regions. Balancing model complexity and performance remains challenging,
particularly in clinical settings where both accuracy and efficiency are
critical. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid segmentation
architecture featuring a three-branch encoder that integrates CNNs,
Transformers, and a Mamba-based Attention Fusion (MAF) mechanism to capture
local, global, and long-range dependencies. A multi-scale attention-based CNN
decoder reconstructs fine-grained segmentation maps while preserving contextual
consistency. Additionally, a co-attention gate enhances feature selection by
emphasizing relevant spatial and semantic information across scales during both
encoding and decoding, improving feature interaction and cross-scale
communication. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that
our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and
generalization, while maintaining comparable computational complexity. By
effectively balancing efficiency and effectiveness, our architecture offers a
practical and scalable solution for diverse medical imaging tasks. Source code
and trained models will be publicly released upon acceptance to support
reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: Urban safety and infrastructure maintenance are critical components of smart
city development. Manual monitoring of road damages is time-consuming, highly
costly, and error-prone. This paper presents a deep learning approach for
automated road damage and manhole detection using the YOLOv9 algorithm with
polygonal annotations. Unlike traditional bounding box annotation, we employ
polygonal annotations for more precise localization of road defects. We develop
a novel dataset comprising more than one thousand images which are mostly
collected from Dhaka, Bangladesh. This dataset is used to train a YOLO-based
model for three classes, namely Broken, Not Broken, and Manhole. We achieve
78.1% overall image-level accuracy. The YOLOv9 model demonstrates strong
performance for Broken (86.7% F1-score) and Not Broken (89.2% F1-score)
classes, with challenges in Manhole detection (18.2% F1-score) due to class
imbalance. Our approach offers an efficient and scalable solution for
monitoring urban infrastructure in developing countries.

Motivation: 无配对图像翻译缺乏对齐样本，扩散模型能生成高质量多样化输出，对比学习能在无监督情况下学习语义相似性，两者结合适合无配对翻译任务。

Method: 使用时间相关对比学习训练模型，将图像与其域不变特征视为正样本对，然后用学习到的对比模型指导预训练SDE进行图像翻译。

Result: 在三个常见无配对图像翻译任务上与多个基线比较，使用四个评估指标，在多个指标上达到与最先进方法相当的结果，收敛速度显著更快且无需标签监督或分类器训练。

Conclusion: 该方法是无配对图像翻译任务中更高效的替代方案，结合了扩散模型和对比学习的优势。

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation involves learning mappings between source
domain and target domain in the absence of aligned or corresponding samples.
Score based diffusion models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in
generative tasks. Their ability to approximate complex data distributions
through stochastic differential equations (SDEs) enables them to generate
high-fidelity and diverse outputs, making them particularly well-suited for
unpaired I2I settings. In parallel, contrastive learning provides a powerful
framework for learning semantic similarities without the need for explicit
supervision or paired data. By pulling together representations of semantically
similar samples and pushing apart dissimilar ones, contrastive methods are
inherently aligned with the objectives of unpaired translation. Its ability to
selectively enforce semantic consistency at the feature level makes contrastive
learning particularly effective for guiding generation in unpaired scenarios.
In this work, we propose a time-dependent contrastive learning approach where a
model is trained with SimCLR by considering an image and its domain invarient
feature as a positive pair, enabling the preservation of domain-invariant
features and the discarding of domain-specific ones. The learned contrastive
model then guides the inference of a pretrained SDE for the I2I translation
task. We empirically compare Contrastive-SDE with several baselines across
three common unpaired I2I tasks, using four metrics for evaluation.
Constrastive-SDE achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art on several
metrics. Furthermore, we observe that our model converges significantly faster
and requires no label supervision or classifier training, making it a more
efficient alternative for this task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LIBERO基准测试存在训练和评估设置问题，导致性能估计虚高，无法公平比较模型。需要更严格的评估方法来检验模型的真实泛化能力。

Method: 在四个维度上引入合理扰动：操作对象、初始状态、任务指令和环境设置，系统评估模型在变化条件下的表现。

Result: 现有模型在标准LIBERO评估中达到90%以上准确率，但在LIBERO-PRO的泛化设置下性能崩溃到0.0%，显示模型严重依赖训练集的机械记忆。

Conclusion: 当前评估方法存在严重缺陷，呼吁社区放弃误导性方法，采用能真正评估模型泛化能力和理解力的鲁棒评估标准。

Abstract: LIBERO has emerged as a widely adopted benchmark for evaluating
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models; however, its current training and
evaluation settings are problematic, often leading to inflated performance
estimates and preventing fair model comparison. To address these issues, we
introduce LIBERO-PRO, an extended LIBERO benchmark that systematically
evaluates model performance under reasonable perturbations across four
dimensions: manipulated objects, initial states, task instructions, and
environments. Experimental results reveal that, although existing models
achieve over 90% accuracy under the standard LIBERO evaluation, their
performance collapses to 0.0% under our generalized setting. Crucially, this
discrepancy exposes the models' reliance on rote memorization of action
sequences and environment layouts from the training set, rather than genuine
task understanding or environmental perception. For instance, models persist in
executing grasping actions when the target object is replaced with irrelevant
items, and their outputs remain unchanged even when given corrupted
instructions or even messy tokens. These findings expose the severe flaws in
current evaluation practices, and we call on the community to abandon
misleading methodologies in favor of robust assessments of model generalization
and comprehension. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 当前AI生成图像越来越难以被标准检测器识别，但人类仍能区分。研究旨在解决检测器与人类判断之间的差异，并探索大型视觉语言模型在可解释AI图像检测中的应用。

Method: 构建Mirage数据集（包含各种有可见伪影的AI生成图像），并研究大型视觉语言模型在AI图像检测任务中的表现。

Result: 大型视觉语言模型能有效检测有可见伪影的AI生成图像，但在处理无伪影图像时性能下降。

Conclusion: 大型视觉语言模型在AI图像检测方面有潜力，特别是对于有可见伪影的图像，但对高质量无伪影图像的检测仍需改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models have led to models that produce
synthetic images that are increasingly difficult for standard AI detectors to
identify, even though they often remain distinguishable by humans. To identify
this discrepancy, we introduce \textbf{Mirage}, a curated dataset comprising a
diverse range of AI-generated images exhibiting visible artifacts, where
current state-of-the-art detection methods largely fail. Furthermore, we
investigate whether Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which are
increasingly employed as substitutes for human judgment in various tasks, can
be leveraged for explainable AI image detection. Our experiments on both Mirage
and existing benchmark datasets demonstrate that while LVLMs are highly
effective at detecting AI-generated images with visible artifacts, their
performance declines when confronted with images lacking such cues.

*Rui Qian,Xin Yin,Chuanhang Deng,Zhiyuan Peng,Jian Xiong,Wei Zhai,Dejing Dou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UGround提出了一种统一的视觉定位范式，通过动态选择Transformer中间层作为“mask as prompt”，解决了传统方法依赖固定最后一层和“<SEG>作为prompt”的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法存在两个主要问题：(1)依赖固定最后一层隐藏层，逐层传播累积误差；(2)使用<SEG>作为prompt，将文本嵌入隐式投影到视觉空间而缺乏明确的空间线索。

Method: 采用Policy-Prompted Masking方法，包含两个关键组件：Stochastic Skip Connection（SSC）通过强化学习策略让<SEG>token在Transformer层间滑动选择连接点；Mask as Prompt（MasP）使用相似度图作为软logit掩码来提示SAM生成掩码。

Result: UGround首次在单一框架内统一了从传统参考表达式分割到推理分割、单目标到多目标、正查询到错误前提（空目标）的视觉定位任务。

Conclusion: UGround通过动态层选择和mask作为prompt的方法，有效解决了传统视觉定位方法的局限性，提供了一种更灵活和准确的统一视觉定位框架。

Abstract: We present UGround, a \textbf{U}nified visual \textbf{Ground}ing paradigm
that dynamically selects intermediate layers across \textbf{U}nrolled
transformers as ``mask as prompt'', diverging from the prevailing pipeline that
leverages the fixed last hidden layer as ``\texttt{<SEG>} as prompt''. UGround
addresses two primary challenges posed by the prevailing paradigm: (1) its
reliance on the fixed last hidden layer, which sequentially amplifies
cumulative errors arising from layer-by-layer propagation without intermediate
correction, and (2) its use of \texttt{<SEG>} as a prompt, which implicitly
projects textual embeddings into visual space without explicit spatial cues
(\eg, coordinates). Central to UGround is Policy-Prompted Masking, which
comprises two key components: Stochastic Skip Connection (SSC) and Mask as
Prompt (MasP). SSC is a reinforcement learning policy that, via stochastic
sampling, allows each \texttt{<SEG>} token to slide across unrolled transformer
layers, enabling dynamic layer selection at which it connects to the vision
model (\eg, SAM) in a skip-connection fashion. Given the selected hidden layer,
MasP uses the similarity map derived from the \texttt{<SEG>} token and image
tokens as a soft logit mask to prompt SAM for mask generation, offering
explicit spatial cues through its activation regions. To validate the
effectiveness of UGround, we, for the first time, have unified visual grounding
within a single framework from an attribute perspective, spanning from
traditional refer expression segmentation to newly proposed reasoning
segmentation, single-target to multi-target, positive query to false premise
(empty target). All codes and models are publicly available at

TL;DR: OMG4是一个优化的4D高斯泼溅框架，通过三阶段渐进式剪枝（采样、剪枝、合并）和隐式外观压缩，显著减少模型存储开销，在保持重建质量的同时将模型大小减少60%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D高斯泼溅在动态场景表示中面临存储开销大的挑战，现有方法在压缩比或视觉质量方面存在限制，需要开发更高效的压缩方法。

Method: 采用三阶段渐进式剪枝：高斯采样识别关键基元、高斯剪枝去除冗余、高斯合并融合相似基元；结合隐式外观压缩和广义子向量量化技术。

Result: 在标准基准数据集上的实验表明，OMG4显著优于现有最先进方法，模型大小减少超过60%的同时保持重建质量。

Conclusion: OMG4是紧凑4D场景表示的重要进展，为广泛应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: 4D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a new paradigm for dynamic scene
representation, enabling real-time rendering of scenes with complex motions.
However, it faces a major challenge of storage overhead, as millions of
Gaussians are required for high-fidelity reconstruction. While several studies
have attempted to alleviate this memory burden, they still face limitations in
compression ratio or visual quality. In this work, we present OMG4 (Optimized
Minimal 4D Gaussian Splatting), a framework that constructs a compact set of
salient Gaussians capable of faithfully representing 4D Gaussian models. Our
method progressively prunes Gaussians in three stages: (1) Gaussian Sampling to
identify primitives critical to reconstruction fidelity, (2) Gaussian Pruning
to remove redundancies, and (3) Gaussian Merging to fuse primitives with
similar characteristics. In addition, we integrate implicit appearance
compression and generalize Sub-Vector Quantization (SVQ) to 4D representations,
further reducing storage while preserving quality. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that OMG4 significantly outperforms
recent state-of-the-art methods, reducing model sizes by over 60% while
maintaining reconstruction quality. These results position OMG4 as a
significant step forward in compact 4D scene representation, opening new
possibilities for a wide range of applications. Our source code is available at

*Jyoti Kini,Rohit Gupta,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的开放词汇目标检测框架，通过结构化领域对齐将地面视图的预训练模型知识迁移到航空图像领域，解决了跨域检测的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测模型在固定类别集上训练，缺乏灵活性且难以扩展新类别。航空图像与地面视图存在领域偏移、视角变化和尺度差异，直接知识迁移效果不佳。

Method: 采用对比性图像-图像对齐增强航空与地面视图嵌入的相似性，并使用多实例词汇关联将航空图像与文本嵌入对齐。

Result: 在xView、DOTAv2、VisDrone、DIOR和HRRSD数据集上的实验验证，零样本设置下在DOTAv2上提升+6.32 mAP，VisDrone上+4.16 mAP，HRRSD上+3.46 mAP。

Conclusion: 该方法为航空应用中的目标检测系统提供了更灵活和可扩展的解决方案，显著优于微调的封闭词汇模型。

Abstract: Traditional object detection models are typically trained on a fixed set of
classes, limiting their flexibility and making it costly to incorporate new
categories. Open-vocabulary object detection addresses this limitation by
enabling models to identify unseen classes without explicit training.
Leveraging pretrained models contrastively trained on abundantly available
ground-view image-text classification pairs provides a strong foundation for
open-vocabulary object detection in aerial imagery. Domain shifts, viewpoint
variations, and extreme scale differences make direct knowledge transfer across
domains ineffective, requiring specialized adaptation strategies. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework for adapting open-vocabulary
representations from ground-view images to solve object detection in aerial
imagery through structured domain alignment. The method introduces contrastive
image-to-image alignment to enhance the similarity between aerial and
ground-view embeddings and employs multi-instance vocabulary associations to
align aerial images with text embeddings. Extensive experiments on the xView,
DOTAv2, VisDrone, DIOR, and HRRSD datasets are used to validate our approach.
Our open-vocabulary model achieves improvements of +6.32 mAP on DOTAv2, +4.16
mAP on VisDrone (Images), and +3.46 mAP on HRRSD in the zero-shot setting when
compared to finetuned closed-vocabulary dataset-specific model performance,
thus paving the way for more flexible and scalable object detection systems in
aerial applications.

Conclusion: SDAKD通过引入学生判别器有效解决了GAN知识蒸馏中的容量不匹配问题，为资源受限设备上的GAN部署提供了有效的压缩方案

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) achieve excellent performance in
generative tasks, such as image super-resolution, but their computational
requirements make difficult their deployment on resource-constrained devices.
While knowledge distillation is a promising research direction for GAN
compression, effectively training a smaller student generator is challenging
due to the capacity mismatch between the student generator and the teacher
discriminator. In this work, we propose Student Discriminator Assisted
Knowledge Distillation (SDAKD), a novel GAN distillation methodology that
introduces a student discriminator to mitigate this capacity mismatch. SDAKD
follows a three-stage training strategy, and integrates an adapted feature map
distillation approach in its last two training stages. We evaluated SDAKD on
two well-performing super-resolution GANs, GCFSR and Real-ESRGAN. Our
experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over the baselines and SOTA GAN
knowledge distillation methods. The SDAKD source code will be made openly
available upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Diagnosing ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) requires a
comprehensive analysis of both head pose and ocular movements. However,
existing datasets focus on these aspects separately, limiting the development
of integrated diagnostic approaches and restricting AI-driven advancements in
AHP analysis. To address this gap, we introduce PoseGaze-AHP, a novel 3D
dataset that synchronously captures head pose and gaze movement information for
ocular-induced AHP assessment. Structured clinical data were extracted from
medical literature using large language models (LLMs) through an iterative
process with the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, combining stepwise, hierarchical, and
complex prompting strategies. The extracted records were systematically imputed
and transformed into 3D representations using the Neural Head Avatar (NHA)
framework. The dataset includes 7,920 images generated from two head textures,
covering a broad spectrum of ocular conditions. The extraction method achieved
an overall accuracy of 91.92%, demonstrating its reliability for clinical
dataset construction. PoseGaze-AHP is the first publicly available resource
tailored for AI-driven ocular-induced AHP diagnosis, supporting the development
of accurate and privacy-compliant diagnostic tools.

TL;DR: 本文提出了DHQA-4D数据集和DynaMesh-Rater方法，用于动态4D数字人网格的质量评估。DHQA-4D包含32个高质量4D人体网格序列和1920个失真样本，DynaMesh-Rater通过提取视觉、运动和几何特征，利用大语言模型进行质量评分。


<details>

Motivation: 随着3D扫描和重建技术的发展，动态数字人化身应用日益广泛，但在采集、压缩和传输过程中容易受到各种噪声影响，影响用户体验，因此需要有效的质量评估方法。

Method: 首先构建DHQA-4D数据集，包含真实扫描的4D人体网格序列及其失真版本。然后提出DynaMesh-Rater方法，从投影的2D视频提取视觉特征，从裁剪视频片段提取运动特征，从4D网格提取几何特征，最后利用大语言模型集成这些多维特征，通过LoRA指令调优预测质量分数。

Conclusion: 该研究为动态4D数字人网格的质量评估提供了有效的数据集和方法，能够准确评估纹理和非纹理4D网格的质量。

Abstract: With the rapid development of 3D scanning and reconstruction technologies,
dynamic digital human avatars based on 4D meshes have become increasingly
popular. A high-precision dynamic digital human avatar can be applied to
various fields such as game production, animation generation, and remote
immersive communication. However, these 4D human avatar meshes are prone to
being degraded by various types of noise during the processes of collection,
compression, and transmission, thereby affecting the viewing experience of
users. In light of this fact, quality assessment of dynamic 4D digital humans
becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we first propose a large-scale
dynamic digital human quality assessment dataset, DHQA-4D, which contains 32
high-quality real-scanned 4D human mesh sequences, 1920 distorted textured 4D
human meshes degraded by 11 textured distortions, as well as their
corresponding textured and non-textured mean opinion scores (MOSs). Equipped
with DHQA-4D dataset, we analyze the influence of different types of distortion
on human perception for textured dynamic 4D meshes and non-textured dynamic 4D
meshes. Additionally, we propose DynaMesh-Rater, a novel large multimodal model
(LMM) based approach that is able to assess both textured 4D meshes and
non-textured 4D meshes. Concretely, DynaMesh-Rater elaborately extracts
multi-dimensional features, including visual features from a projected 2D
video, motion features from cropped video clips, and geometry features from the
4D human mesh to provide comprehensive quality-related information. Then we
utilize a LMM model to integrate the multi-dimensional features and conduct a
LoRA-based instruction tuning technique to teach the LMM model to predict the
quality scores. Extensive experimental results on the DHQA-4D dataset
demonstrate the superiority of our DynaMesh-Rater method over previous quality
assessment methods.

Method: 改进ResNet-50模型，采用自适应空间特征融合机制，通过双分支设计融合高层语义特征和中层细节特征，使用全局平均池化和全连接层生成自适应权重进行加权融合。

Result: 在ISIC 2020数据集子集(3297张图像)上，模型达到93.18%准确率，AUC值在P-R和ROC曲线上分别为0.9670和0.9717，优于5种经典CNN模型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自适应特征融合有效提升了皮肤癌分类性能，Grad-CAM验证显示模型能聚焦病变相关区域，为计算机辅助皮肤癌诊断提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Skin cancer classification remains a challenging problem due to high
inter-class similarity, intra-class variability, and image noise in dermoscopic
images. To address these issues, we propose an improved ResNet-50 model
enhanced with Adaptive Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF), which adaptively
integrates multi-scale semantic and surface features to improve feature
representation and reduce overfitting. The ResNet-50 model is enhanced with an
adaptive feature fusion mechanism to achieve more effective multi-scale feature
extraction and improve overall performance. Specifically, a dual-branch design
fuses high-level semantic and mid-level detail features, which are processed
through global average pooling and fully connected layers to generate adaptive
weights for weighted fusion, thereby strengthening feature learning and
reducing the impact of noise on classification. The method is evaluated on a
subset of the ISIC 2020 dataset containing 3297 benign and malignant skin
lesion images. Experimental results show that the proposed ASFF-based ResNet-50
achieves the best overall performance compared with 5 classic convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) models. The proposed model reached an accuracy of 93.18%
along with higher precision, recall, specificity, and F1 score. The improved
model achieves an AUC value of 0.9670 and 0.9717 in the P-R and ROC curve,
respectively. Then, the evaluation based on Grad-CAM further proved that the
improved model adaptively focuses on lesion-relevant regions while suppressing
irrelevant background information, thereby validating its enhanced feature
learning capability from a deep representation perspective. These findings
demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a more effective and efficient
solution for computer-aided skin cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: Aims Late diagnosis of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) contributes
significantly to its high global mortality rate, with over 50\% of cases
detected at advanced stages and a 5-year survival rate below 50\% according to
WHO statistics. This study aims to improve early detection of OSCC by
developing a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates clinical,
radiological, and histopathological images using a weighted ensemble of
DenseNet-121 convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Material and Methods A
retrospective study was conducted using publicly available datasets
representing three distinct medical imaging modalities. Each modality-specific
dataset was used to train a DenseNet-121 CNN via transfer learning.
Augmentation and modality-specific preprocessing were applied to increase
robustness. Predictions were fused using a validation-weighted ensemble
strategy. Evaluation was performed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
Results High validation accuracy was achieved for radiological (100\%) and
histopathological (95.12\%) modalities, with clinical images performing lower
(63.10\%) due to visual heterogeneity. The ensemble model demonstrated improved
diagnostic robustness with an overall accuracy of 84.58\% on a multimodal
validation dataset of 55 samples. Conclusion The multimodal ensemble framework
bridges gaps in the current diagnostic workflow by offering a non-invasive,
AI-assisted triage tool that enhances early identification of high-risk
lesions. It supports clinicians in decision-making, aligning with global
oncology guidelines to reduce diagnostic delays and improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of powerful multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), explainable image quality assessment (IQA) has
gradually become popular, aiming at providing quality-related descriptions and
answers of images. To achieve this goal, recent methods seek to construct a
large-scale instruction tuning dataset to empower the MLLM with quality
perception ability following the well-known scaling law. However, a large
amount of instruction tuning data may cause substantial computational costs and
redundant data, which in turn will cause harm to the performance of the model.
To cope with this problem, in this paper, we challenge the scaling law and
systematically investigate the role of data quality of the instruction tuning
dataset for explainable IQA. Using a powerful pre-trained MLLM, we first
investigate the changes in model performance after fine-tuning with different
sizes of instruction tuning data. We find that selecting a subset of the data
set randomly using an appropriate ratio can even lead to better results than
training with the entire instruction tuning dataset, demonstrating the
redundancy of current explainable IQA instruction tuning data. Beyond randomly
sampling a subset, we propose a clustering-based data selection framework with
three stages: clustering feature extraction, cluster quota allocation, and
cluster sampling strategy. Then we systematically analyze the choices of each
stage and propose a simple but efficient data selection method IQA-Select for
explainable IQA. The experimental results demonstrate that IQA-Select can
achieve 102.1% and 103.7% performance of full fine-tuning using only 10%
selected data in Q-Bench and AesBench respectively, significantly reducing
computational costs while achieving better performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VLA模型由于数据稀缺和领域狭窄而泛化能力差，双系统方法又受到动作模块语义模糊的限制，需要在新环境中重新微调。

Method: VLM生成粗略3D路径点，通用动作专家通过采样实时点云观测将其细化为密集可执行动作序列，采用"动作预训练、点云微调"的训练范式。

Result: 结合了VLM在视觉理解和规划方面的广泛泛化能力与动作专家在动作级别的精细泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了VLM在物理世界中部署的挑战，实现了更好的跨任务训练和泛化性能。

Abstract: Although Vision-Language Models (VLM) have demonstrated impressive planning
and reasoning capabilities, translating these abilities into the physical world
introduces significant challenges. Conventional Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models, which integrate reasoning and action into a monolithic architecture,
generalize poorly because they are constrained by scarce, narrow-domain data.
While recent dual-system approaches attempt to decouple "thinking" from
"acting", they are often constrained by semantic ambiguities within the action
module. This ambiguity makes large-scale, cross-task training infeasible.
Consequently, these systems typically necessitate fine-tuning on newly
collected data when deployed to novel environments, and the cooperation
mechanism between the two systems remains ill-defined. To address these
limitations, we introduce, for the first time, a framework centered around a
generalizable action expert. Our approach utilizes sparse 3D trajectories as an
intermediate representation, effectively bridging the high-level planning
capabilities of the VLM with the low-level physical action module. During the
planning phase, the VLM is only required to generate coarse 3D waypoints. These
waypoints are then processed by our generalizable action expert, which refines
them into dense, executable action sequences by sampling real-time point cloud
observations of the environment. To promote training efficiency and robust
generalization, we introduce a novel "Action Pre-training, Pointcloud
Fine-tuning" paradigm. Our method combines the broad generalization
capabilities of VLMs in visual understanding and planning with the
fine-grained, action-level generalization of action expert.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance

intervention technique. We also address a key limitation in existing datasets
by developing more comprehensive and precise class description benchmarks. We
validate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experimentation
across multiple fine-grained image classification benchmarks. Our proposed

Motivation: 雾天条件下自动驾驶感知系统性能下降，现有去雾方法在图像保真度上的改进并不总能转化为更好的检测和分割性能，且缺乏真实世界可迁移性的评估。

Method: 使用Foggy Cityscapes数据集，评估包括经典滤波器、现代去雾网络、链式变体和VLM图像编辑模型在内的综合管道，分析图像质量和下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 建立了透明、任务导向的去雾方法基准，明确了预处理在恶劣天气下真正改善自动驾驶感知的条件。

Abstract: Autonomous driving perception systems are particularly vulnerable in foggy
conditions, where light scattering reduces contrast and obscures fine details
critical for safe operation. While numerous defogging methods exist-from
handcrafted filters to learned restoration models-improvements in image
fidelity do not consistently translate into better downstream detection and
segmentation. Moreover, prior evaluations often rely on synthetic data, leaving
questions about real-world transferability. We present a structured empirical
study that benchmarks a comprehensive set of pipelines, including (i) classical
filters, (ii) modern defogging networks, (iii) chained variants
(filter$\rightarrow$model, model$\rightarrow$filter), and (iv) prompt-driven
visual--language image editing models (VLM) applied directly to foggy images.
Using Foggy Cityscapes, we assess both image quality and downstream performance
on object detection (mAP) and segmentation (PQ, RQ, SQ). Our analysis reveals
when defogging helps, when chaining yields synergy or degradation, and how
VLM-based editors compare to dedicated approaches. In addition, we evaluate
qualitative rubric-based scores from a VLM judge and quantify their alignment
with task metrics, showing strong correlations with mAP. Together, these
results establish a transparent, task-oriented benchmark for defogging methods
and highlight the conditions under which preprocessing genuinely improves
autonomous perception in adverse weather.

Conclusion: CAMEO框架成功实现了通用人体运动视频生成，通过级联设计和相机感知模块提高了生成视频的连贯性并减少了人工干预。

Abstract: Human video generation is becoming an increasingly important task with broad
applications in graphics, entertainment, and embodied AI. Despite the rapid
progress of video diffusion models (VDMs), their use for general-purpose human
video generation remains underexplored, with most works constrained to
image-to-video setups or narrow domains like dance videos. In this work, we
propose CAMEO, a cascaded framework for general human motion video generation.
It seamlessly bridges Text-to-Motion (T2M) models and conditional VDMs,
mitigating suboptimal factors that may arise in this process across both
training and inference through carefully designed components. Specifically, we
analyze and prepare both textual prompts and visual conditions to effectively
train the VDM, ensuring robust alignment between motion descriptions,
conditioning signals, and the generated videos. Furthermore, we introduce a
camera-aware conditioning module that connects the two stages, automatically
selecting viewpoints aligned with the input text to enhance coherence and
reduce manual intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on
both the MovieGen benchmark and a newly introduced benchmark tailored to the
T2M-VDM combination, while highlighting its versatility across diverse use
cases.

TL;DR: OpenFLAME是一个联邦视觉定位系统，通过分布式方式让各组织独立维护自己的3D扫描和VPS服务，解决集中式VPS在隐私、监管和维护方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集中式VPS无法覆盖私人室内空间，存在隐私担忧、监管限制和维护瓶颈。需要一种分布式解决方案来支持更大范围的AR应用。

Method: 采用联邦图像定位概念，各组织独立维护VPS服务，通过参考解决方案管理和合并跨地图数据而不共享私有数据。

Result: 实现了分布式VPS后端，支持访问控制、分布式维护和更大覆盖范围。

Conclusion: 联邦VPS方法能够解决集中式系统的局限性，为世界级AR应用提供可行的定位后端解决方案。

Abstract: World-scale augmented reality (AR) applications need a ubiquitous 6DoF
localization backend to anchor content to the real world consistently across
devices. Large organizations such as Google and Niantic are 3D scanning outdoor
public spaces in order to build their own Visual Positioning Systems (VPS).
These centralized VPS solutions fail to meet the needs of many future AR
applications -- they do not cover private indoor spaces because of privacy
concerns, regulations, and the labor bottleneck of updating and maintaining 3D
scans. In this paper, we present OpenFLAME, a federated VPS backend that allows
independent organizations to 3D scan and maintain a separate VPS service for
their own spaces. This enables access control of indoor 3D scans, distributed
maintenance of the VPS backend, and encourages larger coverage. Sharding of VPS
services introduces several unique challenges -- coherency of localization
results across spaces, quality control of VPS services, selection of the right
VPS service for a location, and many others. We introduce the concept of
federated image-based localization and provide reference solutions for managing
and merging data across maps without sharing private data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统未能将生物力学洞察与对球员和教练有意义且可操作的语言反馈联系起来，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用CNN-LSTM模型从运动数据中提取关键生物力学特征（如关节角度、肢体速度和动力链模式），并利用大型语言模型基于这些特征生成反馈。

Result: 该方法在THETIS数据集上进行了评估，重点关注分类性能和可解释性，旨在弥合可解释AI与运动生物力学之间的差距。

Conclusion: 该框架成功地将生物力学特征与可操作的语言反馈相结合，为网球击球分析提供了技术上准确且对最终用户有意义的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated tennis stroke analysis has advanced significantly with the
integration of biomechanical motion cues alongside deep learning techniques,
enhancing stroke classification accuracy and player performance evaluation.
Despite these advancements, existing systems often fail to connect
biomechanical insights with actionable language feedback that is both
accessible and meaningful to players and coaches. This research project
addresses this gap by developing a novel framework that extracts key
biomechanical features (such as joint angles, limb velocities, and kinetic
chain patterns) from motion data using Convolutional Neural Network Long
Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM)-based models. These features are analyzed for
relationships influencing stroke effectiveness and injury risk, forming the
basis for feedback generation using large language models (LLMs). Leveraging
the THETIS dataset and feature extraction techniques, our approach aims to
produce feedback that is technically accurate, biomechanically grounded, and
actionable for end-users. The experimental setup evaluates this framework on
classification performance and interpretability, bridging the gap between
explainable AI and sports biomechanics.

TL;DR: TimeWarp方法通过创建针对性的合成时间数据集来改进视频大语言模型的细粒度时间理解能力，在七个基准测试中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频大语言模型在需要细粒度时间理解的任务上表现不佳，主要原因是微调数据集缺乏视觉复杂性和时间细节，导致模型过度依赖语言推理而非真正理解视频动态。

Method: 提出了TimeWarp方法，系统性地创建针对性的合成时间数据集，并构建了一个大规模偏好数据集来捕捉常被忽略的复杂时间动态，将模型响应锚定到视觉和时间信息上。

Result: 该方法应用于现有模型后，在时间理解基准测试中显著提升了性能，在七个基准测试中都取得了绝对性能改进。

Conclusion: TimeWarp方法通过针对性数据集有效提升了视频大语言模型的时间理解能力，证明了所提数据集在推进视频大语言模型时间理解方面的有效性。

Abstract: While Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance across general video understanding benchmarks-particularly in video
captioning and descriptive tasks-they consistently underperform on tasks that
require fine-grained temporal understanding. This limitation arises due to the
lack of visual complexity and temporal nuance in current fine-tuning datasets,
leading these models to rely heavily on language-based reasoning rather than
truly understanding video dynamics. In this work, we propose TimeWarp, a
systematic method to create a targeted synthetic temporal dataset to fine-tune
the model's responses to encourage it to focus on the given input video. We
introduce a large-scale preference dataset, created using TimeWarp, that
captures intricate temporal dynamics often overlooked, grounding the model's
responses to visual and temporal information. We demonstrate that when our
method is applied to existing models, it significantly improves performance on
temporal understanding benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of our
proposed datasets in advancing temporal understanding in Video-LLMs, resulting
in an absolute improvement in performance across seven benchmarks. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了在生物医学视觉语言模型中扩展文本编码器上下文长度的影响，发现更长的上下文能带来更好的检索和分类性能，并提出了BIOMEDICA-LongCAP数据集和BMC-LongCLIP模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型通常使用短文本窗口（<77个token）进行预训练，这导致长格式生物医学标题被截断。然而，大规模开源文献中的生物医学标题有很大部分远超77个token，因此需要研究长上下文预训练的影响。

Method: 通过扩展视觉语言模型中文本编码器的上下文长度，创建了BIOMEDICA-LongCAP数据集（包含100万张图像-标题对），并训练了BMC-LongCLIP模型，该模型的文本编码器支持最多512个token的窗口。

Result: BMC-LongCLIP将上下文容量扩展了6.6倍，token浪费从55%减少到2.2%。在长标题检索基准测试中，Recall@1获得了高达30%的绝对增益，分类平均提升2%，且收敛速度比短上下文模型更快。

Conclusion: 长上下文建模是推进生物医学视觉语言模型发展的一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Embedding vision-language models (VLMs) are typically pretrained with short
text windows (<77 tokens), which forces the truncation of long-format captions.
Yet, the distribution of biomedical captions from large-scale open source
literature reveals that a huge portion of captions far exceed 77 tokens. To
this end, we investigate the impact of pretraining on long-format biomedical
captions by extending the context length of text encoders in VLMs. We find that
longer context (thus, enabling additional supervision provided in long-format
captions) correlates with better retrieval and classification performance.
Given this finding, we introduce BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, a dataset of 1M
image-caption pairs enriched with context-aware descriptions from full-text
articles, providing longer and additional textual supervision. Using
BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, we train BMC-LongCLIP, a long-context biomedical VLM with a
text encoder supporting windows of up to 512 tokens. Our model extends context
capacity by 6.6x, reducing token waste from 55% to just 2.2%. On long-caption
retrieval benchmarks, BMC-LongCLIP achieves up to +30% absolute gains in
Recall@1 and +2% average improvements in classification, while also converging
faster than short-context. Our results demonstrate that long-context modeling
is a promising direction for advancing biomedical VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长尾半监督学习方法假设未标记数据遵循预定义分布，但实际上未标记数据的分布通常是未知且任意的，这限制了现有方法的性能。

Method: 采用可控自增强优化循环：动态可控过滤机制选择可靠伪标签，基于更新后标记数据分布构建贝叶斯最优分类器，结合类感知自适应增强模块和辅助分支最大化数据利用。

Result: 在多个常用基准数据集上的综合评估显示，CPG实现了持续改进，在准确率上比最先进方法高出最多15.97%。

Conclusion: CPG框架能有效处理未标记数据分布未知的长尾半监督学习问题，通过可控伪标签生成和优化循环显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Current long-tailed semi-supervised learning methods assume that labeled data
exhibit a long-tailed distribution, and unlabeled data adhere to a typical
predefined distribution (i.e., long-tailed, uniform, or inverse long-tailed).
However, the distribution of the unlabeled data is generally unknown and may
follow an arbitrary distribution. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
Controllable Pseudo-label Generation (CPG) framework, expanding the labeled
dataset with the progressively identified reliable pseudo-labels from the
unlabeled dataset and training the model on the updated labeled dataset with a
known distribution, making it unaffected by the unlabeled data distribution.
Specifically, CPG operates through a controllable self-reinforcing optimization
cycle: (i) at each training step, our dynamic controllable filtering mechanism
selectively incorporates reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset into
the labeled dataset, ensuring that the updated labeled dataset follows a known
distribution; (ii) we then construct a Bayes-optimal classifier using logit
adjustment based on the updated labeled data distribution; (iii) this improved
classifier subsequently helps identify more reliable pseudo-labels in the next
training step. We further theoretically prove that this optimization cycle can
significantly reduce the generalization error under some conditions.
Additionally, we propose a class-aware adaptive augmentation module to further
improve the representation of minority classes, and an auxiliary branch to
maximize data utilization by leveraging all labeled and unlabeled samples.
Comprehensive evaluations on various commonly used benchmark datasets show that
CPG achieves consistent improvements, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up
to \textbf{15.97\%} in accuracy. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OCR系统在处理越南历史文献中的汉喃文本时，面临扫描质量差、字形不标准和手写变体等挑战，需要改进识别性能。

Method: 使用精选的越南古代汉喃手稿数据集，对PaddleOCRv5的文本识别模块进行微调，建立完整的训练流程包括预处理、LMDB转换、评估和可视化。

Result: 微调后模型准确率显著提升，精确准确率从37.5%提高到50.0%，在噪声图像条件下表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了汉喃文本识别性能，并开发了交互式演示工具，支持汉越语义对齐、机器翻译和历史语言学研究等下游应用。

Abstract: Recognizing and processing Classical Chinese (Han-Nom) texts play a vital
role in digitizing Vietnamese historical documents and enabling cross-lingual
semantic research. However, existing OCR systems struggle with degraded scans,
non-standard glyphs, and handwriting variations common in ancient sources. In
this work, we propose a fine-tuning approach for PaddleOCRv5 to improve
character recognition on Han-Nom texts. We retrain the text recognition module
using a curated subset of ancient Vietnamese Chinese manuscripts, supported by
a full training pipeline covering preprocessing, LMDB conversion, evaluation,
and visualization. Experimental results show a significant improvement over the
base model, with exact accuracy increasing from 37.5 percent to 50.0 percent,
particularly under noisy image conditions. Furthermore, we develop an
interactive demo that visually compares pre- and post-fine-tuning recognition
results, facilitating downstream applications such as Han-Vietnamese semantic
alignment, machine translation, and historical linguistics research. The demo

TL;DR: MetaSeg是一个基于元学习的隐式神经表示框架，用于医学图像分割，能够在参数减少90%的情况下达到与U-Net相当的Dice分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式神经表示(INRs)在信号表示方面表现出色，但不适用于需要学习语义结构的预测任务如分割。MetaSeg旨在解决这一问题，为医学图像分割提供轻量级解决方案。

Method: 使用一个基础INR同时预测像素强度值和类别标签，通过元学习过程在训练数据集上找到最优初始参数，使得INR只需微调即可适应新图像并自动解码类别标签。

Result: 在2D和3D脑MRI分割任务中，MetaSeg的Dice分数与常用U-Net模型相当，但参数数量减少了90%。

Conclusion: MetaSeg为医学图像分割提供了一个新颖、可扩展的轻量级替代方案，相比传统的U-Net和视觉变换器架构更加资源高效。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have achieved remarkable successes in
learning expressive yet compact signal representations. However, they are not
naturally amenable to predictive tasks such as segmentation, where they must
learn semantic structures over a distribution of signals. In this study, we
introduce MetaSeg, a meta-learning framework to train INRs for medical image
segmentation. MetaSeg uses an underlying INR that simultaneously predicts per
pixel intensity values and class labels. It then uses a meta-learning procedure
to find optimal initial parameters for this INR over a training dataset of
images and segmentation maps, such that the INR can simply be fine-tuned to fit
pixels of an unseen test image, and automatically decode its class labels. We
evaluated MetaSeg on 2D and 3D brain MRI segmentation tasks and report Dice
scores comparable to commonly used U-Net models, but with $90\%$ fewer
parameters. MetaSeg offers a fresh, scalable alternative to traditional
resource-heavy architectures such as U-Nets and vision transformers for medical
image segmentation. Our project is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频问答中计算效率低下的问题，传统方法需要处理大量帧，而ViTL通过智能定位和token重新分配来优化计算资源使用。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 使用低帧率浏览定位问题相关时间片段 2) 在高有效帧率下通过span感知的token重新分配进行问答，采用端到端训练和交错的组相对目标函数。

Result: 在固定token预算下，ViTL在长视频问答和时间定位任务上性能提升达8.6%，同时减少50%的帧输入，span感知的token重新分配始终优于均匀采样。

Conclusion: ViTL和配套数据集提供了一个可解释、计算高效的解决方案，为可扩展的长视频问答提供了有效方法。

Abstract: We present \emph{Video-in-the-Loop} (ViTL), a two-stage long-video QA
framework that preserves a fixed token budget by first \emph{localizing}
question-relevant interval(s) with a low-fps skim and then \emph{answering} via
span-aware reallocation of visual tokens at higher effective frame rate,
emitting an interleaved output with both spans and the final option for direct
attribution. We also introduce \dataname{}, which converts description based
event graphs into \emph{span-grounded} multiple-choice QA by pairing each
question with \emph{ground-truth} time span(s) and related reasoning. ViTL is
trained end-to-end with an interleaved group-relative objective that couples
temporal IoU for localization with answer correctness, allowing credit to flow
from answers back to spans without increasing compute. Under fixed token
budgets, ViTL attains up to 8.6% with 50% less frame input on long-video QA and
temporal grounding (e.g., Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions) and ablations
show that span-aware token reallocation consistently surpasses uniform
sampling. Together, \dataname{} and ViTL provide an interpretable,
compute-efficient recipe for scalable long-video QA.

Motivation: 现有假新闻视频检测器主要依赖基于模式的特征，但训练数据有限且多样性不足导致模式偏见，影响性能。现实世界中视频素材与虚假新闻事件存在复杂多对多关系，现有数据集未能充分反映这种关系。

Method: AgentAug框架实现四种伪造类别的LLM驱动流水线来模拟新闻视频创作过程，结合基于不确定度采样的主动学习策略选择有用的增强样本。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，AgentAug持续提升了短视频假新闻检测器的性能。

Conclusion: AgentAug通过数据增强有效解决了假新闻视频检测中训练数据不足和多样性缺乏的问题，提高了检测器的泛化能力。

Abstract: The emergence of fake news on short video platforms has become a new
significant societal concern, necessitating automatic video-news-specific
detection. Current detectors primarily rely on pattern-based features to
separate fake news videos from real ones. However, limited and less diversified
training data lead to biased patterns and hinder their performance. This
weakness stems from the complex many-to-many relationships between video
material segments and fabricated news events in real-world scenarios: a single
video clip can be utilized in multiple ways to create different fake
narratives, while a single fabricated event often combines multiple distinct
video segments. However, existing datasets do not adequately reflect such
relationships due to the difficulty of collecting and annotating large-scale
real-world data, resulting in sparse coverage and non-comprehensive learning of
the characteristics of potential fake news video creation. To address this
issue, we propose a data augmentation framework, AgentAug, that generates
diverse fake news videos by simulating typical creative processes. AgentAug
implements multiple LLM-driven pipelines of four fabrication categories for
news video creation, combined with an active learning strategy based on
uncertainty sampling to select the potentially useful augmented samples during
training. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that
AgentAug consistently improves the performance of short video fake news
detectors.

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing have shifted from manual pixel manipulation
to employing deep learning methods like stable diffusion models, which now
leverage cross-attention mechanisms for text-driven control. This transition
has simplified the editing process but also introduced variability in results,
such as inconsistent hair color changes. Our research aims to enhance the
precision and reliability of prompt-to-prompt image editing frameworks by
exploring and optimizing hyperparameters. We present a comprehensive study of
the "word swap" method, develop an "attention re-weight method" for better
adaptability, and propose the "CL P2P" framework to address existing

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在图形用户界面系统中的实际应用受到视觉定位可靠性的限制，无法准确执行指针级操作如点击或拖动。

Method: 训练一个用于图像推理的模型，动态调用多个专门工具来迭代缩小屏幕相关区域的焦点。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro基准测试中，仅使用18.5K训练样本就达到52.8%准确率，超越了V2P-7B（50.6%，9.6M样本）和GTA-1-7B（50.1%，1.56M样本）。

Conclusion: GUI-Spotlight通过迭代聚焦方法显著提高了视觉定位准确性，为图形用户界面系统的实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have markedly expanded the
competence of graphical user-interface (GUI) systems, propelling them beyond
controlled simulations into complex, real-world environments across diverse
platforms. However, practical usefulness is still bounded by the reliability of
visual grounding, i.e., mapping textual references to exact on-screen elements.
This limitation prevents the system from accurately performing pointer-level
actions such as clicking or dragging. To address it, we introduce GUI-Spotlight
-- a model trained for image-grounded reasoning that dynamically invokes
multiple specialized tools to iteratively narrow its focus to the relevant
region of the screen, thereby substantially improving visual grounding
accuracy. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, GUI-Spotlight trained with only
18.5K training samples achieves 52.8\% accuracy, surpassing V2P-7B (50.6\% with
9.6M training samples) and GTA-1-7B (50.1\% with 1.56M training samples).

Abstract: Post-training quantization for reducing the storage of deep neural network
models has been demonstrated to be an effective way in various tasks. However,
low-bit quantization while maintaining model accuracy is a challenging problem.
In this paper, we present a range estimation method to improve the quantization
performance for post-training quantization. We model the range estimation into
an optimization problem of minimizing quantization errors by layer-wise local
minima. We prove this problem is locally convex and present an efficient search
algorithm to find the optimal solution. We propose the application of the above
search algorithm to the transformed weights space to do further improvement in
practice. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art performance generally on top-1 accuracy for image
classification tasks on the ResNet series models and Inception-v3 model. The
experimental results show that the proposed method has almost no loss of top-1
accuracy in 8-bit and 6-bit settings for image classifications, and the
accuracy of 4-bit quantization is also significantly improved. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D资产检索中的两个核心挑战：(i) 忽视空间、语义和风格约束的不一致检索；(ii) 缺乏专门针对3D资产检索的标准化范式，现有方法主要依赖通用3D形状表示模型。

Method: 提出灵活的检索机制，支持文本、图像和3D模态的任意组合查询，通过联合建模对象级特征（包括外观）和场景级布局结构来增强空间推理和风格一致性。引入即插即用的等变布局编码器ESSGNN来捕获空间关系和对象外观特征。

Conclusion: MetaFind通过三模态组合检索框架有效提升了3D资产检索的空间和风格一致性，支持迭代式场景构建，为元宇宙场景生成提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: We present MetaFind, a scene-aware tri-modal compositional retrieval
framework designed to enhance scene generation in the metaverse by retrieving
3D assets from large-scale repositories. MetaFind addresses two core
challenges: (i) inconsistent asset retrieval that overlooks spatial, semantic,
and stylistic constraints, and (ii) the absence of a standardized retrieval
paradigm specifically tailored for 3D asset retrieval, as existing approaches
mainly rely on general-purpose 3D shape representation models. Our key
innovation is a flexible retrieval mechanism that supports arbitrary
combinations of text, image, and 3D modalities as queries, enhancing spatial
reasoning and style consistency by jointly modeling object-level features
(including appearance) and scene-level layout structures. Methodologically,
MetaFind introduces a plug-and-play equivariant layout encoder ESSGNN that
captures spatial relationships and object appearance features, ensuring
retrieved 3D assets are contextually and stylistically coherent with the
existing scene, regardless of coordinate frame transformations. The framework
supports iterative scene construction by continuously adapting retrieval
results to current scene updates. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the
improved spatial and stylistic consistency of MetaFind in various retrieval
tasks compared to baseline methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的损失函数，将耀斑子类间的序数信息整合到二元交叉熵损失中，通过序数加权来提升模型在预测阈值附近的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的二元耀斑预测框架忽略了耀斑子类间的序数关系，导致模型在预测阈值附近容易产生误分类。研究表明，大多数误分类都发生在阈值附近，表明模型难以区分强度相似但位于二元阈值两侧的事件。

Method: 提出了一种改进的损失函数，将耀斑子类间的序数信息整合到常规的二元交叉熵损失中。该方法作为一种序数感知、数据驱动的正则化方法，在模型优化过程中对接近预测阈值的错误预测施加更重的惩罚。

Result: 通过将序数加权整合到损失函数中，旨在利用数据的序数特性来增强模型的学习过程，从而提高整体性能。

Conclusion: 提出的序数感知损失函数能够有效缓解二元分类框架在耀斑预测中的局限性，通过更精细地处理阈值附近的分类问题来提升模型性能。

Abstract: The prediction of solar flares is typically formulated as a binary
classification task, distinguishing events as either Flare (FL) or No-Flare
(NF) according to a specified threshold (for example, greater than or equal to
C-class, M-class, or X-class). However, this binary framework neglects the
inherent ordinal relationships among the sub-classes contained within each
category (FL and NF). Several studies on solar flare prediction have
empirically shown that the most frequent misclassifications occur near this
prediction threshold. This suggests that the models struggle to differentiate
events that are similar in intensity but fall on opposite sides of the binary
threshold. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a modified loss function
that integrates the ordinal information among the sub-classes of the binarized
flare labels into the conventional binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss. This
approach serves as an ordinality-aware, data-driven regularization method that
penalizes the incorrect predictions of flare events in close proximity to the
prediction threshold more heavily than those away from the boundary during
model optimization. By incorporating ordinal weighting into the loss function,
we aim to enhance the model's learning process by leveraging the ordinal
characteristics of the data, thereby improving its overall performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了QuantDemoire，一种专为去摩尔纹任务设计的后训练量化框架，通过异常值感知量化器和频率感知校准策略，在保持质量的同时大幅减少参数和计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的去摩尔纹深度学习方法需要大量计算资源，限制了在边缘设备上的部署。直接应用现有量化方法会导致严重的性能下降，主要原因是分布异常值和平滑区域表示弱化。

Method: 1. 异常值感知量化器：使用基于采样的范围估计减少激活异常值，并将少量极端权重保留为FP16格式；2. 频率感知校准策略：在微调过程中强调低中频分量，减轻低比特量化引起的带状伪影。

Result: 在W4A4配置下，QuantDemoire比现有量化方法性能提升超过4dB，同时实现了参数和计算量的大幅减少。

Conclusion: QuantDemoire为去摩尔纹模型提供了一种有效的量化解决方案，在保持图像质量的同时显著提升了计算效率，适合边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Demoir\'eing aims to remove moir\'e artifacts that often occur in images.
While recent deep learning-based methods have achieved promising results, they
typically require substantial computational resources, limiting their
deployment on edge devices. Model quantization offers a compelling solution.
However, directly applying existing quantization methods to demoir\'eing models
introduces severe performance degradation. The main reasons are distribution
outliers and weakened representations in smooth regions. To address these
issues, we propose QuantDemoire, a post-training quantization framework
tailored to demoir\'eing. It contains two key components. **First}, we
introduce an outlier-aware quantizer to reduce errors from outliers. It uses
sampling-based range estimation to reduce activation outliers, and keeps a few
extreme weights in FP16 with negligible cost. **Second**, we design a
frequency-aware calibration strategy. It emphasizes low- and mid-frequency
components during fine-tuning, which mitigates banding artifacts caused by
low-bit quantization. Extensive experiments validate that our QuantDemoire
achieves large reductions in parameters and computation while maintaining
quality. Meanwhile, it outperforms existing quantization methods by over **4
dB** on W4A4. Code is released at:

TL;DR: TV-LoRA是一种结合扩散生成先验和多正则化约束的低剂量稀疏视图CT重建方法，在ADMM框架下实现高效3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决极稀疏视图下CT重建的病态问题和纹理丢失问题，结合生成先验和物理约束提升重建质量。

Method: 结合扩散生成先验(NCSN++ SDE建模)、各向异性TV和核范数(LoRA)正则化，采用ADMM框架，使用2D切片策略并利用FFT加速和并行优化。

Result: 在AAPM-2016、CTHD和LIDC数据集上，TV-LoRA在SSIM、纹理恢复、边缘清晰度和伪影抑制方面均优于基准方法，展现了强鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: TV-LoRA结合扩散先验和正则化约束，实现了高保真、高效的3D CT重建，在低剂量稀疏采样场景中具有广泛的临床适用性。

Abstract: This work presents TV-LoRA, a novel method for low-dose sparse-view CT
reconstruction that combines a diffusion generative prior (NCSN++ with SDE
modeling) and multi-regularization constraints, including anisotropic TV and
nuclear norm (LoRA), within an ADMM framework. To address ill-posedness and
texture loss under extremely sparse views, TV-LoRA integrates generative and
physical constraints, and utilizes a 2D slice-based strategy with FFT
acceleration and tensor-parallel optimization for efficient inference.
Experiments on AAPM-2016, CTHD, and LIDC datasets with
$N_{\mathrm{view}}=8,4,2$ show that TV-LoRA consistently surpasses benchmarks
in SSIM, texture recovery, edge clarity, and artifact suppression,
demonstrating strong robustness and generalizability. Ablation studies confirm
the complementary effects of LoRA regularization and diffusion priors, while
the FFT-PCG module provides a speedup. Overall, Diffusion + TV-LoRA achieves
high-fidelity, efficient 3D CT reconstruction and broad clinical applicability
in low-dose, sparse-sampling scenarios.

Motivation: 拓扑映射领域缺乏标准化的评估指标、数据集和协议，现有系统在不同环境和标准下评估，无法进行公平比较。感知混淆这一关键挑战也未被充分量化。

Method: 形式化拓扑一致性作为拓扑图的基本属性，提出定位精度作为可解释的替代指标；提出数据集模糊度的量化方法；构建具有校准模糊度水平的多样化基准数据集；实现并发布深度学习基线系统。

Result: 实验和分析揭示了当前方法在感知混淆下的局限性，为拓扑映射研究提供了新的见解。

Conclusion: 所有数据集、基线系统和评估工具都已开源，旨在促进拓扑映射领域的一致性和可复现性研究。

Abstract: Topological mapping offers a compact and robust representation for
navigation, but progress in the field is hindered by the lack of standardized
evaluation metrics, datasets, and protocols. Existing systems are assessed
using different environments and criteria, preventing fair and reproducible
comparisons. Moreover, a key challenge - perceptual aliasing - remains
under-quantified, despite its strong influence on system performance. We
address these gaps by (1) formalizing topological consistency as the
fundamental property of topological maps and showing that localization accuracy
provides an efficient and interpretable surrogate metric, and (2) proposing the
first quantitative measure of dataset ambiguity to enable fair comparisons
across environments. To support this protocol, we curate a diverse benchmark
dataset with calibrated ambiguity levels, implement and release deep-learned
baseline systems, and evaluate them alongside classical methods. Our
experiments and analysis yield new insights into the limitations of current
approaches under perceptual aliasing. All datasets, baselines, and evaluation
tools are fully open-sourced to foster consistent and reproducible research in
topological mapping.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事件流估计方法存在两个关键问题：缺乏网格流专用的数据集和方法，以及未充分探索事件数据密度带来的挑战。

Method: 1) 创建HREM高分辨率事件网格流数据集；2) 提出轻量级EEMFlow网络，采用编码器-解码器架构；3) 扩展支持密集事件光流，引入置信度诱导细节完成模块；4) 提出自适应密度模块ADM来优化输入事件数据密度。

Conclusion: 本文成功解决了事件网格流估计的关键挑战，通过新数据集、高效网络和密度自适应方法，显著提升了事件相机运动估计的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the problem of event-based meshflow estimation, a
novel task that involves predicting a spatially smooth sparse motion field from
event cameras. To start, we review the state-of-the-art in event-based flow
estimation, highlighting two key areas for further research: i) the lack of
meshflow-specific event datasets and methods, and ii) the underexplored
challenge of event data density. First, we generate a large-scale
High-Resolution Event Meshflow (HREM) dataset, which showcases its superiority
by encompassing the merits of high resolution at 1280x720, handling dynamic
objects and complex motion patterns, and offering both optical flow and
meshflow labels. These aspects have not been fully explored in previous works.
Besides, we propose Efficient Event-based MeshFlow (EEMFlow) network, a
lightweight model featuring a specially crafted encoder-decoder architecture to
facilitate swift and accurate meshflow estimation. Furthermore, we upgrade
EEMFlow network to support dense event optical flow, in which a
Confidence-induced Detail Completion (CDC) module is proposed to preserve sharp
motion boundaries. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show the exceptional
performance and runtime efficiency (30x faster) of our EEMFlow model compared
to the recent state-of-the-art flow method. As an extension, we expand HREM
into HREM+, a multi-density event dataset contributing to a thorough study of
the robustness of existing methods across data with varying densities, and
propose an Adaptive Density Module (ADM) to adjust the density of input event
data to a more optimal range, enhancing the model's generalization ability. We
empirically demonstrate that ADM helps to significantly improve the performance
of EEMFlow and EEMFlow+ by 8% and 10%, respectively. Code and dataset are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的6D物体姿态估计方法，通过预训练编码器和联合学习策略加速训练收敛，并引入采样指导机制消除额外评估网络需求，在多个基准测试中达到最先进精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的6D姿态估计方法存在训练收敛慢、需要端到端学习编码器、以及需要额外网络来过滤低质量姿态候选的问题。

Method: 1) 预训练编码器并使用直接姿态回归头，联合学习回归头和去噪扩散头；2) 提出时间相关分数缩放的采样指导机制，平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在REAL275、HouseCat6D和ROPE等多个基准测试中达到最先进精度，即使使用单姿态推理也能实现高效训练和推理。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，通过联合学习策略和采样指导机制，显著提升了6D物体姿态估计的性能和效率。

Abstract: Latest diffusion models have shown promising results in category-level 6D
object pose estimation by modeling the conditional pose distribution with depth
image input. The existing methods, however, suffer from slow convergence during
training, learning its encoder with the diffusion denoising network in
end-to-end fashion, and require an additional network that evaluates sampled
pose hypotheses to filter out low-quality pose candidates. In this paper, we
propose a novel pipeline that tackles these limitations by two key components.
First, the proposed method pretrains the encoder with the direct pose
regression head, and jointly learns the networks via the regression head and
the denoising diffusion head, significantly accelerating training convergence
while achieving higher accuracy. Second, sampling guidance via time-dependent
score scaling is proposed s.t. the exploration-exploitation trade-off is
effectively taken, eliminating the need for the additional evaluation network.
The sampling guidance maintains multi-modal characteristics of symmetric
objects at early denoising steps while ensuring high-quality pose generation at
final steps. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks including REAL275,
HouseCat6D, and ROPE, demonstrate that the proposed method, simple yet
effective, achieves state-of-the-art accuracies even with single-pose
inference, while being more efficient in both training and inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型蒸馏过程中，多个教师模型产生的推理轨迹存在概念漂移问题，导致推理分布不可预测地演化，并将偏见传递给学生模型，最终影响其性能。

Method: 提出自主偏好优化(APO)方法，在教师模型的主动指导下，学生模型首先通过比较多个教师来学习和自我蒸馏偏好思维，然后对教师漂移推理进行批判性反思，通过概念对齐实现模型优化。

Result: 实验表明该方法在知识蒸馏中具有优越的一致性、鲁棒性和泛化性能，并贡献了包含170,982条蒸馏推理轨迹的大规模数据集CXR-MAX。

Conclusion: 通过连接概念漂移与知识蒸馏的理论框架，提出的APO方法能够有效解决多教师蒸馏中的概念漂移问题，产生鲁棒、一致且可泛化的模型。

Abstract: This paper identifies a critical yet underexplored challenge in distilling
from multimodal large language models (MLLMs): the reasoning trajectories
generated by multiple drifting teachers exhibit concept drift, whereby their
reasoning distributions evolve unpredictably and transmit biases to the student
model, ultimately compromising its performance. To tackle this issue, we
pioneer a theoretical connection between concept drift and knowledge
distillation, casting the non-stationary reasoning dynamics from multiple MLLM
teachers as next-token prediction of multi-stream reasoning trajectories.Guided
by concept drift, we introduce the "learn, compare, critique" paradigm,
culminating in autonomous preference optimization (APO). Under the active
guidance of the teachers, the student model first learns and self-distils
preferred thinking by comparing multiple teachers. It then engages in critical
reflection over the drifting inference from teachers, performing concept
alignment through APO, ultimately yielding a robust, consistent, and
generalizable model.Extensive experiments demonstrate our superior performance
of consistency, robustness and generalization within knowledge distillation.
Besides, we also contributed a large-scale dataset, CXR-MAX (Multi-teachers
Alignment X-rays), comprising 170,982 distilled reasoning trajectories derived
from publicly accessible MLLMs based on MIMIC-CXR. Our code and data are public

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统建筑安全检查方法效率低下，需要处理大量信息。现有的大语言模型应用存在响应不相关、模态输入受限和幻觉问题，且缺乏实时适应性。

Method: 开发了SiteShield框架，结合多模态LVLM和检索增强生成技术，整合视觉和音频输入来自动化安全检查报告生成。

Result: 使用真实数据测试，SiteShield在F1分数（0.82）、汉明损失（0.04）、精确率（0.76）和召回率（0.96）方面均优于无RAG的单模态LLM。

Conclusion: SiteShield为增强信息检索和安全报告生成效率提供了一条新途径。

Abstract: Conventional construction safety inspection methods are often inefficient as
they require navigating through large volume of information. Recent advances in
large vision-language models (LVLMs) provide opportunities to automate safety
inspections through enhanced visual and linguistic understanding. However,
existing applications face limitations including irrelevant or unspecific
responses, restricted modal inputs and hallucinations. Utilisation of Large
Language Models (LLMs) for this purpose is constrained by availability of
training data and frequently lack real-time adaptability. This study introduces
SiteShield, a multi-modal LVLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
framework for automating construction safety inspection reports by integrating
visual and audio inputs. Using real-world data, SiteShield outperformed
unimodal LLMs without RAG with an F1 score of 0.82, hamming loss of 0.04,
precision of 0.76, and recall of 0.96. The findings indicate that SiteShield
offers a novel pathway to enhance information retrieval and efficiency in
generating safety reports.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络容易学习训练数据中的虚假相关性，现有方法需要偏置先验知识或偏置冲突样本，这在现实场景中往往不切实际。

Method: 首先训练生成模型在偏置域间翻译图像并保留任务相关特征，然后基于图像对偏置的敏感性自适应精炼图像，通过对齐任务相关特征但偏置不同的样本来鼓励鲁棒表示。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上显著优于最先进方法，在损坏CIFAR-10数据集的最差组设置下比最接近的基线绝对提升约18%。

Conclusion: BLADE为无需显式监督开发更鲁棒的深度学习模型建立了新基准，展示了强大的偏置缓解潜力。

Abstract: Neural networks have revolutionized numerous fields, yet they remain
vulnerable to a critical flaw: the tendency to learn implicit biases, spurious
correlations between certain attributes and target labels in training data.
These biases are often more prevalent and easier to learn, causing models to
rely on superficial patterns rather than task-relevant features necessary for
generalization. Existing methods typically rely on strong assumptions, such as
prior knowledge of these biases or access to bias-conflicting samples, i.e.,
samples that contradict spurious correlations and counterbalance bias-aligned
samples, samples that conform to these spurious correlations. However, such
assumptions are often impractical in real-world settings. We propose BLADE
({B}ias-{L}inked {A}daptive {DE}biasing), a generative debiasing framework that
requires no prior knowledge of bias or bias-conflicting samples. BLADE first
trains a generative model to translate images across bias domains while
preserving task-relevant features. Then, it adaptively refines each image with
its synthetic counterpart based on the image's susceptibility to bias. To
encourage robust representations, BLADE aligns an image with its
bias-translated synthetic counterpart that shares task-relevant features but
differs in bias, while misaligning it with samples sharing the same bias. We
evaluate BLADE on multiple benchmark datasets and show that it significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, it exceeds the closest baseline
by an absolute margin of around 18% on the corrupted CIFAR-10 dataset under the
worst group setting, establishing a new benchmark in bias mitigation and
demonstrating its potential for developing more robust deep learning models
without explicit supervision.

<details>

Motivation: 深度神经网络缺乏可解释性，在安全关键应用中限制了可信度。现有概念瓶颈模型需要昂贵的概念标注且缺乏空间定位，无法识别支持每个概念的区域。

Method: 集成概念引导图像分割到注意力多实例学习框架，将分割区域视为实例，学习跨区域证据聚合，通过语义区域推理对齐高层概念。

Conclusion: SEG-MIL-CBM通过语义区域推理实现了无需概念标注的透明、空间定位的概念级解释，在多种设置下保持稳健性能。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in computer vision;
however, their black-box nature in decision-making limits interpretability and
trust, particularly in safety-critical applications. Interpretability is
crucial in domains where errors have severe consequences. Existing models not
only lack transparency but also risk exploiting unreliable or misleading
features, which undermines both robustness and the validity of their
explanations. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to improve transparency by
reasoning through human-interpretable concepts. Still, they require costly
concept annotations and lack spatial grounding, often failing to identify which
regions support each concept. We propose SEG-MIL-CBM, a novel framework that
integrates concept-guided image segmentation into an attention-based multiple
instance learning (MIL) framework, where each segmented region is treated as an
instance and the model learns to aggregate evidence across them. By reasoning
over semantically meaningful regions aligned with high-level concepts, our
model highlights task-relevant evidence, down-weights irrelevant cues, and
produces spatially grounded, concept-level explanations without requiring
annotations of concepts or groups. SEG-MIL-CBM achieves robust performance
across settings involving spurious correlations (unintended dependencies
between background and label), input corruptions (perturbations that degrade
visual quality), and large-scale benchmarks, while providing transparent,
concept-level explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器的迭代采样过程由于每个时间步都需要进行昂贵的变换器前向传递而成为主要瓶颈，现有缓存方法对所有特征维度采用统一策略，忽略了它们异质的动态行为。

Method: 将隐藏特征演化建模为跨维度的ODE混合，引入HyCa框架应用维度级缓存策略。

Result: 在多个领域和模型上实现近无损加速：FLUX加速5.55倍，HunyuanVideo加速5.56倍，Qwen-Image和Qwen-Image-Edit加速6.24倍，无需重新训练。

Conclusion: HyCa通过维度级缓存策略有效解决了扩散变换器采样瓶颈，实现了显著的加速效果。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers offer state-of-the-art fidelity in image and video
synthesis, but their iterative sampling process remains a major bottleneck due
to the high cost of transformer forward passes at each timestep. To mitigate
this, feature caching has emerged as a training-free acceleration technique
that reuses or forecasts hidden representations. However, existing methods
often apply a uniform caching strategy across all feature dimensions, ignoring
their heterogeneous dynamic behaviors. Therefore, we adopt a new perspective by
modeling hidden feature evolution as a mixture of ODEs across dimensions, and
introduce HyCa, a Hybrid ODE solver inspired caching framework that applies
dimension-wise caching strategies. HyCa achieves near-lossless acceleration
across diverse domains and models, including 5.55 times speedup on FLUX, 5.56
times speedup on HunyuanVideo, 6.24 times speedup on Qwen-Image and
Qwen-Image-Edit without retraining.

Abstract: While text-to-image (T2I) models can synthesize high-quality images, their
performance degrades significantly when prompted with novel or
out-of-distribution (OOD) entities due to inherent knowledge cutoffs. We
introduce World-To-Image, a novel framework that bridges this gap by empowering
T2I generation with agent-driven world knowledge. We design an agent that
dynamically searches the web to retrieve images for concepts unknown to the
base model. This information is then used to perform multimodal prompt
optimization, steering powerful generative backbones toward an accurate
synthesis. Critically, our evaluation goes beyond traditional metrics,
utilizing modern assessments like LLMGrader and ImageReward to measure true
semantic fidelity. Our experiments show that World-To-Image substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both semantic alignment and visual
aesthetics, achieving +8.1% improvement in accuracy-to-prompt on our curated
NICE benchmark. Our framework achieves these results with high efficiency in
less than three iterations, paving the way for T2I systems that can better
reflect the ever-changing real world. Our demo code is available

<details>

Motivation: 传统自回归模型使用平坦的无结构视觉词汇表，忽视了token嵌入空间的固有结构，导致预测任务复杂，限制了训练效率和生成质量。

Method: 提出MASC框架，使用几何感知距离度量和密度驱动的凝聚构建方法，从codebook固有结构中直接构建层次化语义树，将高维平坦预测任务转化为结构化层次预测。

Result: 训练速度提升高达57%，LlamaGen-XL的FID从2.87降至2.58，生成质量显著改善，使现有AR框架与最先进方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 结构化预测空间对于可扩展生成建模与架构创新同等重要，MASC证明了通过建模token嵌入空间的底层流形可以显著简化学习问题。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have shown great promise in image generation, yet
they face a fundamental inefficiency stemming from their core component: a
vast, unstructured vocabulary of visual tokens. This conventional approach
treats tokens as a flat vocabulary, disregarding the intrinsic structure of the
token embedding space where proximity often correlates with semantic
similarity. This oversight results in a highly complex prediction task, which
hinders training efficiency and limits final generation quality. To resolve
this, we propose Manifold-Aligned Semantic Clustering (MASC), a principled
framework that constructs a hierarchical semantic tree directly from the
codebook's intrinsic structure. MASC employs a novel geometry-aware distance
metric and a density-driven agglomerative construction to model the underlying
manifold of the token embeddings. By transforming the flat, high-dimensional
prediction task into a structured, hierarchical one, MASC introduces a
beneficial inductive bias that significantly simplifies the learning problem
for the AR model. MASC is designed as a plug-and-play module, and our extensive
experiments validate its effectiveness: it accelerates training by up to 57%
and significantly improves generation quality, reducing the FID of LlamaGen-XL
from 2.87 to 2.58. MASC elevates existing AR frameworks to be highly
competitive with state-of-the-art methods, establishing that structuring the
prediction space is as crucial as architectural innovation for scalable
generative modeling.

Motivation: AI生成图像的快速发展模糊了真实与合成内容的界限，现有视觉语言模型难以检测高质量合成图像中的细微伪影。

Method: 模仿人类视觉检查，首先扫描图像定位可疑区域，然后对这些放大区域进行聚焦分析，使用MagniFake数据集进行训练。

Result: 方法达到96.39%的准确率，具有稳健的泛化能力，并提供基于视觉证据的人类可理解解释。

Conclusion: ZoomIn框架在AI生成图像检测方面实现了高准确性和可解释性的平衡，为数字完整性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI-generated imagery has blurred the boundary between
real and synthetic content, raising critical concerns for digital integrity.
Vision-language models (VLMs) offer interpretability through explanations but
often fail to detect subtle artifacts in high-quality synthetic images. We
propose ZoomIn, a two-stage forensic framework that improves both accuracy and
interpretability. Mimicking human visual inspection, ZoomIn first scans an
image to locate suspicious regions and then performs a focused analysis on
these zoomed-in areas to deliver a grounded verdict. To support training, we
introduce MagniFake, a dataset of 20,000 real and high-quality synthetic images
annotated with bounding boxes and forensic explanations, generated through an
automated VLM-based pipeline. Our method achieves 96.39% accuracy with robust
generalization, while providing human-understandable explanations grounded in
visual evidence.

TL;DR: 提出一种简单、端到端可训练的图像配准算法，仅需少量Python代码即可实现，在训练数据和训练时间有限的情况下仍能获得准确结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像配准问题，即找到使两幅图像对应点位置一致的变换。传统方法复杂，需要大量训练数据和计算资源。

Method: 采用端到端可训练的简单算法，仅需少量Python代码实现。示例应用使用74张图像在19x15输入窗口上进行训练。

Result: 算法在训练数据和训练时间有限的情况下仍能获得准确结果，在立体视觉等应用中表现良好。

Conclusion: 该算法简洁高效，代码量少，适合在训练数据、训练时间或代码复杂度受限的相关场景中作为良好起点。

Abstract: The problem of image registration is finding a transformation that aligns two
images, such that the corresponding points are in the same location. This paper
introduces a simple, end-to-end trainable algorithm that is implementable in a
few lines of Python code. The approach is shown to work with very little
training data and training time, while achieving accurate results in some
settings. An example application to stereo vision was trained from 74 images on
a 19x15 input window. With just a dozen lines of Python code this algorithm
excels in brevity and may serve as a good start in related scenarios with
limitations to training data, training time or code complexity.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ArConv的新型卷积层，通过重新设计和优化卷积层来创建轻量级CNN模型，该模型仅含130万参数，在RfMiD数据集上表现优于MobileNetV2，准确率达到0.9328。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高深度神经网络的可访问性，特别是在移动设备上应用，用于眼科疾病的早期诊断。现有方法计算复杂度高，限制了在资源受限环境中的部署。

Method: 在最基础的卷积层层面进行重新设计和优化，开发了名为ArConv的新型卷积层，构建了一个通用的轻量级模型。

Result: 最终模型仅包含130万参数，在相同条件下训练和评估于RfMiD数据集时，准确率达到0.9328，优于拥有220万参数的MobileNetV2模型（准确率0.9266）。

Conclusion: 通过优化卷积层设计，成功创建了适用于移动设备的轻量级CNN模型，在保持高精度的同时显著降低了计算复杂度，提高了神经网络在眼科疾病诊断中的可访问性。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks are continually evolving, with some efforts
aimed at improving accuracy, others at increasing speed, and some at enhancing
accessibility. Improving accessibility broadens the application of neural
networks across a wider range of tasks, including the detection of eye
diseases. Early diagnosis of eye diseases and consulting an ophthalmologist can
prevent many vision disorders. Given the importance of this issue, various
datasets have been collected from the cornea to facilitate the process of
making neural network models. However, most of the methods introduced in the
past are computationally complex. In this study, we tried to increase the
accessibility of deep neural network models. We did this at the most
fundamental level, specifically by redesigning and optimizing the convolutional
layers. By doing so, we created a new general model that incorporates our novel
convolutional layer named ArConv layers. Thanks to the efficient performance of
this new layer, the model has suitable complexity for use in mobile phones and
can perform the task of diagnosing the presence of disease with high accuracy.
The final model we present contains only 1.3 million parameters. In comparison
to the MobileNetV2 model, which has 2.2 million parameters, our model
demonstrated better accuracy when trained and evaluated on the RfMiD dataset
under identical conditions, achieving an accuracy of 0.9328 versus 0.9266 on
the RfMiD test set.

TL;DR: Kaleido是一个用于照片级真实感神经渲染的生成模型家族，将3D视为视频的特殊子域，通过序列到序列的图像合成实现生成式视图合成，无需显式3D表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统神经渲染方法对显式3D表示和稀缺相机标注数据的依赖，通过统一3D和视频建模框架，利用大规模视频数据进行预训练。

Method: 采用序列到序列的生成式神经渲染，引入掩码自回归框架和仅解码器的整流流变换器，能够基于任意数量的参考视图生成任意数量的6自由度目标视图。

Result: 在多个视图合成基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，零样本性能在少视图设置中显著优于其他生成方法，在多视图设置中首次达到逐场景优化方法的质量。

Conclusion: Kaleido通过将3D视为视频子域的统一框架，实现了高质量的生成式神经渲染，减少了对稀缺3D数据的依赖，并展示了缩放序列到序列生成模型的潜力。

Abstract: We present Kaleido, a family of generative models designed for
photorealistic, unified object- and scene-level neural rendering. Kaleido
operates on the principle that 3D can be regarded as a specialised sub-domain
of video, expressed purely as a sequence-to-sequence image synthesis task.
Through a systemic study of scaling sequence-to-sequence generative neural
rendering, we introduce key architectural innovations that enable our model to:
i) perform generative view synthesis without explicit 3D representations; ii)
generate any number of 6-DoF target views conditioned on any number of
reference views via a masked autoregressive framework; and iii) seamlessly
unify 3D and video modelling within a single decoder-only rectified flow
transformer. Within this unified framework, Kaleido leverages large-scale video
data for pre-training, which significantly improves spatial consistency and
reduces reliance on scarce, camera-labelled 3D datasets -- all without any
architectural modifications. Kaleido sets a new state-of-the-art on a range of
view synthesis benchmarks. Its zero-shot performance substantially outperforms
other generative methods in few-view settings, and, for the first time, matches
the quality of per-scene optimisation methods in many-view settings.

TL;DR: 提出了CoSSeg-TTA框架，基于nnU-Netv2构建，用于Gd-EOB-DTPA增强肝胆期MRI的肝脏分割，通过半监督学习、域适应和测试时适应策略解决数据标注有限和跨域泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比增强MRI肝脏分割面临标注数据有限、增强协议异质、跨扫描仪和机构的域偏移等挑战，现有图像翻译方法存在结构扭曲、训练不稳定等问题，不适用于单模态场景。

Method: 基于nnU-Netv2，集成半监督均值教师方案利用未标注数据；包含随机化直方图风格外观转换和可训练对比感知网络的域适应模块；采用持续测试时适应策略提升推理鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明该框架在Dice分数和Hausdorff距离上持续优于nnU-Netv2基线，在低标注条件下对未见域具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: CoSSeg-TTA框架有效解决了肝脏分割中的域泛化问题，在有限标注数据下实现了优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate liver segmentation from contrast-enhanced MRI is essential for
diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. However, it remains
challenging due to limited annotated data, heterogeneous enhancement protocols,
and significant domain shifts across scanners and institutions. Traditional
image-to-image translation frameworks have made great progress in domain
generalization, but their application is not straightforward. For example,
Pix2Pix requires image registration, and cycle-GAN cannot be integrated
seamlessly into segmentation pipelines. Meanwhile, these methods are originally
used to deal with cross-modality scenarios, and often introduce structural
distortions and suffer from unstable training, which may pose drawbacks in our
single-modality scenario. To address these challenges, we propose CoSSeg-TTA, a
compact segmentation framework for the GED4 (Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced hepatobiliary
phase MRI) modality built upon nnU-Netv2 and enhanced with a semi-supervised
mean teacher scheme to exploit large amounts of unlabeled volumes. A domain
adaptation module, incorporating a randomized histogram-based style appearance
transfer function and a trainable contrast-aware network, enriches domain
diversity and mitigates cross-center variability. Furthermore, a continual
test-time adaptation strategy is employed to improve robustness during
inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms the nnU-Netv2 baseline, achieving superior Dice score and Hausdorff
Distance while exhibiting strong generalization to unseen domains under
low-annotation conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于概念解释的补丁无关防御方法，通过抑制最具影响力的概念激活向量来中和补丁攻击效果，无需显式检测补丁位置或大小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗补丁防御方法通常需要预知补丁大小或位置，限制了实际应用。需要开发不依赖补丁先验知识的通用防御方案。

Method: 利用基于概念的解释方法，识别并抑制最具影响力的概念激活向量，从而在不显式检测补丁的情况下中和其攻击效果。

Result: 在Imagenette数据集和ResNet-50模型上的评估显示，该方法在鲁棒性和清洁准确率方面均优于最先进的PatchCleanser方法，且在不同补丁大小和位置下保持强性能。

Conclusion: 将可解释性与鲁棒性相结合的概念驱动防御策略，为保护机器学习模型免受对抗补丁攻击提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks pose a practical threat to deep learning models by
forcing targeted misclassifications through localized perturbations, often
realized in the physical world. Existing defenses typically assume prior
knowledge of patch size or location, limiting their applicability. In this
work, we propose a patch-agnostic defense that leverages concept-based
explanations to identify and suppress the most influential concept activation
vectors, thereby neutralizing patch effects without explicit detection.
Evaluated on Imagenette with a ResNet-50, our method achieves higher robust and
clean accuracy than the state-of-the-art PatchCleanser, while maintaining
strong performance across varying patch sizes and locations. Our results
highlight the promise of combining interpretability with robustness and suggest
concept-driven defenses as a scalable strategy for securing machine learning
models against adversarial patch attacks.

TL;DR: 提出了Adapt-STformer方法，通过循环可变形Transformer编码器实现灵活高效的序列视觉位置识别，在保持性能的同时显著提升效率和灵活性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的序列视觉位置识别方法过于注重性能而牺牲了灵活性、推理速度和内存效率，无法满足实时应用需求

Method: 使用循环可变形Transformer编码器，通过迭代循环机制融合多帧序列信息，支持可变序列长度

Result: 在Nordland、Oxford和NuScenes数据集上，召回率提升高达17%，序列提取时间减少36%，内存使用降低35%

Conclusion: Adapt-STformer成功解决了现有方法在灵活性和效率方面的不足，为实时序列视觉位置识别提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Sequential Visual Place Recognition (Seq-VPR) leverages transformers to
capture spatio-temporal features effectively; however, existing approaches
prioritize performance at the expense of flexibility and efficiency. In
practice, a transformer-based Seq-VPR model should be flexible to the number of
frames per sequence (seq-length), deliver fast inference, and have low memory
usage to meet real-time constraints. To our knowledge, no existing
transformer-based Seq-VPR method achieves both flexibility and efficiency. To
address this gap, we propose Adapt-STformer, a Seq-VPR method built around our
novel Recurrent Deformable Transformer Encoder (Recurrent-DTE), which uses an
iterative recurrent mechanism to fuse information from multiple sequential
frames. This design naturally supports variable seq-lengths, fast inference,
and low memory usage. Experiments on the Nordland, Oxford, and NuScenes
datasets show that Adapt-STformer boosts recall by up to 17% while reducing
sequence extraction time by 36% and lowering memory usage by 35% compared to
the second-best baseline.

<details>

Motivation: 现有大型生成模型在图像编辑和上下文图像生成方面取得进展，但在确保物理一致性方面存在关键差距，这对于世界模拟相关任务尤为重要。

Method: 将输入和编辑图像视为视频的首尾帧，利用预训练视频生成模型；引入时间推理阶段，在推理时联合去噪目标帧和推理标记来想象合理的编辑轨迹。

Result: 在PBench-Edit基准测试中，ChronoEdit在视觉保真度和物理合理性方面超越了最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: ChronoEdit通过将图像编辑重新定义为视频生成问题，有效解决了物理一致性问题，为世界模拟相关任务提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large generative models have significantly advanced image
editing and in-context image generation, yet a critical gap remains in ensuring
physical consistency, where edited objects must remain coherent. This
capability is especially vital for world simulation related tasks. In this
paper, we present ChronoEdit, a framework that reframes image editing as a
video generation problem. First, ChronoEdit treats the input and edited images
as the first and last frames of a video, allowing it to leverage large
pretrained video generative models that capture not only object appearance but
also the implicit physics of motion and interaction through learned temporal
consistency. Second, ChronoEdit introduces a temporal reasoning stage that
explicitly performs editing at inference time. Under this setting, the target
frame is jointly denoised with reasoning tokens to imagine a plausible editing
trajectory that constrains the solution space to physically viable
transformations. The reasoning tokens are then dropped after a few steps to
avoid the high computational cost of rendering a full video. To validate
ChronoEdit, we introduce PBench-Edit, a new benchmark of image-prompt pairs for
contexts that require physical consistency, and demonstrate that ChronoEdit
surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both visual fidelity and physical
plausibility. Code and models for both the 14B and 2B variants of ChronoEdit
will be released on the project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帕金森病的客观步态评估受到缺乏大型、多样化且临床标注的运动数据集的限制。

Method: 将所有记录（RGB视频或运动捕捉）通过统一预处理流程转换为匿名SMPL网格，支持监督临床评分预测和无监督运动前置任务。

Result: 在CARE-PD上预训练显著降低了MPJPE（从60.8mm降至7.5mm），并将PD严重程度macro-F1提高了17个百分点。

Conclusion: CARE-PD证明了临床策划的多样化训练数据的价值，运动编码器始终优于手工特征，数据集和基准代码已发布供非商业研究使用。

Abstract: Objective gait assessment in Parkinson's Disease (PD) is limited by the
absence of large, diverse, and clinically annotated motion datasets. We
introduce CARE-PD, the largest publicly available archive of 3D mesh gait data
for PD, and the first multi-site collection spanning 9 cohorts from 8 clinical
centers. All recordings (RGB video or motion capture) are converted into
anonymized SMPL meshes via a harmonized preprocessing pipeline. CARE-PD
supports two key benchmarks: supervised clinical score prediction (estimating
Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, UPDRS, gait scores) and unsupervised
motion pretext tasks (2D-to-3D keypoint lifting and full-body 3D
reconstruction). Clinical prediction is evaluated under four generalization
protocols: within-dataset, cross-dataset, leave-one-dataset-out, and
multi-dataset in-domain adaptation. To assess clinical relevance, we compare
state-of-the-art motion encoders with a traditional gait-feature baseline,
finding that encoders consistently outperform handcrafted features. Pretraining
on CARE-PD reduces MPJPE (from 60.8mm to 7.5mm) and boosts PD severity macro-F1
by 17 percentage points, underscoring the value of clinically curated, diverse
training data. CARE-PD and all benchmark code are released for non-commercial

TL;DR: GenAR是一个多尺度自回归框架，通过从粗到细的方式预测空间转录组学数据，将基因聚类为层次组以捕捉基因间依赖关系，直接预测原始计数，并在解码时融合组织学和空间嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组学(ST)成本高昂，而H&E染色图像广泛可用。现有计算方法独立预测每个基因，忽略了共表达结构，并将任务视为连续回归，而表达实际上是离散计数，导致生物学上不合理的输出。

Method: GenAR采用多尺度自回归框架，将基因聚类为层次组以暴露跨基因依赖关系，将表达建模为无码本的离散标记生成来直接预测原始计数，并在解码时条件化融合的组织学和空间嵌入。

Result: 在四个不同组织类型的空间转录组学数据集上的广泛实验结果表明，GenAR实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: GenAR为精准医学和成本效益高的分子分析提供了潜在影响，其离散公式避免了log诱导的偏差，粗到细的分解与原则性的条件分解相一致。

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) offers spatially resolved gene expression but
remains costly. Predicting expression directly from widely available
Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images presents a cost-effective
alternative. However, most computational approaches (i) predict each gene
independently, overlooking co-expression structure, and (ii) cast the task as
continuous regression despite expression being discrete counts. This mismatch
can yield biologically implausible outputs and complicate downstream analyses.
We introduce GenAR, a multi-scale autoregressive framework that refines
predictions from coarse to fine. GenAR clusters genes into hierarchical groups
to expose cross-gene dependencies, models expression as codebook-free discrete
token generation to directly predict raw counts, and conditions decoding on
fused histological and spatial embeddings. From an information-theoretic
perspective, the discrete formulation avoids log-induced biases and the
coarse-to-fine factorization aligns with a principled conditional
decomposition. Extensive experimental results on four Spatial Transcriptomics
datasets across different tissue types demonstrate that GenAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance, offering potential implications for precision
medicine and cost-effective molecular profiling. Code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 本文提出RAP方法，通过轻量级3D栅格化替代昂贵的渲染技术，结合特征空间对齐，为端到端驾驶规划提供可扩展的数据增强方案，在多个基准测试中达到最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模仿学习方法在闭环部署时缺乏恢复数据，小错误会迅速累积导致失败。虽然神经渲染或游戏引擎能生成逼真的数字孪生，但成本高昂且速度慢，主要用于评估而非训练。作者认为驾驶规划不需要照片级真实感，而需要语义保真度和可扩展性。

Method: 提出3D栅格化技术，用轻量级栅格化标注基元替代昂贵渲染，支持反事实恢复机动和跨智能体视图合成。引入Raster-to-Real特征空间对齐来弥合仿真与现实的差距，形成RAP数据增强管道。

Result: RAP在四个主要基准测试中排名第一：NAVSIM v1/v2、Waymo开放数据集视觉端到端驾驶和Bench2Drive，实现了最先进的闭环鲁棒性和长尾泛化能力。

Conclusion: 轻量级栅格化结合特征对齐足以扩展端到端训练，为照片级渲染提供了实用的替代方案。

Abstract: Imitation learning for end-to-end driving trains policies only on expert
demonstrations. Once deployed in a closed loop, such policies lack recovery
data: small mistakes cannot be corrected and quickly compound into failures. A
promising direction is to generate alternative viewpoints and trajectories
beyond the logged path. Prior work explores photorealistic digital twins via
neural rendering or game engines, but these methods are prohibitively slow and
costly, and thus mainly used for evaluation. In this work, we argue that
photorealism is unnecessary for training end-to-end planners. What matters is
semantic fidelity and scalability: driving depends on geometry and dynamics,
not textures or lighting. Motivated by this, we propose 3D Rasterization, which
replaces costly rendering with lightweight rasterization of annotated
primitives, enabling augmentations such as counterfactual recovery maneuvers
and cross-agent view synthesis. To transfer these synthetic views effectively
to real-world deployment, we introduce a Raster-to-Real feature-space alignment
that bridges the sim-to-real gap. Together, these components form Rasterization
Augmented Planning (RAP), a scalable data augmentation pipeline for planning.
RAP achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop robustness and long-tail
generalization, ranking first on four major benchmarks: NAVSIM v1/v2, Waymo
Open Dataset Vision-based E2E Driving, and Bench2Drive. Our results show that
lightweight rasterization with feature alignment suffices to scale E2E
training, offering a practical alternative to photorealistic rendering. Project

Result: 在ETH/UCY和Stanford Drone数据集上实现了最先进的瞬时轨迹预测性能

Conclusion: Diffusion^2框架有效解决了观测数据不足时的行人轨迹预测问题，为自动驾驶和机器人交互提供了更安全可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and
efficiency in autonomous driving and human-robot interaction scenarios. Earlier
studies primarily utilized sufficient observational data to predict future
trajectories. However, in real-world scenarios, such as pedestrians suddenly
emerging from blind spots, sufficient observational data is often unavailable
(i.e. momentary trajectory), making accurate prediction challenging and
increasing the risk of traffic accidents. Therefore, advancing research on
pedestrian trajectory prediction under extreme scenarios is critical for
enhancing traffic safety. In this work, we propose a novel framework termed
Diffusion^2, tailored for momentary trajectory prediction. Diffusion^2 consists
of two sequentially connected diffusion models: one for backward prediction,
which generates unobserved historical trajectories, and the other for forward
prediction, which forecasts future trajectories. Given that the generated
unobserved historical trajectories may introduce additional noise, we propose a
dual-head parameterization mechanism to estimate their aleatoric uncertainty
and design a temporally adaptive noise module that dynamically modulates the
noise scale in the forward diffusion process. Empirically, Diffusion^2 sets a
new state-of-the-art in momentary trajectory prediction on ETH/UCY and Stanford
Drone datasets.

Abstract: World models that support controllable

  for robotics, enabling scalable training data, repro ducible evaluation, and

  recent text-to-video models generate realistic dynam ics, they are
constrained to 2D views and offer limited

generates 4D scenes with
  multi-view consistency and object-level controls. From
  natural language instructions, MorphoSim produces
  dynamic environments where objects can be directed,
  recolored, or removed, and scenes can be observed
  from arbitrary viewpoints. The framework integrates

to be applied interactively
  without full re-generation. Experiments show that Mor phoSim maintains high
scene fidelity while enabling
  controllability and editability. The code is available

TL;DR: 该论文提出了VLMCountBench基准测试，发现当前视觉语言模型在单一形状计数时表现可靠，但在组合形状计数时存在显著失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型在多种任务上表现出色，但作者质疑它们是否能正确计数物体，特别是在组合场景中。

Method: 创建了VLMCountBench基准，使用基本几何形状及其组合，在严格控制变量的简约设置下研究颜色、大小和提示优化等因素的影响。

Result: 实验结果显示，VLMs在单一形状类型计数时可靠，但在多种形状类型组合时出现显著失败。

Conclusion: 这揭示了当前VLMs的基本经验局限性，为未来研究指明了重要方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become a central focus of today's AI
community, owing to their impressive abilities gained from training on
large-scale vision-language data from the Web. These models have demonstrated
strong performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, video
understanding, complex visual reasoning, and embodied AI. Despite these
noteworthy successes, a fundamental question remains: Can VLMs count objects
correctly? In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective benchmark,
VLMCountBench, designed under a minimalist setting with only basic geometric
shapes (e.g., triangles, circles) and their compositions, focusing exclusively
on counting tasks without interference from other factors. We adopt strict
independent variable control and systematically study the effects of simple
properties such as color, size, and prompt refinement in a controlled ablation.
Our empirical results reveal that while VLMs can count reliably when only one
shape type is present, they exhibit substantial failures when multiple shape
types are combined (i.e., compositional counting). This highlights a
fundamental empirical limitation of current VLMs and motivates important
directions for future research.

*Venkata Bharath Reddy Reddem,Akshay P Sarashetti,Ranjith Merugu,Amit Satish Unde*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CodeFormer++是一个用于盲人脸恢复的新框架，通过分解任务为身份保留恢复、高质量生成和动态融合，解决了视觉质量与身份保真度之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视觉质量和身份保真度之间存在权衡，导致要么身份失真，要么退化去除不理想。

Method: 提出三个关键贡献：基于学习的可变形人脸配准模块、纹理引导恢复网络以及结合深度度量学习的身份保留与生成特征融合。

Result: 在真实世界和合成数据集上的广泛实验表明，CodeFormer++在视觉保真度和身份一致性方面均达到优越性能。

Conclusion: CodeFormer++框架成功最大化生成先验的效用，在保持身份的同时实现高质量人脸恢复。

Abstract: Blind face restoration (BFR) has attracted increasing attention with the rise
of generative methods. Most existing approaches integrate generative priors
into the restoration pro- cess, aiming to jointly address facial detail
generation and identity preservation. However, these methods often suffer from
a trade-off between visual quality and identity fidelity, leading to either
identity distortion or suboptimal degradation removal. In this paper, we
present CodeFormer++, a novel framework that maximizes the utility of
generative priors for high-quality face restoration while preserving identity.
We decompose BFR into three sub-tasks: (i) identity- preserving face
restoration, (ii) high-quality face generation, and (iii) dynamic fusion of
identity features with realistic texture details. Our method makes three key
contributions: (1) a learning-based deformable face registration module that
semantically aligns generated and restored faces; (2) a texture guided
restoration network to dynamically extract and transfer the texture of
generated face to boost the quality of identity-preserving restored face; and
(3) the integration of deep metric learning for BFR with the generation of
informative positive and hard negative samples to better fuse identity-
preserving and generative features. Extensive experiments on real-world and
synthetic datasets demonstrate that, the pro- posed CodeFormer++ achieves
superior performance in terms of both visual fidelity and identity consistency.

*Yuanhao Zou,Shengji Jin,Andong Deng,Youpeng Zhao,Jun Wang,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出A.I.R.方法，一种无需训练的自适应迭代推理帧选择方法，用于视频问答中的高效帧选择，平衡计算成本与准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有帧选择方法面临关键权衡：轻量级相似性模型无法捕捉复杂查询的细微差别，而使用VLM进行深度分析的方法计算成本过高。

Method: 利用强大的VLM对复杂查询进行深度语义分析，在成本效益高的迭代循环中每次只处理一小批最有潜力的帧。

Result: 在各种VideoQA基准测试中表现优于现有帧选择方法，显著提升基础VLM性能，并大幅提高计算效率。

Conclusion: A.I.R.方法有效解决了帧选择中的准确性与计算效率之间的权衡问题，为视频问答提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Effectively applying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to Video Question
Answering (VideoQA) hinges on selecting a concise yet comprehensive set of
frames, as processing entire videos is computationally infeasible. However,
current frame selection methods face a critical trade-off: approaches relying
on lightweight similarity models, such as CLIP, often fail to capture the
nuances of complex queries, resulting in inaccurate similarity scores that
cannot reflect the authentic query-frame relevance, which further undermines
frame selection. Meanwhile, methods that leverage a VLM for deeper analysis
achieve higher accuracy but incur prohibitive computational costs. To address
these limitations, we propose A.I.R., a training-free approach for Adaptive,
Iterative, and Reasoning-based frame selection. We leverage a powerful VLM to
perform deep, semantic analysis on complex queries, and this analysis is
deployed within a cost-effective iterative loop that processes only a small
batch of the most high-potential frames at a time. Extensive experiments on
various VideoQA benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
frame selection methods, significantly boosts the performance of the foundation
VLM, and achieves substantial gains in computational efficiency over other
VLM-based techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了reAR训练策略，通过token-wise正则化目标解决视觉自回归生成中的生成器-分词器不一致问题，显著提升了图像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉自回归生成性能落后于扩散模型，研究发现核心瓶颈在于生成器与分词器的不一致性——AR生成的token可能无法被分词器良好解码。

Method: 引入token-wise正则化目标：在预测下一个token时，因果变换器同时学习恢复当前token的视觉嵌入，并在噪声上下文中预测目标token的嵌入。无需改变分词器、生成顺序、推理流程或外部模型。

Result: 在ImageNet上，将gFID从3.02降至1.86，IS提升至316.9。应用于先进分词器后，仅用177M参数就达到gFID 1.42，与更大的扩散模型（675M）性能相当。

Conclusion: reAR通过简单的训练策略有效解决了生成器-分词器不一致问题，显著提升了视觉自回归生成的性能，使其能够与最先进的扩散模型竞争。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive (AR) generation offers a promising path toward unifying
vision and language models, yet its performance remains suboptimal against
diffusion models. Prior work often attributes this gap to tokenizer limitations
and rasterization ordering. In this work, we identify a core bottleneck from
the perspective of generator-tokenizer inconsistency, i.e., the AR-generated
tokens may not be well-decoded by the tokenizer. To address this, we propose
reAR, a simple training strategy introducing a token-wise regularization
objective: when predicting the next token, the causal transformer is also
trained to recover the visual embedding of the current token and predict the
embedding of the target token under a noisy context. It requires no changes to
the tokenizer, generation order, inference pipeline, or external models.
Despite its simplicity, reAR substantially improves performance. On ImageNet,
it reduces gFID from 3.02 to 1.86 and improves IS to 316.9 using a standard
rasterization-based tokenizer. When applied to advanced tokenizers, it achieves
a gFID of 1.42 with only 177M parameters, matching the performance with larger
state-of-the-art diffusion models (675M).

TL;DR: SPEGNet提出了一种统一的伪装目标检测方法，通过通道校准和空间增强整合多尺度特征，避免了传统方法中复杂组件累积带来的计算负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前伪装目标检测方法依赖累积复杂组件（如边界模块、注意力机制、多尺度处理器），导致计算负担增加但性能提升不成比例，且因处理分辨率降低而丢失精细细节。

Method: SPEGNet采用统一设计，通过通道校准和空间增强整合多尺度特征，边界直接从上下文丰富的表示中产生，保持语义-空间对齐，并采用渐进细化实现尺度自适应边缘调制。

Result: 在CAMO数据集上达到0.887 Sα，COD10K上0.890，NC4K上0.895，具有实时推理速度，在从微小复杂物体到大型模式相似物体的各种尺度上都表现出色。

Conclusion: SPEGNet在边界精度和区域一致性之间取得了平衡，能够有效处理遮挡和模糊边界，提供了一种高效且性能优越的伪装目标检测解决方案。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection segments objects with intrinsic similarity and
edge disruption. Current detection methods rely on accumulated complex
components. Each approach adds components such as boundary modules, attention
mechanisms, and multi-scale processors independently. This accumulation creates
a computational burden without proportional gains. To manage this complexity,
they process at reduced resolutions, eliminating fine details essential for
camouflage. We present SPEGNet, addressing fragmentation through a unified
design. The architecture integrates multi-scale features via channel
calibration and spatial enhancement. Boundaries emerge directly from
context-rich representations, maintaining semantic-spatial alignment.
Progressive refinement implements scale-adaptive edge modulation with peak
influence at intermediate resolutions. This design strikes a balance between
boundary precision and regional consistency. SPEGNet achieves 0.887 $S_\alpha$
on CAMO, 0.890 on COD10K, and 0.895 on NC4K, with real-time inference speed.
Our approach excels across scales, from tiny, intricate objects to large,
pattern-similar ones, while handling occlusion and ambiguous boundaries. Code,

Method: 提出MedCLM自动化管道，将检测数据集转换为大规模医疗VQA数据，包含思维链推理；采用集成CoT课程策略，分为简单（显式病变框）、中等（隐式定位）和困难（弱监督推理）三个阶段。

Result: MedCLM在多个医疗VQA基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，为开发临床对齐的医疗视觉语言模型提供了可扩展框架。

Conclusion: MedCLM通过创新的数据生成和课程学习策略，成功实现了医疗影像中临床诊断推理与AI的有效融合，为医疗视觉语言模型的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Bridging clinical diagnostic reasoning with AI remains a central challenge in
medical imaging. We introduce MedCLM, an automated pipeline that converts
detection datasets into large-scale medical visual question answering (VQA)
data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning by linking lesion boxes to organ
segmentation and structured rationales. These contextual signals enable medical
vision-language models to generate question-answer pairs with step-by-step
reasoning. To utilize this data effectively, we propose an Integrated
CoT-Curriculum Strategy composed of an Easy stage with explicit lesion boxes
for visual grounding, a Medium stage that encourages implicit localization, and
a Hard stage for weakly supervised reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate
that MedCLM attains state-of-the-art performance on several medical VQA
benchmarks, providing a scalable framework for developing clinically aligned
medical vision-language models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved significant progress in
multimodal understanding tasks, demonstrating strong capabilities particularly
in general tasks such as image captioning and visual reasoning. However, when
dealing with specialized cultural heritage domains like 3D vase artifacts,
existing models face severe data scarcity issues and insufficient domain
knowledge limitations. Due to the lack of targeted training data, current VLMs
struggle to effectively handle such culturally significant specialized tasks.
To address these challenges, we propose the VaseVQA-3D dataset, which serves as
the first 3D visual question answering dataset for ancient Greek pottery
analysis, collecting 664 ancient Greek vase 3D models with corresponding
question-answer data and establishing a complete data construction pipeline. We
further develop the VaseVLM model, enhancing model performance in vase artifact
analysis through domain-adaptive training. Experimental results validate the
effectiveness of our approach, where we improve by 12.8% on R@1 metrics and by
6.6% on lexical similarity compared with previous state-of-the-art on the
VaseVQA-3D dataset, significantly improving the recognition and understanding
of 3D vase artifacts, providing new technical pathways for digital heritage

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用图像生成和编辑模型在电商场景中经常遇到一致性限制，无法保持产品外观和布局的完整性，因此需要专门针对电商领域开发编辑模型。

Method: 采用分层模型框架（基础模型、模式转换模块、一致性增强模块），通过两阶段训练策略：第一阶段进行编辑模式转换，第二阶段进行一致性增强，每个阶段使用不同的数据集训练不同模块。

Result: 在自建的电商基准测试中，TBStar-Edit在客观指标（VIE Score）和主观用户偏好方面都优于现有的通用领域编辑模型。

Conclusion: TBStar-Edit通过专门的数据工程、模型架构设计和训练策略，成功实现了电商领域的高保真图像编辑，同时保持了产品外观和布局的一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation and editing technologies have enabled
state-of-the-art models to achieve impressive results in general domains.
However, when applied to e-commerce scenarios, these general models often
encounter consistency limitations. To address this challenge, we introduce
TBStar-Edit, an new image editing model tailored for the e-commerce domain.
Through rigorous data engineering, model architecture design and training
strategy, TBStar-Edit achieves precise and high-fidelity image editing while
maintaining the integrity of product appearance and layout. Specifically, for
data engineering, we establish a comprehensive data construction pipeline,
encompassing data collection, construction, filtering, and augmentation, to
acquire high-quality, instruction-following, and strongly consistent editing
data to support model training. For model architecture design, we design a
hierarchical model framework consisting of a base model, pattern shifting
modules, and consistency enhancement modules. For model training, we adopt a
two-stage training strategy to enhance the consistency preservation: first
stage for editing pattern shifting, and second stage for consistency
enhancement. Each stage involves training different modules with separate
datasets. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations of TBStar-Edit on a
self-proposed e-commerce benchmark, and the results demonstrate that
TBStar-Edit outperforms existing general-domain editing models in both
objective metrics (VIE Score) and subjective user preference.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出异步扩散模型，通过为不同像素分配不同时间步，让提示相关区域比无关区域更渐进地降噪，从而利用更清晰的像素间上下文，显著改善文本到图像的对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型采用同步降噪，所有像素同时从随机噪声演化到清晰图像，导致提示相关区域只能参考相同噪声水平的无关区域，无法获得清晰上下文，最终损害文本到图像的对齐。

Method: 提出异步扩散模型框架，为不同像素分配不同时间步，重新制定逐像素降噪过程。通过动态调节单个像素的时间步调度，让提示相关区域比无关区域更渐进地降噪。

Result: 大量实验表明，异步扩散模型能显著改善各种提示下的文本到图像对齐效果。

Conclusion: 异步扩散模型通过异步降噪机制，让提示相关区域利用更清晰的像素间上下文，有效提升了文本到图像生成的对齐质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generating high-quality
images. Yet, they often struggle to faithfully align the generated images with
the input prompts. This limitation arises from synchronous denoising, where all
pixels simultaneously evolve from random noise to clear images. As a result,
during generation, the prompt-related regions can only reference the unrelated
regions at the same noise level, failing to obtain clear context and ultimately
impairing text-to-image alignment. To address this issue, we propose
asynchronous diffusion models -- a novel framework that allocates distinct
timesteps to different pixels and reformulates the pixel-wise denoising
process. By dynamically modulating the timestep schedules of individual pixels,
prompt-related regions are denoised more gradually than unrelated regions,
thereby allowing them to leverage clearer inter-pixel context. Consequently,
these prompt-related regions achieve better alignment in the final images.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our asynchronous diffusion models can
significantly improve text-to-image alignment across diverse prompts. The code
repository for this work is available at https://github.com/hu-zijing/AsynDM.

TL;DR: 提出TAG（切向放大引导）方法，通过放大估计分数的切向分量来校正采样轨迹，提高扩散模型生成质量，无需修改基础模型架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在图像生成中常出现语义不一致或幻觉问题，现有推理时引导方法依赖外部信号或架构修改，引入额外计算开销。

Method: 利用中间样本作为投影基，放大估计分数相对于该基的切向分量来校正采样轨迹，基于一阶泰勒展开形式化引导过程。

Result: TAG作为即插即用、架构无关的模块，以最小计算代价提高扩散采样保真度。

Conclusion: TAG提供了一种新的扩散引导视角，通过直接操作轨迹信号实现高效引导。

Abstract: Recent diffusion models achieve the state-of-the-art performance in image
generation, but often suffer from semantic inconsistencies or hallucinations.
While various inference-time guidance methods can enhance generation, they
often operate indirectly by relying on external signals or architectural
modifications, which introduces additional computational overhead. In this
paper, we propose Tangential Amplifying Guidance (TAG), a more efficient and
direct guidance method that operates solely on trajectory signals without
modifying the underlying diffusion model. TAG leverages an intermediate sample
as a projection basis and amplifies the tangential components of the estimated
scores with respect to this basis to correct the sampling trajectory. We
formalize this guidance process by leveraging a first-order Taylor expansion,
which demonstrates that amplifying the tangential component steers the state
toward higher-probability regions, thereby reducing inconsistencies and
enhancing sample quality. TAG is a plug-and-play, architecture-agnostic module
that improves diffusion sampling fidelity with minimal computational addition,
offering a new perspective on diffusion guidance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出条件表示学习（CRL）方法，通过LLM生成描述性文本来构建语义基础，然后利用VLM将图像表示投影到条件特征空间中，从而为任意用户指定的标准提取定制化表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表示学习方法学习的是主要捕捉主导语义的通用表示，可能与定制化下游任务不匹配。例如在动物栖息地分析中，研究人员优先考虑场景相关特征，而通用嵌入强调类别语义，导致结果不理想。现有方法需要监督微调，计算和标注成本高。

Method: CRL首先使用大语言模型（LLM）根据用户指定标准生成描述性文本来构建语义基础，然后利用视觉语言模型（VLM）将图像表示投影到这个条件特征空间中。

Result: 在分类和检索任务上的大量实验证明了所提CRL方法的优越性和通用性。

Conclusion: 条件表示学习能够为特定标准更好地捕捉语义，可用于多个定制化任务，解决了传统通用表示与定制任务不匹配的问题。

Abstract: Conventional representation learning methods learn a universal representation
that primarily captures dominant semantics, which may not always align with
customized downstream tasks. For instance, in animal habitat analysis,
researchers prioritize scene-related features, whereas universal embeddings
emphasize categorical semantics, leading to suboptimal results. As a solution,
existing approaches resort to supervised fine-tuning, which however incurs high
computational and annotation costs. In this paper, we propose Conditional
Representation Learning (CRL), aiming to extract representations tailored to
arbitrary user-specified criteria. Specifically, we reveal that the semantics
of a space are determined by its basis, thereby enabling a set of descriptive
words to approximate the basis for a customized feature space. Building upon
this insight, given a user-specified criterion, CRL first employs a large
language model (LLM) to generate descriptive texts to construct the semantic
basis, then projects the image representation into this conditional feature
space leveraging a vision-language model (VLM). The conditional representation
better captures semantics for the specific criterion, which could be utilized
for multiple customized tasks. Extensive experiments on classification and
retrieval tasks demonstrate the superiority and generality of the proposed CRL.

Conclusion: 该框架将日常查看器日志转化为可扩展的专家验证监督数据，使病理学智能体系统实用化，并建立了向人类对齐、可升级的临床AI发展路径。

Abstract: Diagnosing a whole-slide image is an interactive, multi-stage process
involving changes in magnification and movement between fields. Although recent
pathology foundation models are strong, practical agentic systems that decide
what field to examine next, adjust magnification, and deliver explainable
diagnoses are still lacking. The blocker is data: scalable, clinically aligned
supervision of expert viewing behavior that is tacit and experience-based, not
written in textbooks or online, and therefore absent from large language model
training. We introduce the AI Session Recorder, which works with standard WSI
viewers to unobtrusively record routine navigation and convert the viewer logs
into standardized behavioral commands (inspect or peek at discrete
magnifications) and bounding boxes. A lightweight human-in-the-loop review
turns AI-drafted rationales into the Pathology-CoT dataset, a form of paired
"where to look" and "why it matters" supervision produced at roughly six times
lower labeling time. Using this behavioral data, we build Pathologist-o3, a
two-stage agent that first proposes regions of interest and then performs
behavior-guided reasoning. On gastrointestinal lymph-node metastasis detection,
it achieved 84.5% precision, 100.0% recall, and 75.4% accuracy, exceeding the
state-of-the-art OpenAI o3 model and generalizing across backbones. To our
knowledge, this constitutes one of the first behavior-grounded agentic systems
in pathology. Turning everyday viewer logs into scalable, expert-validated
supervision, our framework makes agentic pathology practical and establishes a
path to human-aligned, upgradeable clinical AI.

Abstract: Deep learning-based methods have achieved significant success in remote
sensing Earth observation data analysis. Numerous feature fusion techniques
address multimodal remote sensing image classification by integrating global
and local features. However, these techniques often struggle to extract
structural and detail features from heterogeneous and redundant multimodal
images. With the goal of introducing frequency domain learning to model key and
sparse detail features, this paper introduces the spatial-spectral-frequency
interaction network (S$^2$Fin), which integrates pairwise fusion modules across
the spatial, spectral, and frequency domains. Specifically, we propose a
high-frequency sparse enhancement transformer that employs sparse
spatial-spectral attention to optimize the parameters of the high-frequency
filter. Subsequently, a two-level spatial-frequency fusion strategy is
introduced, comprising an adaptive frequency channel module that fuses
low-frequency structures with enhanced high-frequency details, and a
high-frequency resonance mask that emphasizes sharp edges via phase similarity.
In addition, a spatial-spectral attention fusion module further enhances
feature extraction at intermediate layers of the network. Experiments on four
benchmark multimodal datasets with limited labeled data demonstrate that
S$^2$Fin performs superior classification, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods. The code is available at https://github.com/HaoLiu-XDU/SSFin.

Abstract: Detecting manipulated media has now become a pressing issue with the recent
rise of deepfakes. Most existing approaches fail to generalize across diverse
datasets and generation techniques. We thus propose a novel ensemble framework,
combining the strengths of transformer-based architectures, such as Swin
Transformers and ViTs, and texture-based methods, to achieve better detection
accuracy and robustness. Our method introduces innovative data-splitting,
sequential training, frequency splitting, patch-based attention, and face
segmentation techniques to handle dataset imbalances, enhance high-impact
regions (e.g., eyes and mouth), and improve generalization. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance when tested on the DFWild-Cup dataset, a diverse
subset of eight deepfake datasets. The ensemble benefits from the
complementarity of these approaches, with transformers excelling in global
feature extraction and texturebased methods providing interpretability. This
work demonstrates that hybrid models can effectively address the evolving
challenges of deepfake detection, offering a robust solution for real-world
applications.

including environmental monitoring through remote sensing. In the context of
the ForestEyes project, which combines citizen science and machine learning to
detect deforestation in tropical forests, image segments are used for labeling
by volunteers and subsequent model training. Traditionally, the Simple Linear
Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm is adopted as the segmentation method.
However, recent studies have indicated that other superpixel-based methods
outperform SLIC in remote sensing image segmentation, and might suggest that
they are more suitable for the task of detecting deforested areas. In this
sense, this study investigated the impact of the four best segmentation
methods, together with SLIC, on the training of classifiers for the target
application. Initially, the results showed little variation in performance
among segmentation methods, even when selecting the top five classifiers using
the PyCaret AutoML library. However, by applying a classifier fusion approach
(ensemble of classifiers), noticeable improvements in balanced accuracy were
observed, highlighting the importance of both the choice of segmentation method
and the combination of machine learning-based models for deforestation
detection tasks.

### [124] [EduPersona: Benchmarking Subjective Ability Boundaries of Virtual Student Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04648)
*Buyuan Zhu,Shiyu Hu,Yiping Ma,Yuanming Zhang,Kang Hao Cheong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EduPersona是一个大规模教育基准，专注于评估语言模型在课堂模拟中的主观能力，包含多语言、多学科、多人物类型的对话数据集，并建立了三阶段评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在教育中的应用日益增多，虚拟学生代理对课堂模拟和教师培训至关重要，但其课堂导向的主观能力尚未得到充分评估，这限制了模型边界理解和可信部署。

Method: 构建包含1,308个真实课堂对话轮次的大规模数据集，基于大五人格理论扩展至128k轮次；建立三阶段评估框架：基本连贯性、学生真实性和长期人格一致性；在三个代表性LLM上进行系统实验，比较原始版本与在EduPersona上微调的十个变体。

Result: 在所有任务上都显示出显著且一致的平均改进：TASK1 +33.6%、TASK2 +30.6%、TASK3 +14.9%，证明了数据集的有效性和研究价值，同时揭示了人格建模的异质性难度。

Conclusion: EduPersona提供了首个专注于主观能力的课堂基准，建立了可解耦和可验证的研究范式，将开源数据集和框架以支持教育领域可信和类人AI的发展。

Abstract: As large language models are increasingly integrated into education, virtual
student agents are becoming vital for classroom simulation and teacher
training. Yet their classroom-oriented subjective abilities remain largely
unassessed, limiting understanding of model boundaries and hindering
trustworthy deployment. We present EduPersona, a large-scale benchmark spanning
two languages, three subjects, and ten persona types based on the Big Five
theory. The dataset contains 1,308 authentic classroom dialogue rounds,
corresponding to 12,814 teacher-student Q&A turns, and is further expanded
through persona stylization into roughly 10 times larger scale (128k turns),
providing a solid foundation for evaluation. Building on this resource, we
decompose hard-to-quantify subjective performance into three progressive tasks:
TASK1 basic coherence (whether behavior, emotion, expression, and voice align
with classroom context), TASK2 student realism, and TASK3 long-term persona
consistency, thereby establishing an evaluation framework grounded in
educational theory and research value. We conduct systematic experiments on
three representative LLMs, comparing their original versions with ten
persona-fine-tuned variants trained on EduPersona. Results show consistent and
significant average improvements across all tasks: TASK1 +33.6%, TASK2 +30.6%,
and TASK3 +14.9%. These improvements highlight the dataset's effectiveness and
research value, while also revealing the heterogeneous difficulty of persona
modeling. In summary, EduPersona delivers the first classroom benchmark
centered on subjective abilities, establishes a decoupled and verifiable
research paradigm, and we will open-source both the dataset and the framework
to support the broader research community in advancing trustworthy and
human-like AI for education.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层多阶段运动专家混合（MoME）架构，用于从步态序列中预测心理特征，在PsyMo基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 步态蕴含丰富的生物特征和行为信息，但利用行走方式来推断心理特征仍是一个具有挑战性且未被充分探索的问题。

Method: 使用分层多阶段运动专家混合架构，将行走周期分为四个运动复杂度阶段，采用轻量级专家模型提取时空特征，并通过任务特定门控模块自适应加权不同特征和阶段。

Result: 在涵盖17个心理特征的PsyMo基准测试中，该方法优于最先进的步态分析模型，在运行级别获得37.47%的加权F1分数，在受试者级别获得44.6%。

Conclusion: 多任务步态学习在心理特征估计方面具有可行性，为未来基于运动信息的心理推断研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Gait encodes rich biometric and behavioural information, yet leveraging the
manner of walking to infer psychological traits remains a challenging and
underexplored problem. We introduce a hierarchical Multi-Stage Mixture of
Movement Experts (MoME) architecture for multi-task prediction of psychological
attributes from gait sequences represented as 2D poses. MoME processes the
walking cycle in four stages of movement complexity, employing lightweight
expert models to extract spatio-temporal features and task-specific gating
modules to adaptively weight experts across traits and stages. Evaluated on the
PsyMo benchmark covering 17 psychological traits, our method outperforms
state-of-the-art gait analysis models, achieving a 37.47% weighted F1 score at
the run level and 44.6% at the subject level. Our experiments show that
integrating auxiliary tasks such as identity recognition, gender prediction,
and BMI estimation further improves psychological trait estimation. Our
findings demonstrate the viability of multi-task gait-based learning for
psychological trait estimation and provide a foundation for future research on
movement-informed psychological inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多概念个性化中，多个学习的概念在输出图像中会产生不希望的干扰或混合，即"概念混合"问题。

Method: 提出ConceptSplit框架：1) Token-wise Value Adaptation (ToVA) - 仅调整交叉注意力中的值投影的训练方法；2) Latent Optimization for Disentangled Attention (LODA) - 通过优化输入潜变量来缓解注意力纠缠的推理方法。

Result: 通过广泛的定性和定量实验证明，ConceptSplit实现了鲁棒的多概念个性化，减轻了不期望的概念干扰。

Conclusion: ConceptSplit通过创新的训练和推理方法有效解决了多概念个性化中的概念混合问题。

Abstract: In recent years, multi-concept personalization for text-to-image (T2I)
diffusion models to represent several subjects in an image has gained much more
attention. The main challenge of this task is "concept mixing", where multiple
learned concepts interfere or blend undesirably in the output image. To address
this issue, in this paper, we present ConceptSplit, a novel framework to split
the individual concepts through training and inference. Our framework comprises
two key components. First, we introduce Token-wise Value Adaptation (ToVA), a
merging-free training method that focuses exclusively on adapting the value
projection in cross-attention. Based on our empirical analysis, we found that
modifying the key projection, a common approach in existing methods, can
disrupt the attention mechanism and lead to concept mixing. Second, we propose
Latent Optimization for Disentangled Attention (LODA), which alleviates
attention entanglement during inference by optimizing the input latent. Through
extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that
ConceptSplit achieves robust multi-concept personalization, mitigating
unintended concept interference. Code is available at

Motivation: 多期相MRI中肝脏分割对于肝纤维化评估至关重要，但标记数据稀缺且在不同成像模态和厂商系统间分布不均，同时存在空间错位和缺失期相等现实挑战。

Method: 整合基础规模3D分割主干网络（通过微调适配）、使用交叉伪监督的协同训练来利用未标记数据，以及标准化预处理流程，无需空间配准。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了结合基础模型适配与协同训练在现实临床成像任务中的潜力，为多期相多厂商MRI肝脏分割提供了有效的标签高效基线。

Abstract: Accurate liver segmentation in multi-phase MRI is vital for liver fibrosis
assessment, yet labeled data is often scarce and unevenly distributed across
imaging modalities and vendor systems. We propose a label-efficient
segmentation approach that promotes cross-modality generalization under
real-world conditions, where GED4 hepatobiliary-phase annotations are limited,
non-contrast sequences (T1WI, T2WI, DWI) are unlabeled, and spatial
misalignment and missing phases are common. Our method integrates a
foundation-scale 3D segmentation backbone adapted via fine-tuning, co-training
with cross pseudo supervision to leverage unlabeled volumes, and a standardized
preprocessing pipeline. Without requiring spatial registration, the model
learns to generalize across MRI phases and vendors, demonstrating robust
segmentation performance in both labeled and unlabeled domains. Our results
exhibit the effectiveness of our proposed label-efficient baseline for liver
segmentation in multi-phase, multi-vendor MRI and highlight the potential of
combining foundation model adaptation with co-training for real-world clinical
imaging tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架在保持身份一致性的同时实现了精细的表情控制，能够处理从基础情感到微表情的各种表情变化，并支持真实图像的表情编辑。

Abstract: Human-centric generative models designed for AI-driven storytelling must
bring together two core capabilities: identity consistency and precise control
over human performance. While recent diffusion-based approaches have made
significant progress in maintaining facial identity, achieving fine-grained
expression control without compromising identity remains challenging. In this
work, we present a diffusion-based framework that faithfully reimagines any
subject under any particular facial expression. Building on an ID-consistent
face foundation model, we adopt a compositional design featuring an expression
cross-attention module guided by FLAME blendshape parameters for explicit
control. Trained on a diverse mixture of image and video data rich in
expressive variation, our adapter generalizes beyond basic emotions to subtle
micro-expressions and expressive transitions, overlooked by prior works. In
addition, a pluggable Reference Adapter enables expression editing in real
images by transferring the appearance from a reference frame during synthesis.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our model
outperforms existing methods in tailored and identity-consistent expression
generation. Code and models can be found at

Motivation: 现有方法无法建模真实人类反应中的随机性和动态特性，导致生成的面部反应缺乏多样性和自然度。

Method: 提出ReactDiff框架，在扩散过程中融入两个关键先验：时间面部行为运动学和面部动作单元依赖关系，以引导模型生成符合人类面部解剖约束的平滑连贯反应。

Conclusion: ReactDiff通过融入面部运动学先验，成功解决了面部反应生成中的多样性和自然度问题，为人类-计算机交互系统提供了更真实的交互体验。

Abstract: The automatic generation of diverse and human-like facial reactions in dyadic
dialogue remains a critical challenge for human-computer interaction systems.
Existing methods fail to model the stochasticity and dynamics inherent in real
human reactions. To address this, we propose ReactDiff, a novel temporal
diffusion framework for generating diverse facial reactions that are
appropriate for responding to any given dialogue context. Our key insight is
that plausible human reactions demonstrate smoothness, and coherence over time,
and conform to constraints imposed by human facial anatomy. To achieve this,
ReactDiff incorporates two vital priors (spatio-temporal facial kinematics)
into the diffusion process: i) temporal facial behavioral kinematics and ii)
facial action unit dependencies. These two constraints guide the model toward
realistic human reaction manifolds, avoiding visually unrealistic jitters,
unstable transitions, unnatural expressions, and other artifacts. Extensive
experiments on the REACT2024 dataset demonstrate that our approach not only
achieves state-of-the-art reaction quality but also excels in diversity and
reaction appropriateness.

Motivation: 现有方法在3D语义场景图预测中过度依赖图神经网络，但物体和关系特征的表示能力不足，导致整体性能受限。研究发现物体特征质量对场景图准确性至关重要。

Method: 设计了高区分度的物体特征编码器，采用对比预训练策略将物体表示学习与场景图预测解耦，并有效结合几何和语义特征进行关系预测。

Result: 在3DSSG数据集上的实验表明，该方法在所有评估指标上均显著优于现有最先进方法，将预训练编码器插入现有框架也能带来实质性性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过优化物体特征表示并有效整合关系信息，该方法在3D语义场景图预测任务中取得了突破性进展，为机器人和AR/VR应用提供了重要技术支撑。

Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Graph Prediction aims to detect objects and their semantic
relationships in 3D scenes, and has emerged as a crucial technology for
robotics and AR/VR applications. While previous research has addressed dataset
limitations and explored various approaches including Open-Vocabulary settings,
they frequently fail to optimize the representational capacity of object and
relationship features, showing excessive reliance on Graph Neural Networks
despite insufficient discriminative capability. In this work, we demonstrate
through extensive analysis that the quality of object features plays a critical
role in determining overall scene graph accuracy. To address this challenge, we
design a highly discriminative object feature encoder and employ a contrastive
pretraining strategy that decouples object representation learning from the
scene graph prediction. This design not only enhances object classification
accuracy but also yields direct improvements in relationship prediction.
Notably, when plugging in our pretrained encoder into existing frameworks, we
observe substantial performance improvements across all evaluation metrics.
Additionally, whereas existing approaches have not fully exploited the
integration of relationship information, we effectively combine both geometric
and semantic features to achieve superior relationship prediction.
Comprehensive experiments on the 3DSSG dataset demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/VisualScienceLab-KHU/OCRL-3DSSG-Codes.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个野生动物监测条件下的单目度量深度估计基准，评估了四种最先进的深度估计方法在相机陷阱图像上的性能，发现Depth Anything V2在精度和速度方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机陷阱广泛用于野生动物监测，但从单目图像中提取准确距离测量仍然具有挑战性，因为缺乏深度信息。虽然单目深度估计方法已有显著进展，但它们在自然野生动物环境中的性能尚未得到系统评估。

Method: 在93张带有校准ChARUCO图案获取真实距离的相机陷阱图像上，评估了四种最先进的单目深度估计方法（Depth Anything V2、ML Depth Pro、ZoeDepth和Metric3D）以及几何基线方法。

Result: Depth Anything V2实现了最佳整体性能，平均绝对误差为0.454m，相关性为0.962；而ZoeDepth在户外自然环境中表现显著下降（MAE：3.087m）。中值深度提取在所有深度学习方法中始终优于均值方法。ZoeDepth速度最快（每张图像0.17秒）但精度最低，Depth Anything V2在精度和速度之间提供了最佳平衡（每张图像0.22秒）。

Conclusion: 该基准为野生动物应用建立了性能基线，并为在保护监测系统中实施深度估计提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Camera traps are widely used for wildlife monitoring, but extracting accurate
distance measurements from monocular images remains challenging due to the lack
of depth information. While monocular depth estimation (MDE) methods have
advanced significantly, their performance in natural wildlife environments has
not been systematically evaluated. This work introduces the first benchmark for
monocular metric depth estimation in wildlife monitoring conditions. We
evaluate four state-of-the-art MDE methods (Depth Anything V2, ML Depth Pro,
ZoeDepth, and Metric3D) alongside a geometric baseline on 93 camera trap images
with ground truth distances obtained using calibrated ChARUCO patterns. Our
results demonstrate that Depth Anything V2 achieves the best overall
performance with a mean absolute error of 0.454m and correlation of 0.962,
while methods like ZoeDepth show significant degradation in outdoor natural
environments (MAE: 3.087m). We find that median-based depth extraction
consistently outperforms mean-based approaches across all deep learning
methods. Additionally, we analyze computational efficiency, with ZoeDepth being
fastest (0.17s per image) but least accurate, while Depth Anything V2 provides
an optimal balance of accuracy and speed (0.22s per image). This benchmark
establishes performance baselines for wildlife applications and provides
practical guidance for implementing depth estimation in conservation monitoring
systems.

Abstract: Quantifying sponsor visibility in sports broadcasts is a critical marketing
task traditionally hindered by manual, subjective, and unscalable analysis
methods. While automated systems offer an alternative, their reliance on
axis-aligned Horizontal Bounding Box (HBB) leads to inaccurate exposuremetrics
when logos appear rotated or skewed due to dynamic camera angles and
perspective distortions. This paper introduces ExposureEngine, an end-to-end
system designed for accurate, rotation-aware sponsor visibility analytics in
sports broadcasts, demonstrated in a soccer case study. Our approach predicts
Oriented Bounding Box (OBB) to provide a geometrically precise fit to each logo
regardless of the orientation on-screen. To train and evaluate our detector, we
developed a new dataset comprising 1,103 frames from Swedish elite soccer,
featuring 670 unique sponsor logos annotated with OBBs. Our model achieves a
mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.859, with a precision of 0.96 and recall
of 0.87, demonstrating robust performance in localizing logos under diverse
broadcast conditions. The system integrates these detections into an analytical
pipeline that calculates precise visibility metrics, such as exposure duration
and on-screen coverage. Furthermore, we incorporate a language-driven agentic
layer, enabling users to generate reports, summaries, and media content through
natural language queries. The complete system, including the dataset and the
analytics dashboard, provides a comprehensive solution for auditable and
interpretable sponsor measurement in sports media. An overview of the
ExposureEngine is available online: https://youtu.be/tRw6OBISuW4 .

Method: 在YOLO检测头中集成统计异常检测测试，将小目标视为背景的异常模式。

Result: 在多个IRSTD基准测试中取得竞争性性能，在有限训练数据、噪声和领域偏移场景下表现出显著鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AA-YOLO具有高度通用性，可应用于各种YOLO骨干网络，包括轻量级模型，是资源受限实际部署的有吸引力的解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared Small Target Detection (IRSTD) is a challenging task in defense
applications, where complex backgrounds and tiny target sizes often result in
numerous false alarms using conventional object detectors. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Anomaly-Aware YOLO (AA-YOLO), which integrates a
statistical anomaly detection test into its detection head. By treating small
targets as unexpected patterns against the background, AA-YOLO effectively
controls the false alarm rate. Our approach not only achieves competitive
performance on several IRSTD benchmarks, but also demonstrates remarkable
robustness in scenarios with limited training data, noise, and domain shifts.
Furthermore, since only the detection head is modified, our design is highly
generic and has been successfully applied across various YOLO backbones,
including lightweight models. It also provides promising results when
integrated into an instance segmentation YOLO. This versatility makes AA-YOLO
an attractive solution for real-world deployments where resources are
constrained. The code will be publicly released.

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of transformer-based architectures
for person identification in natural, face-to-face conversation scenario. We
implement and evaluate a two-stream framework that separately models spatial
configurations and temporal motion patterns of 133 COCO WholeBody keypoints,
extracted from a subset of the CANDOR conversational corpus. Our experiments
compare pre-trained and from-scratch training, investigate the use of velocity

significantly outperforms transfer learning, and that spatial configurations
carry more discriminative information than temporal dynamics. The spatial
transformer achieves 95.74% accuracy, while the multi-scale temporal
transformer achieves 93.90%. Feature-level fusion pushes performance to 98.03%,

Result: 在3D占用预测任务中实现了最先进的性能，相比之前最佳方法相对提升了14.3%的mIoU。

Conclusion: PG-Occ框架有效平衡了计算效率和细节捕捉能力，为开放词汇3D场景理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The 3D occupancy prediction task has witnessed remarkable progress in recent
years, playing a crucial role in vision-based autonomous driving systems. While
traditional methods are limited to fixed semantic categories, recent approaches
have moved towards predicting text-aligned features to enable open-vocabulary
text queries in real-world scenes. However, there exists a trade-off in
text-aligned scene modeling: sparse Gaussian representation struggles to
capture small objects in the scene, while dense representation incurs
significant computational overhead. To address these limitations, we present
PG-Occ, an innovative Progressive Gaussian Transformer Framework that enables
open-vocabulary 3D occupancy prediction. Our framework employs progressive
online densification, a feed-forward strategy that gradually enhances the 3D
Gaussian representation to capture fine-grained scene details. By iteratively
enhancing the representation, the framework achieves increasingly precise and
detailed scene understanding. Another key contribution is the introduction of
an anisotropy-aware sampling strategy with spatio-temporal fusion, which
adaptively assigns receptive fields to Gaussians at different scales and
stages, enabling more effective feature aggregation and richer scene
information capture. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that PG-Occ
achieves state-of-the-art performance with a relative 14.3% mIoU improvement
over the previous best performing method. Code and pretrained models will be
released upon publication on our project page:

Conclusion: 通过生成未见类数据可以有效估计开放环境分布，提出的方法在开放词汇学习中表现出优越的有效性和性能

Abstract: Open-vocabulary learning requires modeling the data distribution in open
environments, which consists of both seen-class and unseen-class data.
  Existing methods estimate the distribution in open environments using
seen-class data, where the absence of unseen classes makes the estimation error
inherently unidentifiable.
  Intuitively, learning beyond the seen classes is crucial for distribution
estimation to bound the estimation error.
  We theoretically demonstrate that the distribution can be effectively
estimated by generating unseen-class data, through which the estimation error
is upper-bounded.
  Building on this theoretical insight, we propose a novel open-vocabulary
learning method, which generates unseen-class data for estimating the
distribution in open environments. The method consists of a class-domain-wise
data generation pipeline and a distribution alignment algorithm. The data
generation pipeline generates unseen-class data under the guidance of a
hierarchical semantic tree and domain information inferred from the seen-class
data, facilitating accurate distribution estimation. With the generated data,
the distribution alignment algorithm estimates and maximizes the posterior
probability to enhance generalization in open-vocabulary learning. Extensive
experiments on $11$ datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline

TL;DR: FedSurg挑战赛评估了联邦学习在手术视频分类中的表现，重点关注模型在未见临床中心的泛化能力和本地微调后的适应能力。最佳表现基于ViViT架构，结果显示泛化能力有限但微调后均有改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立首个手术视频分类联邦学习基准，评估现有方法在跨临床中心泛化和本地适应方面的表现，同时保护患者数据隐私。

Method: 参与者使用Appendix300数据集开发策略，包括基础模型线性探测、度量学习（三元组损失）和多种联邦聚合方案（FedAvg、FedMedian、FedSAM）。评估基于F1分数和期望成本，通过自助法和统计检验评估排名稳定性。

Result: 泛化任务中跨中心性能有限；适应任务中所有团队微调后均有改进，但排名稳定性低。ViViT提交表现最佳。挑战揭示了泛化局限性、类别不平衡敏感性和去中心化训练中超参数调优困难。

Conclusion: FedSurg挑战赛建立了手术视频分类联邦学习的首个基准，强调了本地个性化与全局鲁棒性之间的权衡，以及架构选择、预处理和损失设计的重要性，为未来开发不平衡感知、自适应和鲁棒的临床手术AI联邦学习方法提供了参考。

Abstract: Purpose: The FedSurg challenge was designed to benchmark the state of the art
in federated learning for surgical video classification. Its goal was to assess
how well current methods generalize to unseen clinical centers and adapt
through local fine-tuning while enabling collaborative model development
without sharing patient data. Methods: Participants developed strategies to
classify inflammation stages in appendicitis using a preliminary version of the
multi-center Appendix300 video dataset. The challenge evaluated two tasks:
generalization to an unseen center and center-specific adaptation after
fine-tuning. Submitted approaches included foundation models with linear
probing, metric learning with triplet loss, and various FL aggregation schemes
(FedAvg, FedMedian, FedSAM). Performance was assessed using F1-score and
Expected Cost, with ranking robustness evaluated via bootstrapping and
statistical testing. Results: In the generalization task, performance across
centers was limited. In the adaptation task, all teams improved after
fine-tuning, though ranking stability was low. The ViViT-based submission
achieved the strongest overall performance. The challenge highlighted
limitations in generalization, sensitivity to class imbalance, and difficulties
in hyperparameter tuning in decentralized training, while spatiotemporal
modeling and context-aware preprocessing emerged as promising strategies.
Conclusion: The FedSurg Challenge establishes the first benchmark for
evaluating FL strategies in surgical video classification. Findings highlight
the trade-off between local personalization and global robustness, and
underscore the importance of architecture choice, preprocessing, and loss
design. This benchmarking offers a reference point for future development of
imbalance-aware, adaptive, and robust FL methods in clinical surgical AI.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动化双机器人3D扫描系统，通过协调机器人操作和高分辨率扫描，实现了文化遗产文物的高质量数字化，无需手动或半自动工作流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D扫描方法需要专业知识和手动干预来维持最佳扫描条件和覆盖范围，这限制了文化遗产数字化的效率和可及性。

Method: 将扫描空间参数化为不同区域，使用扫描机器人（配备扫描仪）和托盘处理机器人进行协调运动规划，通过优化的轨迹规划和路径点分布确保全面表面覆盖。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法相比基线方法显著降低了Chamfer Distance，提高了F-score，在几何精度、数字化效率和减少对专家操作依赖方面表现优越。

Conclusion: 该自动化双机器人系统为文化遗产文物的高保真3D数字化提供了一种高效、准确的解决方案，显著减少了人工干预需求。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D scanning is essential for preserving cultural heritage
artefacts, supporting documentation, analysis, and long-term conservation.
However, conventional methods typically require specialized expertise and
manual intervention to maintain optimal scanning conditions and coverage. We
present an automated two-robot scanning system that eliminates the need for
handheld or semi-automatic workflows by combining coordinated robotic
manipulation with high-resolution 3D scanning. Our system parameterizes the
scanning space into distinct regions, enabling coordinated motion planning
between a scanner-equipped robot and a tray-handling robot. Optimized
trajectory planning and waypoint distribution ensure comprehensive surface
coverage, minimize occlusions, and balance reconstruction accuracy with system
efficiency. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significantly
lower Chamfer Distance and higher F-score compared to baseline methods,
offering superior geometric accuracy, improved digitization efficiency, and
reduced reliance on expert operators.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统比较了ViT和CNN在几何估计任务中的表现，发现在大数据场景下ViT表现更好，但在小数据场景下CNN的归纳偏置使其能与ViT匹敌，且ViT在跨域评估中泛化能力更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究预训练视觉模型（ViT和CNN）在几何估计任务中的效率，特别是在低数据量场景下，这些任务需要平衡局部和全局特征，而预训练模型主要关注高级语义。

Method: 系统比较大规模CNN（ResNet、EfficientNet、CLIP-ResNet）与ViT基础模型（CLIP-ViT变体和DINO）在不同数据量设置下的表现，包括少样本场景。

Result: 在大数据场景下ViT优于CNN，但在小数据场景下CNN的归纳偏置使其性能与ViT相当，且ViT在跨域评估中表现出更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 需要根据具体场景谨慎选择模型架构进行微调，未来研究应关注平衡局部和全局表示的混合架构。

Abstract: Vision-transformers (ViTs) and large-scale convolution-neural-networks (CNNs)
have reshaped computer vision through pretrained feature representations that
enable strong transfer learning for diverse tasks. However, their efficiency as
backbone architectures for geometric estimation tasks involving image
deformations in low-data regimes remains an open question. This work considers
two such tasks: 1) estimating 2D rigid transformations between pairs of images
and 2) predicting the fundamental matrix for stereo image pairs, an important
problem in various applications, such as autonomous mobility, robotics, and 3D
scene reconstruction. Addressing this intriguing question, this work
systematically compares large-scale CNNs (ResNet, EfficientNet, CLIP-ResNet)
with ViT-based foundation models (CLIP-ViT variants and DINO) in various data
size settings, including few-shot scenarios. These pretrained models are
optimized for classification or contrastive learning, encouraging them to focus
mostly on high-level semantics. The considered tasks require balancing local
and global features differently, challenging the straightforward adoption of
these models as the backbone. Empirical comparative analysis shows that,
similar to training from scratch, ViTs outperform CNNs during refinement in
large downstream-data scenarios. However, in small data scenarios, the
inductive bias and smaller capacity of CNNs improve their performance, allowing
them to match that of a ViT. Moreover, ViTs exhibit stronger generalization in
cross-domain evaluation where the data distribution changes. These results
emphasize the importance of carefully selecting model architectures for
refinement, motivating future research towards hybrid architectures that
balance local and global representations.

TL;DR: DiT-VTON是一个基于扩散变换器的新型虚拟试穿框架，通过多种配置探索最佳图像条件设置，在扩展数据集上训练以增强鲁棒性，支持多种产品类别和高级图像编辑功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿模型在细节保留、真实图像鲁棒性、高效采样、图像编辑能力和跨品类泛化方面存在挑战，需要开发更强大的解决方案。

Method: 利用扩散变换器适应图像条件虚拟试穿任务，系统探索多种配置（上下文标记连接、通道连接、ControlNet集成），在扩展数据集上训练以增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在VITON-HD数据集上超越最先进方法，实现更优的细节保留和鲁棒性，无需额外条件编码器；在涵盖数千产品类别的多样化数据集上优于具有VTA和图像编辑能力的模型。

Conclusion: DiT-VTON重新定义了虚拟试穿任务，提供通用的虚拟试穿解决方案，支持广泛产品类别和高级图像编辑功能，展示了数据扩展对VTO适应性的益处。

Abstract: The rapid growth of e-commerce has intensified the demand for Virtual Try-On
(VTO) technologies, enabling customers to realistically visualize products
overlaid on their own images. Despite recent advances, existing VTO models face
challenges with fine-grained detail preservation, robustness to real-world
imagery, efficient sampling, image editing capabilities, and generalization
across diverse product categories. In this paper, we present DiT-VTON, a novel
VTO framework that leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), renowned for its
performance on text-conditioned image generation, adapted here for the
image-conditioned VTO task. We systematically explore multiple DiT
configurations, including in-context token concatenation, channel
concatenation, and ControlNet integration, to determine the best setup for VTO
image conditioning.
  To enhance robustness, we train the model on an expanded dataset encompassing
varied backgrounds, unstructured references, and non-garment categories,
demonstrating the benefits of data scaling for VTO adaptability. DiT-VTON also
redefines the VTO task beyond garment try-on, offering a versatile Virtual
Try-All (VTA) solution capable of handling a wide range of product categories
and supporting advanced image editing functionalities such as pose
preservation, localized editing, texture transfer, and object-level
customization. Experimental results show that our model surpasses
state-of-the-art methods on VITON-HD, achieving superior detail preservation
and robustness without reliance on additional condition encoders. It also
outperforms models with VTA and image editing capabilities on a diverse dataset
spanning thousands of product categories.

TL;DR: EgoSurg是一个从固定摄像头视频重建手术室人员动态自我中心视角回放的框架，无需干扰临床工作流程，为沉浸式手术数据科学提供新基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手术观察依赖固定视角或回忆，无法记录指导临床决策的自我中心视觉视角。固定摄像头视频只能捕捉房间尺度的工作流程，但无法重建每个团队成员实际看到的内容。

Method: EgoSurg结合几何驱动的神经渲染和基于扩散的视图增强，能够在任意时刻合成任意和自我中心视角的高视觉保真度图像。

Result: 在多站点手术案例和受控研究的评估中，EgoSurg能够以高视觉质量和保真度重建特定人员的视觉场和任意视角。

Conclusion: 通过将现有手术室摄像头基础设施转变为可导航的动态3D记录，EgoSurg为沉浸式手术数据科学建立了新基础，使手术实践能够从各个角度可视化、体验和分析。

Abstract: Observing surgical practice has historically relied on fixed vantage points
or recollections, leaving the egocentric visual perspectives that guide
clinical decisions undocumented. Fixed-camera video can capture surgical
workflows at the room-scale, but cannot reconstruct what each team member
actually saw. Thus, these videos only provide limited insights into how
decisions that affect surgical safety, training, and workflow optimization are
made. Here we introduce EgoSurg, the first framework to reconstruct the
dynamic, egocentric replays for any operating room (OR) staff directly from
wall-mounted fixed-camera video, and thus, without intervention to clinical
workflow. EgoSurg couples geometry-driven neural rendering with diffusion-based
view enhancement, enabling high-visual fidelity synthesis of arbitrary and
egocentric viewpoints at any moment. In evaluation across multi-site surgical
cases and controlled studies, EgoSurg reconstructs person-specific visual
fields and arbitrary viewpoints with high visual quality and fidelity. By
transforming existing OR camera infrastructure into a navigable dynamic 3D
record, EgoSurg establishes a new foundation for immersive surgical data
science, enabling surgical practice to be visualized, experienced, and analyzed
from every angle.

TL;DR: 论文通过分析多模态语言模型（MLMs）中的视觉键值令牌处理机制，揭示了MLMs在感知密集型任务上表现不佳的原因，并提出了改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有工作分析VIT编码器和transformer激活，但多模态语言模型在感知密集型任务上的表现不佳原因尚未被充分理解。本文从视觉键值令牌处理的角度提供新视角。

Method: 研究流行MLMs（LLaVA-OneVision、Qwen2.5-VL、Llama-3-LLaVA-NeXT）处理视觉键值令牌的方式，分析视觉信息在语言模型中的流动，并探索通过添加文本前缀来控制视觉信息的方法。

Result: 发现图像值令牌包含足够信息来执行多个感知密集型任务；语言模型确实增强了视觉信息，但包含的视觉信息少于未经MLM微调的视觉编码器；后期层中的图像键令牌包含降低感知能力的伪影；添加文本前缀能改善视觉表示；33.3%的BLINK基准艺术风格问题中，语言模型中的感知信息未被输出利用。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了键值令牌在多模态系统中的关键作用，为MLMs的机制可解释性提供了新见解，并提出了训练视觉编码器和语言模型组件的新方向。

Abstract: Despite interpretability work analyzing VIT encoders and transformer
activations, we don't yet understand why Multimodal Language Models (MLMs)
struggle on perception-heavy tasks. We offer an under-studied perspective by
examining how popular MLMs (LLaVA-OneVision, Qwen2.5-VL, and
Llama-3-LLaVA-NeXT) process their visual key-value tokens. We first study the
flow of visual information through the language model, finding that image value
tokens encode sufficient information to perform several perception-heavy tasks
zero-shot: segmentation, semantic correspondence, temporal correspondence, and
referring expression detection. We find that while the language model does
augment the visual information received from the projection of input visual
encodings-which we reveal correlates with overall MLM perception capability-it
contains less visual information on several tasks than the equivalent visual
encoder (SigLIP) that has not undergone MLM finetuning. Further, we find that
the visual information corresponding to input-agnostic image key tokens in
later layers of language models contains artifacts which reduce perception
capability of the overall MLM. Next, we discuss controlling visual information
in the language model, showing that adding a text prefix to the image input
improves perception capabilities of visual representations. Finally, we reveal
that if language models were able to better control their visual information,
their perception would significantly improve; e.g., in 33.3% of Art Style
questions in the BLINK benchmark, perception information present in the
language model is not surfaced to the output! Our findings reveal insights into
the role of key-value tokens in multimodal systems, paving the way for deeper
mechanistic interpretability of MLMs and suggesting new directions for training
their visual encoder and language model components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要多视角服装捕捉或物理先验，无法在单视角监督下支持动态服装交互。AvatarVTON旨在解决这一限制，实现更灵活的动态虚拟试穿。

Method: 框架包含两个关键模块：互易流校正器（无先验光流校正策略）和非线性变形器（将高斯图分解为视角姿态不变和特定组件）。

Result: 实验表明AvatarVTON实现了高保真度、多样性和动态服装真实感，在AR/VR、游戏和数字人应用中表现优异。

Conclusion: AvatarVTON为4D虚拟试穿建立了新基准，无需多视角数据或物理先验即可生成动态逼真的试穿效果。

Abstract: We propose AvatarVTON, the first 4D virtual try-on framework that generates
realistic try-on results from a single in-shop garment image, enabling free
pose control, novel-view rendering, and diverse garment choices. Unlike
existing methods, AvatarVTON supports dynamic garment interactions under
single-view supervision, without relying on multi-view garment captures or
physics priors. The framework consists of two key modules: (1) a Reciprocal
Flow Rectifier, a prior-free optical-flow correction strategy that stabilizes
avatar fitting and ensures temporal coherence; and (2) a Non-Linear Deformer,
which decomposes Gaussian maps into view-pose-invariant and view-pose-specific
components, enabling adaptive, non-linear garment deformations. To establish a
benchmark for 4D virtual try-on, we extend existing baselines with unified
modules for fair qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Extensive
experiments show that AvatarVTON achieves high fidelity, diversity, and dynamic
garment realism, making it well-suited for AR/VR, gaming, and digital-human
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成合成CT对于实现仅MRI和基于CBCT的自适应放疗至关重要，可以提高治疗精度同时减少患者辐射暴露。

Method: 采用完全3D流匹配框架，将高斯噪声体积通过学习的流匹配速度场转换为sCT图像，使用轻量级3D编码器从输入MRI或CBCT中提取特征进行条件化。

Result: 方法能够准确重建全局解剖结构，但由于内存和运行时间限制导致的训练分辨率较低，细部细节保留有限。

Conclusion: 未来工作将探索基于补丁的训练和潜在空间流模型，以提高分辨率和局部结构保真度。

Abstract: Generating synthetic CT (sCT) from MRI or CBCT plays a crucial role in
enabling MRI-only and CBCT-based adaptive radiotherapy, improving treatment
precision while reducing patient radiation exposure. To address this task, we
adopt a fully 3D Flow Matching (FM) framework, motivated by recent work
demonstrating FM's efficiency in producing high-quality images. In our
approach, a Gaussian noise volume is transformed into an sCT image by
integrating a learned FM velocity field, conditioned on features extracted from
the input MRI or CBCT using a lightweight 3D encoder. We evaluated the method
on the SynthRAD2025 Challenge benchmark, training separate models for MRI
$\rightarrow$ sCT and CBCT $\rightarrow$ sCT across three anatomical regions:
abdomen, head and neck, and thorax. Validation and testing were performed
through the challenge submission system. The results indicate that the method
accurately reconstructs global anatomical structures; however, preservation of
fine details was limited, primarily due to the relatively low training
resolution imposed by memory and runtime constraints. Future work will explore
patch-based training and latent-space flow models to improve resolution and
local structural fidelity.

TL;DR: 提出AT-BPTT框架，通过动态调整截断位置和窗口大小来改进数据集蒸馏中的内循环优化，相比随机截断方法平均提升6.16%准确率，同时加速3.9倍并节省63%内存。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集蒸馏方法中的内循环优化依赖随机截断策略，缺乏灵活性且效果不佳。研究发现神经网络在不同训练阶段具有不同的学习动态，随机截断无法有效适应这些变化。

Method: 提出自动截断反向传播时间（AT-BPTT）框架，包含三个关键组件：基于概率的阶段感知时间步选择机制、基于梯度变化的自适应窗口大小策略、以及用于降低计算开销的低秩Hessian近似。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、Tiny-ImageNet和ImageNet-1K上的实验表明，AT-BPTT达到最先进性能，平均准确率比基线方法提升6.16%，同时内循环优化加速3.9倍，内存成本节省63%。

Conclusion: AT-BPTT通过动态适应梯度行为来优化截断策略，显著提升了数据集蒸馏的性能和效率，为高效深度学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The growing demand for efficient deep learning has positioned dataset
distillation as a pivotal technique for compressing training dataset while
preserving model performance. However, existing inner-loop optimization methods
for dataset distillation typically rely on random truncation strategies, which
lack flexibility and often yield suboptimal results. In this work, we observe
that neural networks exhibit distinct learning dynamics across different
training stages-early, middle, and late-making random truncation ineffective.
To address this limitation, we propose Automatic Truncated Backpropagation
Through Time (AT-BPTT), a novel framework that dynamically adapts both
truncation positions and window sizes according to intrinsic gradient behavior.
AT-BPTT introduces three key components: (1) a probabilistic mechanism for
stage-aware timestep selection, (2) an adaptive window sizing strategy based on
gradient variation, and (3) a low-rank Hessian approximation to reduce
computational overhead. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K show that AT-BPTT achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving accuracy by an average of 6.16% over baseline methods.
Moreover, our approach accelerates inner-loop optimization by 3.9x while saving
63% memory cost.

Abstract: An accurate and up-to-date model of a photovoltaic (PV) power plant is
essential for its optimal operation and maintenance. However, such a model may
not be easily available. This work introduces a novel approach for PV power
plant mapping based on aerial overview images. It enables the automation of the
mapping process while removing the reliance on third-party data. The presented
mapping method takes advantage of the structural layout of the power plants to
achieve detailed modeling down to the level of individual PV modules. The
approach relies on visual segmentation of PV modules in overview images and the
inference of structural information in each image, assigning modules to
individual benches, rows, and columns. We identify visual keypoints related to
the layout and use these to merge detections from multiple images while
maintaining their structural integrity. The presented method was experimentally
verified and evaluated on two different power plants. The final fusion of 3D
positions and semantic structures results in a compact georeferenced model
suitable for power plant maintenance.

Conclusion: 该方法为增强强化学习驱动的人类-环境交互模拟提供了新途径，能够保护用户匿名性同时揭示反映认知和情感状态的潜在身体运动结构。

Abstract: Understanding the dynamic relationship between humans and the built
environment is a key challenge in disciplines ranging from environmental
psychology to reinforcement learning (RL). A central obstacle in modeling these
interactions is the inability to capture human psychological states in a way
that is both generalizable and privacy preserving. Traditional methods rely on
theoretical models or questionnaires, which are limited in scope, static, and
labor intensive. We present a kinesics recognition framework that infers the
communicative functions of human activity -- known as kinesics -- directly from
3D skeleton joint data. Combining a spatial-temporal graph convolutional
network (ST-GCN) with a convolutional neural network (CNN), the framework
leverages transfer learning to bypass the need for manually defined mappings
between physical actions and psychological categories. The approach preserves
user anonymity while uncovering latent structures in bodily movements that
reflect cognitive and emotional states. Our results on the Dyadic User
EngagemenT (DUET) dataset demonstrate that this method enables scalable,
accurate, and human-centered modeling of behavior, offering a new pathway for
enhancing RL-driven simulations of human-environment interaction.

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) integrate sensing, computing, and control to
improve infrastructure performance, focusing on economic goals like performance
and safety. However, they often neglect potential human-centered (or
''social'') benefits. Cyber-physical-social infrastructure systems (CPSIS) aim
to address this by aligning CPS with social objectives. This involves defining
social benefits, understanding human interactions with each other and
infrastructure, developing privacy-preserving measurement methods, modeling
these interactions for prediction, linking them to social benefits, and
actuating the physical environment to foster positive social outcomes. This
paper delves into recognizing dyadic human interactions using real-world data,
which is the backbone to measuring social behavior. This lays a foundation to
address the need to enhance understanding of the deeper meanings and mutual
responses inherent in human interactions. While RGB cameras are informative for
interaction recognition, privacy concerns arise. Depth sensors offer a
privacy-conscious alternative by analyzing skeletal movements. This study
compares five skeleton-based interaction recognition algorithms on a dataset of
12 dyadic interactions. Unlike single-person datasets, these interactions,
categorized into communication types like emblems and affect displays, offer
insights into the cultural and emotional aspects of human interactions.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在图像分类中表现出色，但计算成本高，难以应用于实时和边缘场景。需要开发能够在运行时动态调整压缩级别的技术。

Method: 将早期退出和知识蒸馏两种技术结合，训练简化的学生早期退出模型。创新性地为教师模型分类错误的图像引入基于熵的损失函数。

Conclusion: 该方法优化了准确性和效率之间的权衡，为知识蒸馏在其他场景中的应用开辟了新的研究视角。

Abstract: Although deep neural networks and in particular Convolutional Neural Networks
have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in image classification with
relatively high efficiency, they still exhibit high computational costs, often
rendering them impractical for real-time and edge applications. Therefore, a
multitude of compression techniques have been developed to reduce these costs
while maintaining accuracy. In addition, dynamic architectures have been
introduced to modulate the level of compression at execution time, which is a
desirable property in many resource-limited application scenarios. The proposed
method effectively integrates two well-established optimization techniques:
early exits and knowledge distillation, where a reduced student early-exit
model is trained from a more complex teacher early-exit model. The primary
contribution of this research lies in the approach for training the student
early-exit model. In comparison to the conventional Knowledge Distillation
loss, our approach incorporates a new entropy-based loss for images where the
teacher's classification was incorrect. The proposed method optimizes the

Abstract: Optical microscopy is one of the most widely used techniques in research
studies for life sciences and biomedicine. These applications require reliable
experimental pipelines to extract valuable knowledge from the measured samples
and must be supported by image quality assessment (IQA) to ensure correct
processing and analysis of the image data. IQA methods are implemented with
variable complexity. However, while most quality metrics have a straightforward
implementation, they might be time consuming and computationally expensive when
evaluating a large dataset. In addition, quality metrics are often designed for
well-defined image features and may be unstable for images out of the ideal
domain.
  To overcome these limitations, recent works have proposed deep learning-based
IQA methods, which can provide superior performance, increased generalizability
and fast prediction. Our method, named $\mathrm{\mu}$DeepIQA, is inspired by
previous studies and applies a deep convolutional neural network designed for
IQA on natural images to optical microscopy measurements. We retrained the same
architecture to predict individual quality metrics and global quality scores
for optical microscopy data. The resulting models provide fast and stable
predictions of image quality by generalizing quality estimation even outside
the ideal range of standard methods. In addition, $\mathrm{\mu}$DeepIQA
provides patch-wise prediction of image quality and can be used to visualize
spatially varying quality in a single image. Our study demonstrates that
optical microscopy-based studies can benefit from the generalizability of deep
learning models due to their stable performance in the presence of outliers,
the ability to assess small image patches, and rapid predictions.

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end, IoT-enabled robotic system for the
non-destructive, real-time, and spatially-resolved mapping of grape yield and
quality (Brix, Acidity) in vineyards. The system features a comprehensive
analytical pipeline that integrates two key modules: a high-performance model
for grape bunch detection and weight estimation, and a novel deep learning
framework for quality assessment from hyperspectral (HSI) data. A critical
barrier to in-field HSI is the ``domain shift" caused by variable illumination.
To overcome this, our quality assessment is powered by the Light-Invariant
Spectral Autoencoder (LISA), a domain-adversarial framework that learns
illumination-invariant features from uncalibrated data. We validated the
system's robustness on a purpose-built HSI dataset spanning three distinct
illumination domains: controlled artificial lighting (lab), and variable
natural sunlight captured in the morning and afternoon. Results show the
complete pipeline achieves a recall (0.82) for bunch detection and a $R^2$
(0.76) for weight prediction, while the LISA module improves quality prediction
generalization by over 20% compared to the baselines. By combining these robust
modules, the system successfully generates high-resolution, georeferenced data
of both grape yield and quality, providing actionable, data-driven insights for
precision viticulture.

Abstract: Benthic habitat mapping is fundamental for understanding marine ecosystems,
guiding conservation efforts, and supporting sustainable resource management.
Yet, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets limits the development and
benchmarking of machine learning models in this domain. This paper introduces a
thorough multi-modal dataset, comprising about a million side-scan sonar (SSS)
tiles collected along the coast of Catalonia (Spain), complemented by
bathymetric maps and a set of co-registered optical images from targeted
surveys using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Approximately \num{36000}
of the SSS tiles have been manually annotated with segmentation masks to enable
supervised fine-tuning of classification models. All the raw sensor data,
together with mosaics, are also released to support further exploration and
algorithm development. To address challenges in multi-sensor data fusion for
AUVs, we spatially associate optical images with corresponding SSS tiles,
facilitating self-supervised, cross-modal representation learning. Accompanying
open-source preprocessing and annotation tools are provided to enhance
accessibility and encourage research. This resource aims to establish a
standardized benchmark for underwater habitat mapping, promoting advancements
in autonomous seafloor classification and multi-sensor integration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在遥感图像分类中很重要，但预定义的标签层次结构经常被忽视，大多数方法只关注细粒度分类方案。

Method: 在深度网络架构中集成层次特定分类头，使用可训练层次矩阵以自监督方式学习层次结构，并引入层次共识机制确保概率分布一致性。

Result: 在三个具有不同层次复杂度的基准数据集上评估，使用不同骨干架构，实验结果显示该方法在指导网络学习和层次共识的鲁棒性方面都很有效。

Conclusion: SAHC方法能够有效利用层次分类任务的固有结构，在遥感图像分类任务中表现出良好的适应性和有效性。

Abstract: Deep learning has become increasingly important in remote sensing image
classification due to its ability to extract semantic information from complex
data. Classification tasks often include predefined label hierarchies that
represent the semantic relationships among classes. However, these hierarchies
are frequently overlooked, and most approaches focus only on fine-grained
classification schemes. In this paper, we present a novel Semantics-Aware
Hierarchical Consensus (SAHC) method for learning hierarchical features and
relationships by integrating hierarchy-specific classification heads within a
deep network architecture, each specialized in different degrees of class
granularity. The proposed approach employs trainable hierarchy matrices, which
guide the network through the learning of the hierarchical structure in a
self-supervised manner. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical consensus
mechanism to ensure consistent probability distributions across different
hierarchical levels. This mechanism acts as a weighted ensemble being able to
effectively leverage the inherent structure of the hierarchical classification
task. The proposed SAHC method is evaluated on three benchmark datasets with
different degrees of hierarchical complexity on different tasks, using distinct
backbone architectures to effectively emphasize its adaptability. Experimental
results show both the effectiveness of the proposed approach in guiding network
learning and the robustness of the hierarchical consensus for remote sensing
image classification tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE系统缺乏医学成像所需的领域特定约束，而解剖结构和区域疾病异质性对病理模式有重要影响，需要专门针对医学图像设计的专家网络框架。

Method: 利用解剖先验训练7个专门专家，每个负责不同肺叶和双侧肺组合；采用多模态门控机制整合放射组学生物标志物和深度学习特征来优化专家贡献权重。

Result: 在ILD分类中，放射组学引导的集成达到平均AUC 0.8646±0.0467，比SwinUNETR基线提升12.5%；下叶模型AUC达0.88-0.90，优于DL对应模型。

Conclusion: REN展示了强大的泛化能力和临床可解释性，为其他结构化医学成像应用提供了可扩展的解剖学指导方法。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have significantly contributed to
scalable machine learning by enabling specialized subnetworks to tackle complex
tasks efficiently. However, traditional MoE systems lack domain-specific
constraints essential for medical imaging, where anatomical structure and
regional disease heterogeneity strongly influence pathological patterns. Here,
we introduce Regional Expert Networks (REN), the first anatomically-informed
MoE framework tailored specifically for medical image classification. REN
leverages anatomical priors to train seven specialized experts, each dedicated
to distinct lung lobes and bilateral lung combinations, enabling precise
modeling of region-specific pathological variations. Multi-modal gating
mechanisms dynamically integrate radiomics biomarkers and deep learning (DL)
features (CNN, ViT, Mamba) to weight expert contributions optimally. Applied to
interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification, REN achieves consistently
superior performance: the radiomics-guided ensemble reached an average AUC of
0.8646 +/- 0.0467, a +12.5 percent improvement over the SwinUNETR baseline (AUC
0.7685, p = 0.031). Region-specific experts further revealed that lower-lobe
models achieved AUCs of 0.88-0.90, surpassing DL counterparts (CNN: 0.76-0.79)
and aligning with known disease progression patterns. Through rigorous
patient-level cross-validation, REN demonstrates strong generalizability and
clinical interpretability, presenting a scalable, anatomically-guided approach
readily extensible to other structured medical imaging applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NFPF框架，通过特定特征学习机器(SFLM)量化样本对模型性能的贡献，使用重构差异指标进行样本选择，在无监督主动学习中达到与监督方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习需要大量人工标注且迭代过程耗时，无监督主动学习(UAL)将标注负担转移到单次后选择步骤，但现有UAL方法性能不佳，主要依赖局部梯度评分，易受噪声影响且无法充分代表数据分布。

Method: 提出自然特征渐进框架(NFPF)，使用特定特征学习机器(SFLM)量化样本重要性，定义重构差异指标进行初始样本选择，实现真正的无监督主动学习范式。

Result: NFPF显著优于所有现有UAL方法，在视觉数据集上达到与监督AL方法相当的性能，消融研究和可视化证明了其优越性能、增强的鲁棒性和改进的数据分布覆盖。

Conclusion: NFPF通过革新样本重要性度量方式，实现了无监督主动学习的突破性进展，为减少人工标注依赖提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The effectiveness of modern deep learning models is predicated on the
availability of large-scale, human-annotated datasets, a process that is
notoriously expensive and time-consuming. While Active Learning (AL) offers a
strategic solution by labeling only the most informative and representative
data, its iterative nature still necessitates significant human involvement.
Unsupervised Active Learning (UAL) presents an alternative by shifting the
annotation burden to a single, post-selection step. Unfortunately, prevailing
UAL methods struggle to achieve state-of-the-art performance. These approaches
typically rely on local, gradient-based scoring for sample importance
estimation, which not only makes them vulnerable to ambiguous and noisy data
but also hinders their capacity to select samples that adequately represent the
full data distribution. Moreover, their use of shallow, one-shot linear
selection falls short of a true UAL paradigm. In this paper, we propose the
Natural Feature Progressive Framework (NFPF), a UAL method that revolutionizes
how sample importance is measured. At its core, NFPF employs a Specific Feature
Learning Machine (SFLM) to effectively quantify each sample's contribution to
model performance. We further utilize the SFLM to define a powerful
Reconstruction Difference metric for initial sample selection. Our
comprehensive experiments show that NFPF significantly outperforms all
established UAL methods and achieves performance on par with supervised AL
methods on vision datasets. Detailed ablation studies and qualitative
visualizations provide compelling evidence for NFPF's superior performance,
enhanced robustness, and improved data distribution coverage.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CA3D-Diff是一种基于条件扩散模型的双向乳腺X光片视图转换框架，通过柱感知交叉注意力和隐式3D结构重建来解决乳腺X光片中由于大变形和组织重叠导致的视图间结构不对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实临床工作流中，乳腺X光片的CC和MLO视图可能由于采集错误或压缩伪影而缺失或损坏，限制了后续分析的效率。视图间转换可以帮助恢复缺失视图并改善病灶对齐，但由于X射线投影中的大非刚性变形和严重组织重叠，这一任务极具挑战性。

Method: 提出CA3D-Diff框架：1）柱感知交叉注意力机制，利用解剖对应区域在跨视图中倾向于位于相似列位置的几何特性；2）隐式3D结构重建模块，将噪声2D潜在特征反投影到基于乳腺视图投影几何的粗略3D特征体积中，增强解剖感知。

Result: 广泛实验表明，CA3D-Diff在双向任务中实现了卓越性能，在视觉保真度和结构一致性方面优于现有最先进方法。合成的视图有效改善了筛查设置中的单视图恶性分类。

Conclusion: 该方法在真实世界诊断中具有实用价值，能够有效解决乳腺X光片视图转换中的结构不对齐问题，并提升下游诊断任务的性能。

Abstract: Dual-view mammography, including craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique
(MLO) projections, offers complementary anatomical views crucial for breast
cancer diagnosis. However, in real-world clinical workflows, one view may be
missing, corrupted, or degraded due to acquisition errors or compression
artifacts, limiting the effectiveness of downstream analysis. View-to-view
translation can help recover missing views and improve lesion alignment. Unlike
natural images, this task in mammography is highly challenging due to large
non-rigid deformations and severe tissue overlap in X-ray projections, which
obscure pixel-level correspondences. In this paper, we propose Column-Aware and
Implicit 3D Diffusion (CA3D-Diff), a novel bidirectional mammogram view
translation framework based on conditional diffusion model. To address
cross-view structural misalignment, we first design a column-aware
cross-attention mechanism that leverages the geometric property that
anatomically corresponding regions tend to lie in similar column positions
across views. A Gaussian-decayed bias is applied to emphasize local column-wise
correlations while suppressing distant mismatches. Furthermore, we introduce an
implicit 3D structure reconstruction module that back-projects noisy 2D latents
into a coarse 3D feature volume based on breast-view projection geometry. The
reconstructed 3D structure is refined and injected into the denoising UNet to
guide cross-view generation with enhanced anatomical awareness. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that CA3D-Diff achieves superior performance in
bidirectional tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in visual fidelity
and structural consistency. Furthermore, the synthesized views effectively
improve single-view malignancy classification in screening settings,
demonstrating the practical value of our method in real-world diagnostics.

TL;DR: SSDD是一种新的像素扩散解码器架构，通过蒸馏技术实现单步重建，无需对抗性损失，在重建质量和采样速度上均优于传统的KL-VAE方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于KL-VAE的分词器需要对抗性损失，而扩散解码器虽然更理论化但需要迭代采样导致解码时间较长。为了解决这些限制，需要开发一种无需对抗性损失且能高效单步重建的扩散解码器。

Method: 提出新的像素扩散解码器架构，利用transformer组件和无GAN训练提高扩展性和训练稳定性。通过蒸馏技术将扩散解码器的性能复制到高效的单步解码器中。

Result: SSDD将重建FID从0.87提升到0.50，吞吐量提高1.4倍，同时保持DiTs的生成质量，采样速度提高3.8倍。

Conclusion: SSDD可以作为KL-VAE的直接替代品，用于构建更高质量和更快的生成模型。

Abstract: Tokenizers are a key component of state-of-the-art generative image models,
extracting the most important features from the signal while reducing data
dimension and redundancy. Most current tokenizers are based on KL-regularized
variational autoencoders (KL-VAE), trained with reconstruction, perceptual and
adversarial losses. Diffusion decoders have been proposed as a more principled
alternative to model the distribution over images conditioned on the latent.
However, matching the performance of KL-VAE still requires adversarial losses,
as well as a higher decoding time due to iterative sampling. To address these
limitations, we introduce a new pixel diffusion decoder architecture for
improved scaling and training stability, benefiting from transformer components
and GAN-free training. We use distillation to replicate the performance of the
diffusion decoder in an efficient single-step decoder. This makes SSDD the
first diffusion decoder optimized for single-step reconstruction trained
without adversarial losses, reaching higher reconstruction quality and faster
sampling than KL-VAE. In particular, SSDD improves reconstruction FID from
$0.87$ to $0.50$ with $1.4\times$ higher throughput and preserve generation
quality of DiTs with $3.8\times$ faster sampling. As such, SSDD can be used as
a drop-in replacement for KL-VAE, and for building higher-quality and faster
generative models.

Conclusion: 该方法为视觉基础模型提供了有效的所有权验证解决方案，即使在模型被下游任务微调后，嵌入的水印仍然保持可检测性。

Abstract: Being trained on large and vast datasets, visual foundation models (VFMs) can
be fine-tuned for diverse downstream tasks, achieving remarkable performance
and efficiency in various computer vision applications. The high computation
cost of data collection and training motivates the owners of some VFMs to
distribute them alongside the license to protect their intellectual property
rights. However, a dishonest user of the protected model's copy may illegally
redistribute it, for example, to make a profit. As a consequence, the
development of reliable ownership verification tools is of great importance
today, since such methods can be used to differentiate between a redistributed
copy of the protected model and an independent model. In this paper, we propose
an approach to ownership verification of visual foundation models by
fine-tuning a small set of expressive layers of a VFM along with a small
encoder-decoder network to embed digital watermarks into an internal
representation of a hold-out set of input images. Importantly, the watermarks
embedded remain detectable in the functional copies of the protected model,
obtained, for example, by fine-tuning the VFM for a particular downstream task.
Theoretically and experimentally, we demonstrate that the proposed method
yields a low probability of false detection of a non-watermarked model and a
low probability of false misdetection of a watermarked model.

Result: LUR和RLUR在分布内分类性能与其他方法相当，在不确定性分布外检测方面LUR与最佳方法相当，但训练更高效、调参更简单。

Conclusion: LUR方法在保持性能的同时显著降低了训练复杂度和调参难度，为安全关键应用提供了实用的不确定性估计解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly applied to safety-critical tasks
in resource-constrained environments, such as video-based driver action and
intention recognition. While last layer probabilistic deep learning (LL-PDL)
methods can detect out-of-distribution (OOD) instances, their performance
varies. As an alternative to last layer approaches, we propose extending
pre-trained DNNs with transformation layers to produce multiple latent
representations to estimate the uncertainty. We evaluate our latent uncertainty
representation (LUR) and repulsively trained LUR (RLUR) approaches against
eight PDL methods across four video-based driver action and intention
recognition datasets, comparing classification performance, calibration, and
uncertainty-based OOD detection. We also contribute 28,000 frame-level action
labels and 1,194 video-level intention labels for the NuScenes dataset. Our
results show that LUR and RLUR achieve comparable in-distribution
classification performance to other LL-PDL approaches. For uncertainty-based
OOD detection, LUR matches top-performing PDL methods while being more
efficient to train and easier to tune than approaches that require Markov-Chain
Monte Carlo sampling or repulsive training procedures.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition
characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons, leading to various movement
disorder symptoms. Early diagnosis of PD is crucial to prevent adverse effects,
yet traditional diagnostic methods are often cumbersome and costly. In this
study, a machine learning-based approach is proposed using hand-drawn spiral
and wave images as potential biomarkers for PD detection. Our methodology
leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transfer learning, and
attention mechanisms to improve model performance and resilience against
overfitting. To enhance the diversity and richness of both spiral and wave
categories, the training dataset undergoes augmentation to increase the number
of images. The proposed architecture comprises three phases: utilizing
pre-trained CNNs, incorporating custom convolutional layers, and ensemble
voting. Employing hard voting further enhances performance by aggregating
predictions from multiple models. Experimental results show promising accuracy
rates. For spiral images, weighted average precision, recall, and F1-score are
90%, and for wave images, they are 96.67%. After combining the predictions
through ensemble hard voting, the overall accuracy is 93.3%. These findings
underscore the potential of machine learning in early PD diagnosis, offering a
non-invasive and cost-effective solution to improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: Video understanding represents the most challenging frontier in computer
vision, requiring models to reason about complex spatiotemporal relationships,
long-term dependencies, and multimodal evidence. The recent emergence of
Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders
with powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that
transforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated
reasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature.
This survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training
methodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars:
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL)
from verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced
inference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the
roles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques,
addressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal
grounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration. Through
systematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design
principles, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open
challenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization. We
further curate essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to facilitate
rigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness. This survey aims to provide
researchers and practitioners with a unified framework for advancing Video-LMM
capabilities. Additional resources and updates are maintained at:

Abstract: Segment matching is an important intermediate task in computer vision that
establishes correspondences between semantically or geometrically coherent
regions across images. Unlike keypoint matching, which focuses on localized
features, segment matching captures structured regions, offering greater
robustness to occlusions, lighting variations, and viewpoint changes. In this
paper, we leverage the spatial understanding of 3D foundation models to tackle
wide-baseline segment matching, a challenging setting involving extreme
viewpoint shifts. We propose an architecture that uses the inductive bias of
these 3D foundation models to match segments across image pairs with up to 180
degree view-point change. Extensive experiments show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including the SAM2 video propagator and
local feature matching methods, by upto 30% on the AUPRC metric, on ScanNet++
and Replica datasets. We further demonstrate benefits of the proposed model on
relevant downstream tasks, including 3D instance segmentation and image-goal
navigation. Project Page: https://segmast3r.github.io/

### [164] [No-reference Quality Assessment of Contrast-distorted Images using Contrast-enhanced Pseudo Reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05053)
*Mohammad-Ali Mahmoudpour,Saeed Mahmoudpour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对对比度失真图像的无参考图像质量评估方法，通过选择最合适的对比度增强算法生成伪参考图像，将NR-IQA问题转化为FR-IQA问题以提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比度变化是影响图像质量的重要因素，但在图像质量评估中常被忽视，因为其视觉影响和特性与其他传统失真类型不同。现有方法主要关注模糊和噪声等失真，缺乏专门针对对比度失真的有效评估方法。

Method: 使用一组对比度增强算法生成视觉上接近实际参考图像的伪参考图像，通过训练分类网络基于图像内容和失真选择最合适的对比度增强算法，然后在FR模式下评估对比度增强图像与退化图像之间的质量差异。

Result: 在包含对比度失真的三个数据库（CCID2014、TID2013和CSIQ）上的性能评估表明，该方法具有有前景的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将无参考图像质量评估问题转化为全参考评估问题，通过伪参考图像生成策略有效解决了对比度失真图像的质量评估问题。

Abstract: Contrast change is an important factor that affects the quality of images.
During image capturing, unfavorable lighting conditions can cause contrast
change and visual quality loss. While various methods have been proposed to
assess the quality of images under different distortions such as blur and
noise, contrast distortion has been largely overlooked as its visual impact and
properties are different from other conventional types of distortions. In this
paper, we propose a no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) metric for
contrast-distorted images. Using a set of contrast enhancement algorithms, we
aim to generate pseudo-reference images that are visually close to the actual
reference image, such that the NR problem is transformed to a Full-reference
(FR) assessment with higher accuracy. To this end, a large dataset of
contrast-enhanced images is produced to train a classification network that can
select the most suitable contrast enhancement algorithm based on image content
and distortion for pseudo-reference image generation. Finally, the evaluation
is performed in the FR manner to assess the quality difference between the
contrast-enhanced (pseudoreference) and degraded images. Performance evaluation
of the proposed method on three databases containing contrast distortions
(CCID2014, TID2013, and CSIQ), indicates the promising performance of the
proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要高效准确的废物分类和工业表面缺陷检测，以支持可持续废物管理和高质量控制标准。

Method: 结合ResNet-50进行局部特征提取，Vision Transformer捕获全局语义上下文，集成FAISS相似性检索，采用神经可塑性模块化设计，包含可扩展学习块，在训练性能停滞时动态增长。

Result: 在废物分类和KolektorSDD2工业缺陷检测数据集上，该架构在准确性和适应性方面优于传统静态模型。

Conclusion: Neuroplastic Modular Classifier为现实世界图像分类提供了可扩展的高性能解决方案，在环境和工业领域具有强适用性。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate classification of waste and industrial surface defects
is essential for ensuring sustainable waste management and maintaining high
standards in quality control. This paper introduces the Neuroplastic Modular
Classifier, a novel hybrid architecture designed for robust and adaptive image
classification in dynamic environments. The model combines a ResNet-50 backbone
for localized feature extraction with a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture
global semantic context. Additionally, FAISS-based similarity retrieval is
incorporated to provide a memory-like reference to previously encountered data,
enriching the model's feature space. A key innovation of our architecture is
the neuroplastic modular design composed of expandable, learnable blocks that
dynamically grow during training when performance plateaus. Inspired by
biological learning systems, this mechanism allows the model to adapt to data
complexity over time, improving generalization. Beyond garbage classification,
we validate the model on the Kolektor Surface Defect Dataset 2 (KolektorSDD2),
which involves industrial defect detection on metal surfaces. Experimental
results across domains show that the proposed architecture outperforms
traditional static models in both accuracy and adaptability. The Neuroplastic
Modular Classifier offers a scalable, high-performance solution for real-world
image classification, with strong applicability in both environmental and
industrial domains.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个针对结构化视觉内容（如图表、图表、数学图形）生成和编辑的综合解决方案，包括大规模数据集构建、统一模型训练和评估基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉生成模型在生成美观的自然图像方面表现出色，但在处理需要组合规划、文本渲染和多模态推理的结构化视觉内容时表现不佳。

Method: 构建了130万高质量结构化图像对的数据集，训练了一个集成VLM和FLUX.1 Kontext的统一模型，采用三阶段训练课程，并在推理时使用外部推理器增强性能。

Result: 评估了15个模型，发现即使是领先的闭源系统也远未达到满意水平。提出的模型在编辑任务上表现强劲，推理时推理在不同架构中带来一致增益。

Conclusion: 通过发布数据集、模型和基准测试，旨在推进结构化视觉内容的统一多模态基础研究。

Abstract: While modern visual generation models excel at creating aesthetically
pleasing natural images, they struggle with producing or editing structured
visuals like charts, diagrams, and mathematical figures, which demand
composition planning, text rendering, and multimodal reasoning for factual
fidelity. To address this, we present the first comprehensive, systematic
investigation of this domain, encompassing data construction, model training,
and an evaluation benchmark. First, we construct a large-scale dataset of 1.3
million high-quality structured image pairs derived from executable drawing
programs and augmented with chain-of-thought reasoning annotations. Building on
it, we train a unified model that integrates a VLM with FLUX.1 Kontext via a
lightweight connector for enhanced multimodal understanding. A three-stage
training curriculum enables progressive feature alignment, knowledge infusion,
and reasoning-augmented generation, further boosted by an external reasoner at
inference time. Finally, we introduce StructBench, a novel benchmark for
generation and editing with over 1,700 challenging instances, and an
accompanying evaluation metric, StructScore, which employs a multi-round Q\&A
protocol to assess fine-grained factual accuracy. Evaluations of 15 models
reveal that even leading closed-source systems remain far from satisfactory.
Our model attains strong editing performance, and inference-time reasoning
yields consistent gains across diverse architectures. By releasing the dataset,
model, and benchmark, we aim to advance unified multimodal foundations for
structured visuals.

TL;DR: 提出了一个跨角色交互的视频生成框架，通过交叉角色嵌入和增强技术，解决不同世界角色自然交互时的身份保持和风格一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何生成不同世界角色（如Mr. Bean和Tom and Jerry）自然交互的视频，关键挑战在于保持角色身份和行为逻辑的同时避免风格失真。

Method: 采用交叉角色嵌入（CCE）学习跨模态源的身份和行为逻辑，以及交叉角色增强（CCA）通过合成共存和混合风格数据丰富训练。

Result: 在包含10个角色的卡通和真人剧集基准测试中，在身份保持、交互质量和风格失真鲁棒性方面均有明显改进。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现先前不共存角色间的自然交互而不失风格保真度，为生成式故事叙述开辟了新形式。

Abstract: Imagine Mr. Bean stepping into Tom and Jerry--can we generate videos where
characters interact naturally across different worlds? We study inter-character
interaction in text-to-video generation, where the key challenge is to preserve
each character's identity and behaviors while enabling coherent cross-context
interaction. This is difficult because characters may never have coexisted and
because mixing styles often causes style delusion, where realistic characters
appear cartoonish or vice versa. We introduce a framework that tackles these
issues with Cross-Character Embedding (CCE), which learns identity and
behavioral logic across multimodal sources, and Cross-Character Augmentation
(CCA), which enriches training with synthetic co-existence and mixed-style
data. Together, these techniques allow natural interactions between previously
uncoexistent characters without losing stylistic fidelity. Experiments on a
curated benchmark of cartoons and live-action series with 10 characters show
clear improvements in identity preservation, interaction quality, and
robustness to style delusion, enabling new forms of generative
storytelling.Additional results and videos are available on our project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VChain是一个推理时视觉思维链框架，通过多模态模型生成关键帧来指导视频生成，提升复杂动态场景的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型难以合成具有连贯因果链的复杂动态，而多模态模型具备强大的视觉状态推理和未来预测能力，需要将两者优势结合。

Method: 利用大型多模态模型生成稀疏关键帧作为快照，然后仅在这些关键时刻对预训练视频生成器进行稀疏推理时调优。

Result: 在复杂的多步骤场景实验中，VChain显著提升了生成视频的质量。

Conclusion: VChain提供了一种调优高效、开销最小的视频生成方法，通过注入视觉推理信号有效解决了复杂动态建模的挑战。

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce smooth and visually appealing
clips, but they often struggle to synthesize complex dynamics with a coherent
chain of consequences. Accurately modeling visual outcomes and state
transitions over time remains a core challenge. In contrast, large language and
multimodal models (e.g., GPT-4o) exhibit strong visual state reasoning and
future prediction capabilities. To bridge these strengths, we introduce VChain,
a novel inference-time chain-of-visual-thought framework that injects visual
reasoning signals from multimodal models into video generation. Specifically,
VChain contains a dedicated pipeline that leverages large multimodal models to
generate a sparse set of critical keyframes as snapshots, which are then used
to guide the sparse inference-time tuning of a pre-trained video generator only
at these key moments. Our approach is tuning-efficient, introduces minimal
overhead and avoids dense supervision. Extensive experiments on complex,
multi-step scenarios show that VChain significantly enhances the quality of
generated videos.

Abstract: Academic presentation videos have become an essential medium for research
communication, yet producing them remains highly labor-intensive, often
requiring hours of slide design, recording, and editing for a short 2 to 10
minutes video. Unlike natural video, presentation video generation involves
distinctive challenges: inputs from research papers, dense multi-modal
information (text, figures, tables), and the need to coordinate multiple
aligned channels such as slides, subtitles, speech, and human talker. To
address these challenges, we introduce PaperTalker, the first benchmark of 101
research papers paired with author-created presentation videos, slides, and
speaker metadata. We further design four tailored evaluation metrics--Meta
Similarity, PresentArena, PresentQuiz, and IP Memory--to measure how videos
convey the paper's information to the audience. Building on this foundation, we
propose PaperTalker, the first multi-agent framework for academic presentation
video generation. It integrates slide generation with effective layout
refinement by a novel effective tree search visual choice, cursor grounding,
subtitling, speech synthesis, and talking-head rendering, while parallelizing
slide-wise generation for efficiency. Experiments on Paper2Video demonstrate
that the presentation videos produced by our approach are more faithful and
informative than existing baselines, establishing a practical step toward
automated and ready-to-use academic video generation. Our dataset, agent, and
code are available at https://github.com/showlab/Paper2Video.
