### [1] [Exploring the Capabilities of LLM Encoders for Image-Text Retrieval in Chest X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15234)
*Hanbin Ko,Gihun Cho,Inhyeok Baek,Donguk Kim,Joonbeom Koo,Changi Kim,Dongheon Lee,Chang Min Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出LLM2VEC4CXR和LLM2CLIP4CXR模型，通过使用大语言模型编码器来提升胸部X光报告的临床文本理解能力，解决放射学报告中异质性和噪声问题，强调鲁棒性而非单纯数据规模的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学报告存在缩写、仅含印象和风格变异等异质性问题，单纯扩大噪声报告数据规模会导致模型性能停滞甚至下降，需要更鲁棒的临床表示方法。

Method: 引入LLM2VEC4CXR（领域适应的大语言模型编码器）和LLM2CLIP4CXR（双塔框架），将LLM编码器与视觉骨干网络结合，在160万份胸部X光研究数据上进行训练。

Result: LLM2VEC4CXR在临床文本理解上优于BERT基线，能处理缩写和风格变异；LLM2CLIP4CXR提升了检索准确性和临床导向评分，具有更强的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: 鲁棒性而非单纯的数据规模是实现有效多模态学习的关键，模型已发布以支持医学图像-文本表示学习的进一步研究。

Abstract: Vision-language pretraining has advanced image-text alignment, yet progress
in radiology remains constrained by the heterogeneity of clinical reports,
including abbreviations, impression-only notes, and stylistic variability.
Unlike general-domain settings where more data often leads to better
performance, naively scaling to large collections of noisy reports can plateau
or even degrade model learning. We ask whether large language model (LLM)
encoders can provide robust clinical representations that transfer across
diverse styles and better guide image-text alignment. We introduce LLM2VEC4CXR,
a domain-adapted LLM encoder for chest X-ray reports, and LLM2CLIP4CXR, a
dual-tower framework that couples this encoder with a vision backbone.
LLM2VEC4CXR improves clinical text understanding over BERT-based baselines,
handles abbreviations and style variation, and achieves strong clinical
alignment on report-level metrics. LLM2CLIP4CXR leverages these embeddings to
boost retrieval accuracy and clinically oriented scores, with stronger
cross-dataset generalization than prior medical CLIP variants. Trained on 1.6M
CXR studies from public and private sources with heterogeneous and noisy
reports, our models demonstrate that robustness -- not scale alone -- is the
key to effective multimodal learning. We release models to support further
research in medical image-text representation learning.

### [2] [ViSpec: Accelerating Vision-Language Models with Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15235)
*Jialiang Kang,Han Shu,Wenshuo Li,Yingjie Zhai,Xinghao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViSpec是一种针对视觉语言模型(VLMs)的推测解码框架，通过轻量级视觉适配器压缩图像标记并保持位置信息，结合全局特征增强多模态一致性，实现了VLM推测解码的显著加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码技术在视觉语言模型中的应用不足，只能获得有限的加速效果(<1.5倍)。随着多模态能力在大规模模型中的重要性日益凸显，这一差距变得尤为显著。

Method: 提出ViSpec框架：1)使用轻量级视觉适配器压缩图像标记；2)提取全局特征向量增强文本标记；3)通过重新利用现有数据集和修改提示生成扩展输出来构建训练数据；4)采用避免捷径学习的训练策略。

Result: 实验验证ViSpec实现了视觉语言模型推测解码的首次显著加速，突破了现有方法的性能瓶颈。

Conclusion: ViSpec成功解决了VLM推测解码的挑战，证明了大型VLM能够有效过滤冗余图像信息而不影响文本理解能力，为多模态模型的高效推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a widely adopted technique for accelerating inference
in large language models (LLMs), yet its application to vision-language models
(VLMs) remains underexplored, with existing methods achieving only modest
speedups (<1.5x). This gap is increasingly significant as multimodal
capabilities become central to large-scale models. We hypothesize that large
VLMs can effectively filter redundant image information layer by layer without
compromising textual comprehension, whereas smaller draft models struggle to do
so. To address this, we introduce Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding (ViSpec), a
novel framework tailored for VLMs. ViSpec employs a lightweight vision adaptor
module to compress image tokens into a compact representation, which is
seamlessly integrated into the draft model's attention mechanism while
preserving original image positional information. Additionally, we extract a
global feature vector for each input image and augment all subsequent text
tokens with this feature to enhance multimodal coherence. To overcome the
scarcity of multimodal datasets with long assistant responses, we curate a
specialized training dataset by repurposing existing datasets and generating
extended outputs using the target VLM with modified prompts. Our training
strategy mitigates the risk of the draft model exploiting direct access to the
target model's hidden states, which could otherwise lead to shortcut learning
when training solely on target model outputs. Extensive experiments validate
ViSpec, achieving, to our knowledge, the first substantial speedup in VLM
speculative decoding.

### [3] [M-PACE: Mother Child Framework for Multimodal Compliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15241)
*Shreyash Verma,Amit Kesari,Vinayak Trivedi,Anupam Purwar,Ratnesh Jamidar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了M-PACE框架，利用多模态大语言模型统一处理视觉和文本内容的合规性检查，显著降低人工审核依赖和推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统合规框架采用分散的多阶段流程，存在操作复杂、可扩展性差、难以适应动态指南的问题，需要统一的多模态合规解决方案。

Method: 采用母-子MLLM架构，强母模型评估小子模型的输出，在广告合规场景中评估15+个合规属性，并构建包含挑战性样本的基准数据集。

Result: 推理成本降低31倍以上，最有效模型每张图像成本0.0005美元，相比Gemini 2.5 Pro的0.0159美元，在保持可比准确性的同时实现实时部署。

Conclusion: M-PACE框架证明了MLLM在统一多模态合规检查中的有效性，能够在成本和质量之间取得良好平衡，为自动化质量控制提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Ensuring that multi-modal content adheres to brand, legal, or
platform-specific compliance standards is an increasingly complex challenge
across domains. Traditional compliance frameworks typically rely on disjointed,
multi-stage pipelines that integrate separate modules for image classification,
text extraction, audio transcription, hand-crafted checks, and rule-based
merges. This architectural fragmentation increases operational overhead,
hampers scalability, and hinders the ability to adapt to dynamic guidelines
efficiently. With the emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
there is growing potential to unify these workflows under a single,
general-purpose framework capable of jointly processing visual and textual
content. In light of this, we propose Multimodal Parameter Agnostic Compliance
Engine (M-PACE), a framework designed for assessing attributes across
vision-language inputs in a single pass. As a representative use case, we apply
M-PACE to advertisement compliance, demonstrating its ability to evaluate over
15 compliance-related attributes. To support structured evaluation, we
introduce a human-annotated benchmark enriched with augmented samples that
simulate challenging real-world conditions, including visual obstructions and
profanity injection. M-PACE employs a mother-child MLLM setup, demonstrating
that a stronger parent MLLM evaluating the outputs of smaller child models can
significantly reduce dependence on human reviewers, thereby automating quality
control. Our analysis reveals that inference costs reduce by over 31 times,
with the most efficient models (Gemini 2.0 Flash as child MLLM selected by
mother MLLM) operating at 0.0005 per image, compared to 0.0159 for Gemini 2.5
Pro with comparable accuracy, highlighting the trade-off between cost and
output quality achieved in real time by M-PACE in real life deployment over
advertising data.

### [4] [ProFusion: 3D Reconstruction of Protein Complex Structures from Multi-view AFM Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15242)
*Jaydeep Rade,Md Hasibul Hasan Hasib,Meric Ozturk,Baboucarr Faal,Sheng Yang,Dipali G. Sashital,Vincenzo Venditti,Baoyu Chen,Soumik Sarkar,Adarsh Krishnamurthy,Anwesha Sarkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProFusion是一个结合深度学习和原子力显微镜的混合框架，通过虚拟AFM生成多视角合成图像，使用条件扩散模型和NeRF进行3D蛋白质结构重建，实现高精度且成本效益高的蛋白质复合物结构预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI方法在预测大型蛋白质复合物结构时因缺乏3D空间线索而困难，实验方法如Cryo-EM准确但成本高且耗时。需要开发一种结合计算和实验优势的解决方案。

Method: 开发虚拟AFM框架生成542,000个蛋白质的多视角合成图像数据集；训练条件扩散模型从无姿态输入合成新视角；使用实例特定NeRF模型重建3D结构。

Result: 重建的3D蛋白质结构平均Chamfer距离在AFM成像分辨率内，具有高结构保真度；在多种蛋白质复合物的实验AFM图像上得到广泛验证。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在准确、成本效益高的蛋白质复合物结构预测和通过AFM实验进行快速迭代验证方面的强大潜力。

Abstract: AI-based in silico methods have improved protein structure prediction but
often struggle with large protein complexes (PCs) involving multiple
interacting proteins due to missing 3D spatial cues. Experimental techniques
like Cryo-EM are accurate but costly and time-consuming. We present ProFusion,
a hybrid framework that integrates a deep learning model with Atomic Force
Microscopy (AFM), which provides high-resolution height maps from random
orientations, naturally yielding multi-view data for 3D reconstruction.
However, generating a large-scale AFM imaging data set sufficient to train deep
learning models is impractical. Therefore, we developed a virtual AFM framework
that simulates the imaging process and generated a dataset of ~542,000 proteins
with multi-view synthetic AFM images. We train a conditional diffusion model to
synthesize novel views from unposed inputs and an instance-specific Neural
Radiance Field (NeRF) model to reconstruct 3D structures. Our reconstructed 3D
protein structures achieve an average Chamfer Distance within the AFM imaging
resolution, reflecting high structural fidelity. Our method is extensively
validated on experimental AFM images of various PCs, demonstrating strong
potential for accurate, cost-effective protein complex structure prediction and
rapid iterative validation using AFM experiments.

### [5] [Multi-Modal Interpretability for Enhanced Localization in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15243)
*Muhammad Imran,Yugyung Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了多模态可解释学习框架MMEL，通过分层语义关系模块增强视觉语言模型的可解释性，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键场景中应用视觉语言模型面临挑战，需要提高模型的透明度和可靠性，以处理复杂对象关系和细微视觉线索。

Method: 基于Grad-eclip的梯度解释方法，引入分层语义关系模块，通过多尺度特征处理、自适应注意力加权和跨模态对齐来增强模型可解释性。

Result: 在标准数据集上的实验表明，MMEL能够产生更聚焦和上下文感知的可视化结果，更好地反映视觉语言模型处理复杂场景的方式。

Conclusion: MMEL框架具有良好的泛化能力，为需要高可解释性和可靠性的应用提供了有价值的模型决策洞察。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have significantly expanded the
frontiers of automated image analysis. However, applying these models in
safety-critical contexts remains challenging due to the complex relationships
between objects, subtle visual cues, and the heightened demand for transparency
and reliability. This paper presents the Multi-Modal Explainable Learning
(MMEL) framework, designed to enhance the interpretability of vision-language
models while maintaining high performance. Building upon prior work in
gradient-based explanations for transformer architectures (Grad-eclip), MMEL
introduces a novel Hierarchical Semantic Relationship Module that enhances
model interpretability through multi-scale feature processing, adaptive
attention weighting, and cross-modal alignment. Our approach processes features
at multiple semantic levels to capture relationships between image regions at
different granularities, applying learnable layer-specific weights to balance
contributions across the model's depth. This results in more comprehensive
visual explanations that highlight both primary objects and their contextual
relationships with improved precision. Through extensive experiments on
standard datasets, we demonstrate that by incorporating semantic relationship
information into gradient-based attribution maps, MMEL produces more focused
and contextually aware visualizations that better reflect how vision-language
models process complex scenes. The MMEL framework generalizes across various
domains, offering valuable insights into model decisions for applications
requiring high interpretability and reliability.

### [6] [Walk and Read Less: Improving the Efficiency of Vision-and-Language Navigation via Tuning-Free Multimodal Token Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15250)
*Wenda Qin,Andrea Burns,Bryan A. Plummer,Margrit Betke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了导航感知剪枝（NAP）方法，针对视觉语言导航任务中的效率问题，通过导航特定特征预过滤令牌，在保持高成功率的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型模型在视觉语言导航任务中表现优异但计算成本高，现有剪枝方法未能解决VLN特有的挑战，如信息丢失导致导航路径变长反而增加计算成本。

Method: 使用导航特定特征将令牌预过滤为前景和背景，基于导航方向过滤图像视图，利用大语言模型提取导航相关指令，主要对背景令牌进行剪枝，并移除低重要性导航节点避免回溯。

Result: 在标准VLN基准测试中，NAP显著优于现有方法，在保持更高成功率的同时节省超过50%的FLOPS。

Conclusion: NAP方法通过导航感知的令牌过滤策略，有效解决了VLN任务中剪枝带来的效率与性能平衡问题，为资源受限环境下的高效导航提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large models achieve strong performance on Vision-and-Language Navigation
(VLN) tasks, but are costly to run in resource-limited environments. Token
pruning offers appealing tradeoffs for efficiency with minimal performance loss
by reducing model input size, but prior work overlooks VLN-specific challenges.
For example, information loss from pruning can effectively increase
computational cost due to longer walks. Thus, the inability to identify
uninformative tokens undermines the supposed efficiency gains from pruning. To
address this, we propose Navigation-Aware Pruning (NAP), which uses
navigation-specific traits to simplify the pruning process by pre-filtering
tokens into foreground and background. For example, image views are filtered
based on whether the agent can navigate in that direction. We also extract
navigation-relevant instructions using a Large Language Model. After filtering,
we focus pruning on background tokens, minimizing information loss. To further
help avoid increases in navigation length, we discourage backtracking by
removing low-importance navigation nodes. Experiments on standard VLN
benchmarks show NAP significantly outperforms prior work, preserving higher
success rates while saving more than 50% FLOPS.

### [7] [RespoDiff: Dual-Module Bottleneck Transformation for Responsible & Faithful T2I Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15257)
*Silpa Vadakkeeveetil Sreelatha,Sauradip Nag,Muhammad Awais,Serge Belongie,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RespoDiff是一个新颖的负责任文本到图像生成框架，通过在扩散模型的中间瓶颈表示上引入双模块转换，同时确保公平性、安全性和语义保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在文本到图像生成方面取得了显著进展，但确保公平性和安全性仍然是一个挑战。现有方法通常在提高公平性和安全性时会牺牲语义保真度和图像质量。

Method: 提出RespoDiff框架，包含两个可学习模块：一个专注于捕获和执行负责任概念（如公平性和安全性），另一个致力于保持与中性提示的语义对齐。采用新颖的分数匹配目标来实现模块间的有效协调。

Result: 该方法在负责任生成方面优于现有最先进方法，确保语义对齐的同时优化两个目标而不损害图像保真度。在多样未见提示上的负责任和语义一致性生成提高了20%，并能无缝集成到SDXL等大规模模型中。

Conclusion: RespoDiff通过双模块转换方法有效解决了文本到图像生成中的公平性和安全性问题，同时保持了高质量的语义对齐和图像保真度。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models has enabled high-fidelity and
semantically rich text-to-image generation; however, ensuring fairness and
safety remains an open challenge. Existing methods typically improve fairness
and safety at the expense of semantic fidelity and image quality. In this work,
we propose RespoDiff, a novel framework for responsible text-to-image
generation that incorporates a dual-module transformation on the intermediate
bottleneck representations of diffusion models. Our approach introduces two
distinct learnable modules: one focused on capturing and enforcing responsible
concepts, such as fairness and safety, and the other dedicated to maintaining
semantic alignment with neutral prompts. To facilitate the dual learning
process, we introduce a novel score-matching objective that enables effective
coordination between the modules. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in responsible generation by ensuring semantic alignment while
optimizing both objectives without compromising image fidelity. Our approach
improves responsible and semantically coherent generation by 20% across
diverse, unseen prompts. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into large-scale
models like SDXL, enhancing fairness and safety. Code will be released upon
acceptance.

### [8] [Autoguided Online Data Curation for Diffusion Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15267)
*Valeria Pais,Luis Oala,Daniele Faccio,Marco Aversa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了自动引导和在线数据选择方法在生成扩散模型训练中的效率提升效果，发现自动引导能持续改善样本质量和多样性，而早期数据选择虽能提高数据效率但时间开销较大


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型计算成本高昂，重新激发了高效数据管理的需求，研究旨在探索最新开发的自动引导和在线数据选择方法是否能改善扩散模型的训练时间和样本效率

Method: 将联合示例选择（JEST）和自动引导整合到统一代码库中，在2D合成数据生成和3x64x64图像生成任务上进行对比实验，考虑选择开销的时间公平比较

Result: 自动引导在所有实验中持续改善样本质量和多样性；早期AJEST在数据效率上能匹配或略微超过单独使用自动引导，但其时间开销和复杂性使得自动引导或均匀随机数据选择在多数情况下更优

Conclusion: 虽然有针对性的在线选择在早期训练中能带来效率增益，但稳健的样本质量改进主要由自动引导驱动，数据选择仅在特定情况下有益

Abstract: The costs of generative model compute rekindled promises and hopes for
efficient data curation. In this work, we investigate whether recently
developed autoguidance and online data selection methods can improve the time
and sample efficiency of training generative diffusion models. We integrate
joint example selection (JEST) and autoguidance into a unified code base for
fast ablation and benchmarking. We evaluate combinations of data curation on a
controlled 2-D synthetic data generation task as well as (3x64x64)-D image
generation. Our comparisons are made at equal wall-clock time and equal number
of samples, explicitly accounting for the overhead of selection. Across
experiments, autoguidance consistently improves sample quality and diversity.
Early AJEST (applying selection only at the beginning of training) can match or
modestly exceed autoguidance alone in data efficiency on both tasks. However,
its time overhead and added complexity make autoguidance or uniform random data
selection preferable in most situations. These findings suggest that while
targeted online selection can yield efficiency gains in early training, robust
sample quality improvements are primarily driven by autoguidance. We discuss
limitations and scope, and outline when data selection may be beneficial.

### [9] [PRISM: Phase-enhanced Radial-based Image Signature Mapping framework for fingerprinting AI-generated images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15270)
*Emanuele Ricco,Elia Onofri,Lorenzo Cima,Stefano Cresci,Roberto Di Pietro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM是一个基于傅里叶变换相位增强的径向图像签名映射框架，用于指纹识别AI生成图像，实现模型溯源，在PRISM-36K数据集上达到92.04%的溯源准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业环境中用户需要保证AI生成内容的来源可追溯性，特别是在付费专有服务中，需要可靠的模型溯源方法。

Method: 采用基于离散傅里叶变换的径向降维方法，利用振幅和相位信息捕获模型特定签名，通过线性判别分析进行聚类实现模型溯源。

Result: 在PRISM-36K数据集上达到92.04%的溯源准确率，在四个基准测试中平均准确率为81.60%，在真假图像检测任务中平均准确率为88.41%。

Conclusion: 频域指纹识别方法在跨架构和跨数据集的模型溯源中表现有效，为生成式AI系统的问责和信任提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: A critical need has emerged for generative AI: attribution methods. That is,
solutions that can identify the model originating AI-generated content. This
feature, generally relevant in multimodal applications, is especially sensitive
in commercial settings where users subscribe to paid proprietary services and
expect guarantees about the source of the content they receive. To address
these issues, we introduce PRISM, a scalable Phase-enhanced Radial-based Image
Signature Mapping framework for fingerprinting AI-generated images. PRISM is
based on a radial reduction of the discrete Fourier transform that leverages
amplitude and phase information to capture model-specific signatures. The
output of the above process is subsequently clustered via linear discriminant
analysis to achieve reliable model attribution in diverse settings, even if the
model's internal details are inaccessible. To support our work, we construct
PRISM-36K, a novel dataset of 36,000 images generated by six text-to-image GAN-
and diffusion-based models. On this dataset, PRISM achieves an attribution
accuracy of 92.04%. We additionally evaluate our method on four benchmarks from
the literature, reaching an average accuracy of 81.60%. Finally, we evaluate
our methodology also in the binary task of detecting real vs fake images,
achieving an average accuracy of 88.41%. We obtain our best result on GenImage
with an accuracy of 95.06%, whereas the original benchmark achieved 82.20%. Our
results demonstrate the effectiveness of frequency-domain fingerprinting for
cross-architecture and cross-dataset model attribution, offering a viable
solution for enforcing accountability and trust in generative AI systems.

### [10] [Large Vision Models Can Solve Mental Rotation Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15271)
*Sebastian Ray Mason,Anders Gjølbye,Phillip Chavarria Højbjerg,Lenka Tětková,Lars Kai Hansen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了ViT、CLIP、DINOv2和DINOv3在心理旋转任务上的表现，发现自监督ViT比监督ViT更能捕捉几何结构，中间层表现优于最终层，任务难度随旋转复杂度和遮挡增加而增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现代视觉变换器取得了成功，但仍不清楚这些模型是否具备类似人类的空间推理能力，特别是心理旋转能力。

Method: 通过逐层探测模型表示，在从简单块结构到复杂块图形、三种文本类型和照片级真实物体的心理旋转任务上评估多种ViT模型。

Result: 自监督ViT在捕捉几何结构方面优于监督ViT；中间层表现比最终层更好；任务难度随旋转复杂度和遮挡增加而增加，与人类反应时间相似。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明视觉变换器在心理旋转任务上表现出与人类相似的约束模式，为理解深度学习模型的空间推理能力提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Mental rotation is a key test of spatial reasoning in humans and has been
central to understanding how perception supports cognition. Despite the success
of modern vision transformers, it is still unclear how well these models
develop similar abilities. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of
ViT, CLIP, DINOv2, and DINOv3 across a range of mental-rotation tasks, from
simple block structures similar to those used by Shepard and Metzler to study
human cognition, to more complex block figures, three types of text, and
photo-realistic objects. By probing model representations layer by layer, we
examine where and how these networks succeed. We find that i) self-supervised
ViTs capture geometric structure better than supervised ViTs; ii) intermediate
layers perform better than final layers; iii) task difficulty increases with
rotation complexity and occlusion, mirroring human reaction times and
suggesting similar constraints in embedding space representations.

### [11] [Which Direction to Choose? An Analysis on the Representation Power of Self-Supervised ViTs in Downstream Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15272)
*Yannis Kaltampanidis,Alexandros Doumanoglou,Dimitrios Zarpalas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了未经修改的ViT特征在图像分类和分割任务中的内在表示能力，填补了现有研究中对原始ViT特征分析不足的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督学习预训练的ViT特征通常需要额外处理层才能获得优越性能，但缺乏对未经修改特征内在能力的全面分析。

Method: 使用基于超平面（如逻辑回归）或余弦相似度的分类和分割规则，分析不同token类型、任务和预训练ViT模型，无需额外特征变换。

Result: 研究提供了基于任务、上下文和预训练目标的token类型和决策规则的最佳选择见解，并在两个广泛使用的数据集上报告详细结果。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了ViT特征内在表示能力分析的空白，为不同场景下的特征选择和决策规则提供了指导性见解。

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Vision Transformers (ViTs) has recently
demonstrated considerable potential as a pre-training strategy for a variety of
computer vision tasks, including image classification and segmentation, both in
standard and few-shot downstream contexts. Two pre-training objectives dominate
the landscape of SSL techniques: Contrastive Learning and Masked Image
Modeling. Features (or tokens) extracted from the final transformer attention
block -- specifically, the keys, queries, and values -- as well as features
obtained after the final block's feed-forward layer, have become a common
foundation for addressing downstream tasks. However, in many existing
approaches, these pre-trained ViT features are further processed through
additional transformation layers, often involving lightweight heads or combined
with distillation, to achieve superior task performance. Although such methods
can improve task outcomes, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive
analysis of the intrinsic representation capabilities of unaltered ViT features
has yet to be conducted. This study aims to bridge this gap by systematically
evaluating the use of these unmodified features across image classification and
segmentation tasks, in both standard and few-shot contexts. The classification
and segmentation rules that we use are either hyperplane based (as in logistic
regression) or cosine-similarity based, both of which rely on the presence of
interpretable directions in the ViT's latent space. Based on the previous rules
and without the use of additional feature transformations, we conduct an
analysis across token types, tasks, and pre-trained ViT models. This study
provides insights into the optimal choice for token type and decision rule
based on the task, context, and the pre-training objective, while reporting
detailed findings on two widely-used datasets.

Abstract: Embodied agents operating in the physical world must make decisions that are
not only effective but also safe, spatially coherent, and grounded in context.
While recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown promising
capabilities in visual understanding and language generation, their ability to
perform structured reasoning for real-world embodied tasks remains
underexplored. In this work, we aim to understand how well foundation models
can perform step-by-step reasoning in embodied environments. To this end, we
propose the Foundation Model Embodied Reasoning (FoMER) benchmark, designed to
evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LMMs in complex embodied decision-making
scenarios. Our benchmark spans a diverse set of tasks that require agents to
interpret multimodal observations, reason about physical constraints and
safety, and generate valid next actions in natural language. We present (i) a
large-scale, curated suite of embodied reasoning tasks, (ii) a novel evaluation
framework that disentangles perceptual grounding from action reasoning, and
(iii) empirical analysis of several leading LMMs under this setting. Our
benchmark includes over 1.1k samples with detailed step-by-step reasoning
across 10 tasks and 8 embodiments, covering three different robot types. Our
results highlight both the potential and current limitations of LMMs in
embodied reasoning, pointing towards key challenges and opportunities for
future research in robot intelligence. Our data and code will be made publicly
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于提示的CLIP方法存在的两个问题：1）不准确的文本描述导致精度和鲁棒性下降；2）有限的视觉语言嵌入对齐影响泛化性能。

Method: 提出条件域提示学习（CoDoL）方法，利用域信息构建提示，并设计轻量级域元网络（DMN）生成输入条件标记来捕获实例特定和域特定信息。

Conclusion: CoDoL方法通过条件域提示学习和域元网络有效解决了CLIP方法在分布外泛化中的关键问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-training vision-language models (VLMs), e.g.,
contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) methods, have shown great
potential in learning out-of-distribution (OOD) representations. Despite
showing competitive performance, the prompt-based CLIP methods still suffer
from: i) inaccurate text descriptions, which leads to degraded accuracy and
robustness, and poses a challenge for zero-shot CLIP methods. ii) limited
vision-language embedding alignment, which significantly affects the
generalization performance. To tackle the above issues, this paper proposes a
novel Conditional Domain prompt Learning (CoDoL) method, which utilizes
readily-available domain information to form prompts and improves the
vision-language embedding alignment for improving OOD generalization. To
capture both instance-specific and domain-specific information, we further
propose a lightweight Domain Meta Network (DMN) to generate input-conditional
tokens for images in each domain. Extensive experiments on four OOD benchmarks
(PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome and DigitDG) validate the effectiveness of our proposed
CoDoL in terms of improving the vision-language embedding alignment as well as
the out-of-distribution generalization performance.

TL;DR: AdaptiveNN是一个从被动视觉处理转向主动自适应视觉的框架，通过序列化注视机制实现高效视觉感知，在17个基准测试中达到28倍推理成本降低，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类视觉通过选择性注视高效处理复杂环境，而现有机器视觉模型被动处理整个场景，导致资源需求过高，限制了实际应用和未来发展。

Method: 将视觉感知建模为从粗到细的序列决策过程，结合表示学习和自奖励强化学习，无需注视位置监督即可端到端训练非可微分的AdaptiveNN。

Result: 在9个任务的17个基准测试中，AdaptiveNN实现高达28倍的推理成本降低，灵活适应不同任务需求和资源预算，提供可解释的注视模式，并展现出类人的感知行为。

Conclusion: AdaptiveNN为高效、灵活、可解释的计算机视觉提供了有前景的路径，并作为研究视觉认知的潜在工具，展现出与人类相似的感知特性。

Abstract: Human vision is highly adaptive, efficiently sampling intricate environments
by sequentially fixating on task-relevant regions. In contrast, prevailing
machine vision models passively process entire scenes at once, resulting in
excessive resource demands scaling with spatial-temporal input resolution and
model size, yielding critical limitations impeding both future advancements and
real-world application. Here we introduce AdaptiveNN, a general framework
aiming to drive a paradigm shift from 'passive' to 'active, adaptive' vision
models. AdaptiveNN formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential
decision-making process, progressively identifying and attending to regions
pertinent to the task, incrementally combining information across fixations,
and actively concluding observation when sufficient. We establish a theory
integrating representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning,
enabling end-to-end training of the non-differentiable AdaptiveNN without
additional supervision on fixation locations. We assess AdaptiveNN on 17
benchmarks spanning 9 tasks, including large-scale visual recognition,
fine-grained discrimination, visual search, processing images from real driving
and medical scenarios, language-driven embodied AI, and side-by-side
comparisons with humans. AdaptiveNN achieves up to 28x inference cost reduction
without sacrificing accuracy, flexibly adapts to varying task demands and
resource budgets without retraining, and provides enhanced interpretability via
its fixation patterns, demonstrating a promising avenue toward efficient,
flexible, and interpretable computer vision. Furthermore, AdaptiveNN exhibits
closely human-like perceptual behaviors in many cases, revealing its potential
as a valuable tool for investigating visual cognition. Code is available at

*Jiuyi Xu,Qing Jin,Meida Chen,Andrew Feng,Yang Sui,Yangming Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LowDiff是一种基于级联方法的新型高效扩散框架，通过从低分辨率到高分辨率逐步生成图像，显著提高了扩散模型的采样速度，在保持或提升生成质量的同时实现了超过50%的吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面取得了显著成功，但实际应用受到采样速度慢的限制。现有改进方法主要关注模型压缩或减少去噪步骤，而忽略了在生成过程中利用多分辨率输入的可能性。

Method: 提出LowDiff框架，采用级联方法从低分辨率到期望分辨率逐步生成图像，使用统一模型进行渐进式细化。该方法适用于像素空间和潜在空间的扩散模型。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、FFHQ和ImageNet上的实验表明，该方法在保持或提升质量的同时实现了显著的效率提升。在无条件CIFAR-10上FID为2.11，IS为9.87；在条件CIFAR-10上FID为1.94，IS为10.03；在ImageNet 256x256上FID为4.00，IS为195.06。

Conclusion: LowDiff通过级联多分辨率生成方法，在保持生成质量的同时大幅提升了扩散模型的效率，证明了利用多分辨率输入的有效性和通用性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but
their practical application is often hindered by the slow sampling speed. Prior
efforts of improving efficiency primarily focus on compressing models or
reducing the total number of denoising steps, largely neglecting the
possibility to leverage multiple input resolutions in the generation process.
In this work, we propose LowDiff, a novel and efficient diffusion framework
based on a cascaded approach by generating increasingly higher resolution
outputs. Besides, LowDiff employs a unified model to progressively refine
images from low resolution to the desired resolution. With the proposed
architecture design and generation techniques, we achieve comparable or even
superior performance with much fewer high-resolution sampling steps. LowDiff is
applicable to diffusion models in both pixel space and latent space. Extensive
experiments on both conditional and unconditional generation tasks across
CIFAR-10, FFHQ and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our
method. Results show over 50% throughput improvement across all datasets and
settings while maintaining comparable or better quality. On unconditional
CIFAR-10, LowDiff achieves an FID of 2.11 and IS of 9.87, while on conditional
CIFAR-10, an FID of 1.94 and IS of 10.03. On FFHQ 64x64, LowDiff achieves an
FID of 2.43, and on ImageNet 256x256, LowDiff built on LightningDiT-B/1
produces high-quality samples with a FID of 4.00 and an IS of 195.06, together
with substantial efficiency gains.

*Yu Chang,Jiahao Chen,Anzhe Cheng,Paul Bogdan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaskAttn-SDXL是一种针对Stable Diffusion XL的改进方法，通过在交叉注意力logits中注入二进制掩码来减少多对象提示中的组合失败问题，提高空间合规性和属性绑定能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型在实现高真实度的同时，经常在处理包含多个对象、属性和空间关系的提示时出现组合失败，导致实体纠缠、属性混淆和空间线索违反等问题。

Method: 提出MaskAttn-SDXL方法，在SDXL的UNet交叉注意力logits中应用区域级门控机制，为每层学习一个二进制掩码，在softmax之前注入到交叉注意力logit图中，稀疏化token与潜在空间之间的交互，只保留语义相关的连接。

Result: 该方法在不使用位置编码、辅助token或外部区域掩码的情况下，提高了多对象提示中的空间合规性和属性绑定能力，同时保持了整体图像质量和多样性，推理路径保持不变且开销极小。

Conclusion: 研究表明，logit级别的掩码交叉注意力是实现组合控制的数据高效原语，该方法可作为文本到图像生成中空间控制的实用扩展。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models achieve impressive realism but often suffer
from compositional failures on prompts with multiple objects, attributes, and
spatial relations, resulting in cross-token interference where entities
entangle, attributes mix across objects, and spatial cues are violated. To
address these failures, we propose MaskAttn-SDXL,a region-level gating
mechanism applied to the cross-attention logits of Stable Diffusion XL(SDXL)'s
UNet. MaskAttn-SDXL learns a binary mask per layer, injecting it into each
cross-attention logit map before softmax to sparsify token-to-latent
interactions so that only semantically relevant connections remain active. The
method requires no positional encodings, auxiliary tokens, or external region
masks, and preserves the original inference path with negligible overhead. In
practice, our model improves spatial compliance and attribute binding in
multi-object prompts while preserving overall image quality and diversity.
These findings demonstrate that logit-level maksed cross-attention is an
data-efficient primitve for enforcing compositional control, and our method
thus serves as a practical extension for spatial control in text-to-image
generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出RaceGAN，一种新颖的多域图像到图像转换框架，专门用于种族特征转换，能够在保持个体特征和高级语义的同时映射多个域的样式代码，无需参考图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型如CycleGAN、StarGAN等在种族特征转换方面存在局限性：要么只能处理成对域，要么无法深入映射低层样式变化，或者需要额外参考图像且无法保持个体特征。

Method: RaceGAN框架通过多域图像到图像转换技术，能够映射多个域的样式代码，在种族属性转换过程中保持个体特征和高级语义，无需依赖参考图像。

Result: 在芝加哥人脸数据集上的测试表明，RaceGAN在种族特征转换（亚洲人、白人和黑人）方面优于其他模型，并通过InceptionReNetv2分类验证了其有效性。模型还能将潜在空间划分为不同种族群体的明显聚类。

Conclusion: RaceGAN为种族特征转换提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够在保持个体特征的同时实现高质量的多域样式映射，无需参考图像，在种族属性转换任务上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated significant progress
in unpaired image-to-image translation in recent years for several
applications. CycleGAN was the first to lead the way, although it was
restricted to a pair of domains. StarGAN overcame this constraint by tackling
image-to-image translation across various domains, although it was not able to
map in-depth low-level style changes for these domains. Style mapping via
reference-guided image synthesis has been made possible by the innovations of
StarGANv2 and StyleGAN. However, these models do not maintain individuality and
need an extra reference image in addition to the input. Our study aims to
translate racial traits by means of multi-domain image-to-image translation. We
present RaceGAN, a novel framework capable of mapping style codes over several
domains during racial attribute translation while maintaining individuality and
high level semantics without relying on a reference image. RaceGAN outperforms
other models in translating racial features (i.e., Asian, White, and Black)
when tested on Chicago Face Dataset. We also give quantitative findings
utilizing InceptionReNetv2-based classification to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our racial translation. Moreover, we investigate how well the
model partitions the latent space into distinct clusters of faces for each
ethnic group.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型缺乏可解释性，现有方法要么局限于单个图像的局部视觉解释，要么需要大量标注的概念解释方法成本过高

Method: 利用少量图像的用户定义部分标签，通过高效迁移技术扩展到大数据集，聚合部分基础的局部解释形成全局符号解释

Result: 能够在大规模上为模型决策提供人类可理解的解释

Conclusion: 该方法在降低标注成本的同时，实现了从局部到全局的可解释性分析

Abstract: Deep learning models are notoriously opaque. Existing explanation methods
often focus on localized visual explanations for individual images.
Concept-based explanations, while offering global insights, require extensive
annotations, incurring significant labeling cost. We propose an approach that
leverages user-defined part labels from a limited set of images and efficiently
transfers them to a larger dataset. This enables the generation of global
symbolic explanations by aggregating part-based local explanations, ultimately
providing human-understandable explanations for model decisions on a large
scale.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于因果关系的生成模型指纹识别方法，通过解耦图像内容/风格与模型痕迹的因果关系，在语义不变的潜在空间中提取因果指纹，提高了模型溯源性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖模型特定线索或合成伪影，产生的指纹泛化能力有限。作者认为完整的模型指纹应反映图像来源与模型痕迹之间的因果关系，这一方向尚未被充分探索。

Method: 提出因果解耦框架，在预训练扩散重建残差导出的语义不变潜在空间中，将因果指纹从图像特定内容和风格中解耦出来，并通过多样化特征表示增强指纹粒度。

Result: 实验表明该方法在GAN和扩散模型的溯源任务中优于现有方法，并通过因果指纹生成的反事实示例实现了来源匿名化。

Conclusion: 该方法在伪造检测、模型版权追踪和身份保护方面具有强大潜力，验证了因果指纹概念的有效性。

Abstract: AI generative models leave implicit traces in their generated images, which
are commonly referred to as model fingerprints and are exploited for source
attribution. Prior methods rely on model-specific cues or synthesis artifacts,
yielding limited fingerprints that may generalize poorly across different
generative models. We argue that a complete model fingerprint should reflect
the causality between image provenance and model traces, a direction largely
unexplored. To this end, we conceptualize the \emph{causal fingerprint} of
generative models, and propose a causality-decoupling framework that
disentangles it from image-specific content and style in a semantic-invariant
latent space derived from pre-trained diffusion reconstruction residual. We
further enhance fingerprint granularity with diverse feature representations.
We validate causality by assessing attribution performance across
representative GANs and diffusion models and by achieving source anonymization
using counterfactual examples generated from causal fingerprints. Experiments
show our approach outperforms existing methods in model attribution, indicating
strong potential for forgery detection, model copyright tracing, and identity
protection.

TL;DR: 开发了神经肿瘤特异性基础模型，结合分布鲁棒优化，提高了跨机构分子标记预测和生存分析的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经肿瘤数据异质性和肿瘤复杂性限制了基础模型的泛化能力，现有模型在预测罕见分子标记方面表现不佳

Method: 使用自监督学习预训练多个骨干网络，应用分布鲁棒优化来缓解站点和类别不平衡问题

Result: 在多个机构验证中，分子预测准确率和AUC显著提升，生存分析的c-index在所有站点都有改善

Conclusion: 基础模型与分布鲁棒优化结合能够产生更站点不变的表征，提高常见和罕见标记的预测能力，增强生存区分度

Abstract: Neuro-oncology poses unique challenges for machine learning due to
heterogeneous data and tumor complexity, limiting the ability of foundation
models (FMs) to generalize across cohorts. Existing FMs also perform poorly in
predicting uncommon molecular markers, which are essential for treatment
response and risk stratification. To address these gaps, we developed a
neuro-oncology specific FM with a distributionally robust loss function,
enabling accurate estimation of tumor phenotypes while maintaining
cross-institution generalization. We pretrained self-supervised backbones
(BYOL, DINO, MAE, MoCo) on multi-institutional brain tumor MRI and applied
distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to mitigate site and class
imbalance. Downstream tasks included molecular classification of common markers
(MGMT, IDH1, 1p/19q, EGFR), uncommon alterations (ATRX, TP53, CDKN2A/2B, TERT),
continuous markers (Ki-67, TP53), and overall survival prediction in IDH1
wild-type glioblastoma at UCSF, UPenn, and CUIMC. Our method improved molecular
prediction and reduced site-specific embedding differences. At CUIMC, mean
balanced accuracy rose from 0.744 to 0.785 and AUC from 0.656 to 0.676, with
the largest gains for underrepresented endpoints (CDKN2A/2B accuracy 0.86 to
0.92, AUC 0.73 to 0.92; ATRX AUC 0.69 to 0.82; Ki-67 accuracy 0.60 to 0.69).
For survival, c-index improved at all sites: CUIMC 0.592 to 0.597, UPenn 0.647
to 0.672, UCSF 0.600 to 0.627. Grad-CAM highlighted tumor and peri-tumoral
regions, confirming interpretability. Overall, coupling FMs with DRO yields
more site-invariant representations, improves prediction of common and uncommon
markers, and enhances survival discrimination, underscoring the need for
prospective validation and integration of longitudinal and interventional
signals to advance precision neuro-oncology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ORCA是一个基于代理推理的框架，通过测试时结构化推理来提高预训练大视觉语言模型的事实准确性和对抗鲁棒性，使用小于3B参数的小视觉模型工具套件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大视觉语言模型存在幻觉问题和对抗攻击脆弱性，限制了其在现实应用中的可靠性。

Method: ORCA采用观察-推理-批判-行动的循环机制，通过查询多个视觉工具、验证跨模型不一致性，并在不访问模型内部或重新训练的情况下迭代优化预测。

Result: 在POPE幻觉基准测试中，ORCA将独立LVLM性能提升了3.64%到40.67%；在对抗扰动下平均准确率提升20.11%；结合防御技术后性能提升1.20%到48.00%。

Conclusion: ORCA为构建更可靠和鲁棒的多模态系统提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit strong multimodal capabilities
but remain vulnerable to hallucinations from intrinsic errors and adversarial
attacks from external exploitations, limiting their reliability in real-world
applications. We present ORCA, an agentic reasoning framework that improves the
factual accuracy and adversarial robustness of pretrained LVLMs through
test-time structured inference reasoning with a suite of small vision models
(less than 3B parameters). ORCA operates via an Observe--Reason--Critique--Act
loop, querying multiple visual tools with evidential questions, validating
cross-model inconsistencies, and refining predictions iteratively without
access to model internals or retraining. ORCA also stores intermediate
reasoning traces, which supports auditable decision-making. Though designed
primarily to mitigate object-level hallucinations, ORCA also exhibits emergent
adversarial robustness without requiring adversarial training or defense
mechanisms. We evaluate ORCA across three settings: (1) clean images on
hallucination benchmarks, (2) adversarially perturbed images without defense,
and (3) adversarially perturbed images with defense applied. On the POPE
hallucination benchmark, ORCA improves standalone LVLM performance by +3.64\%
to +40.67\% across different subsets. Under adversarial perturbations on POPE,
ORCA achieves an average accuracy gain of +20.11\% across LVLMs. When combined
with defense techniques on adversarially perturbed AMBER images, ORCA further
improves standalone LVLM performance, with gains ranging from +1.20\% to
+48.00\% across evaluation metrics. These results demonstrate that ORCA offers
a promising path toward building more reliable and robust multimodal systems.

TL;DR: RAD-Conv是一种新的卷积算子，通过四个边界偏移量创建灵活的矩形区域，动态调整感受野大小和形状，结合注意力机制的适应性和标准卷积的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可变形卷积局限于固定四边形采样区域，无法灵活适应复杂图像结构。需要一种既能精确控制感受野形状，又能保持计算效率的方法。

Method: 使用四个边界偏移量替代传统的单一偏移量，为每个卷积核元素创建可调整的矩形采样区域，实现感受野宽度和高度的解耦控制。

Result: RAD-Conv能够捕捉局部细节和长距离依赖关系，即使使用1x1小卷积核也能获得良好的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该方法在卷积架构的刚性和注意力机制的计算成本之间找到了平衡，为构建更具表达力和效率的视觉模型提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Region-Aware Deformable Convolution (RAD-Conv), a new
convolutional operator that enhances neural networks' ability to adapt to
complex image structures. Unlike traditional deformable convolutions, which are
limited to fixed quadrilateral sampling areas, RAD-Conv uses four boundary
offsets per kernel element to create flexible, rectangular regions that
dynamically adjust their size and shape to match image content. This approach
allows precise control over the receptive field's width and height, enabling
the capture of both local details and long-range dependencies, even with small
1x1 kernels. By decoupling the receptive field's shape from the kernel's
structure, RAD-Conv combines the adaptability of attention mechanisms with the
efficiency of standard convolutions. This innovative design offers a practical
solution for building more expressive and efficient vision models, bridging the
gap between rigid convolutional architectures and computationally costly
attention-based methods.

Conclusion: CAGE框架通过边缘中心表示和双查询解码器设计，显著提高了平面图重建的鲁棒性和几何连续性，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: We present \textbf{CAGE} (\textit{Continuity-Aware edGE}) network, a
\textcolor{red}{robust} framework for reconstructing vector floorplans directly
from point-cloud density maps. Traditional corner-based polygon representations
are highly sensitive to noise and incomplete observations, often resulting in
fragmented or implausible layouts. Recent line grouping methods leverage
structural cues to improve robustness but still struggle to recover fine
geometric details. To address these limitations, we propose a \textit{native}
edge-centric formulation, modeling each wall segment as a directed,
geometrically continuous edge. This representation enables inference of
coherent floorplan structures, ensuring watertight, topologically valid room
boundaries while improving robustness and reducing artifacts. Towards this
design, we develop a dual-query transformer decoder that integrates perturbed
and latent queries within a denoising framework, which not only stabilizes
optimization but also accelerates convergence. Extensive experiments on
Structured3D and SceneCAD show that \textbf{CAGE} achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with F1 scores of 99.1\% (rooms), 91.7\% (corners), and 89.3\%
(angles). The method also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization,
underscoring the efficacy of our architectural innovations. Code and pretrained
models will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: The development of multimodal models for pulmonary nodule diagnosis is
limited by the scarcity of labeled data and the tendency for these models to
overfit on the training distribution. In this work, we leverage self-supervised
learning from longitudinal and multimodal archives to address these challenges.
We curate an unlabeled set of patients with CT scans and linked electronic
health records from our home institution to power joint embedding predictive
architecture (JEPA) pretraining. After supervised finetuning, we show that our
approach outperforms an unregularized multimodal model and imaging-only model
in an internal cohort (ours: 0.91, multimodal: 0.88, imaging-only: 0.73 AUC),
but underperforms in an external cohort (ours: 0.72, imaging-only: 0.75 AUC).
We develop a synthetic environment that characterizes the context in which JEPA
may underperform. This work innovates an approach that leverages unlabeled
multimodal medical archives to improve predictive models and demonstrates its
advantages and limitations in pulmonary nodule diagnosis.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small dataset from a large dataset,
enabling the model trained on it to perform well on the original dataset. With
the blooming of large language models and multimodal large language models, the
importance of multimodal datasets, particularly image-text datasets, has grown
significantly. However, existing multimodal dataset distillation methods are
constrained by the Matching Training Trajectories algorithm, which
significantly increases the computing resource requirement, and takes days to
process the distillation. In this work, we introduce EDGE, a generative
distillation method for efficient multimodal dataset distillation.
Specifically, we identify two key challenges of distilling multimodal datasets
with generative models: 1) The lack of correlation between generated images and
captions. 2) The lack of diversity among generated samples. To address the
aforementioned issues, we propose a novel generative model training workflow
with a bi-directional contrastive loss and a diversity loss. Furthermore, we
propose a caption synthesis strategy to further improve text-to-image retrieval
performance by introducing more text information. Our method is evaluated on
Flickr30K, COCO, and CC3M datasets, demonstrating superior performance and
efficiency compared to existing approaches. Notably, our method achieves
results 18x faster than the state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Recent successful video generation systems that predict and create realistic
automotive driving scenes from short video inputs assign tokenization, future

scenes. Our contributions are: Unlike several earlier works for video
generation, such as GAIA-1, we provide a deep analysis of the three components
of our system by separate quantitative and qualitative evaluation: Image
tokenizer, world model, video decoder. Second, we purely build upon powerful
pre-trained open source models from various domains, which we fine-tune by
publicly available automotive data (BDD100K) on GPU hardware at academic scale.
Third, we build a coherent video generation system by streamlining interfaces
of our components. Fourth, due to public availability of the underlying models
and data, we allow full reproducibility. Finally, we also publish our code and
models on Github. For an image size of 256x256 at 4 fps we are able to predict
realistic driving scene videos frame-by-frame with only one frame of
algorithmic latency.

### [27] [Comparing Computational Pathology Foundation Models using Representational Similarity Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15482)
*Vaibhav Mishra,William Lotter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了6种计算病理学基础模型的表示空间结构，发现不同训练范式（视觉语言对比学习vs自蒸馏）的模型表示结构差异显著，且所有模型都表现出高切片依赖性但低疾病依赖性。染色归一化能有效降低切片依赖性，视觉语言模型具有更紧凑的表示结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基础模型在计算病理学中的快速发展，虽然已有研究评估模型的任务性能，但对这些模型学习表示的结构和变异性了解不足。本文旨在系统分析不同CPath基础模型的表示空间特征。

Method: 使用计算神经科学中的表示相似性分析技术，分析6种CPath基础模型（CONCH、PLIP、KEEP、UNI2、Virchow2、Prov-GigaPath）在TCGA H&E图像块上的表示结构，评估切片依赖性、疾病依赖性和内在维度等特征。

Result: UNI2和Virchow2具有最独特的表示结构，Prov-GigaPath具有最高的平均相似性；相同训练范式不保证更高的表示相似性；所有模型都表现出高切片依赖性和相对较低的疾病依赖性；染色归一化能降低5.5%-20.5%的切片依赖性；视觉语言模型表示更紧凑。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了改进模型对切片特异性特征鲁棒性的机会，为模型集成策略提供信息，并深入理解训练范式如何塑造模型表示。该框架可扩展到医学影像领域，帮助确保基础模型的有效开发和部署。

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly developed in computational pathology
(CPath) given their promise in facilitating many downstream tasks. While recent
studies have evaluated task performance across models, less is known about the
structure and variability of their learned representations. Here, we
systematically analyze the representational spaces of six CPath foundation
models using techniques popularized in computational neuroscience. The models
analyzed span vision-language contrastive learning (CONCH, PLIP, KEEP) and
self-distillation (UNI (v2), Virchow (v2), Prov-GigaPath) approaches. Through
representational similarity analysis using H&E image patches from TCGA, we find
that UNI2 and Virchow2 have the most distinct representational structures,
whereas Prov-Gigapath has the highest average similarity across models. Having
the same training paradigm (vision-only vs. vision-language) did not guarantee
higher representational similarity. The representations of all models showed a
high slide-dependence, but relatively low disease-dependence. Stain
normalization decreased slide-dependence for all models by a range of 5.5%
(CONCH) to 20.5% (PLIP). In terms of intrinsic dimensionality, vision-language
models demonstrated relatively compact representations, compared to the more
distributed representations of vision-only models. These findings highlight
opportunities to improve robustness to slide-specific features, inform model
ensembling strategies, and provide insights into how training paradigms shape
model representations. Our framework is extendable across medical imaging
domains, where probing the internal representations of foundation models can
help ensure effective development and deployment.

Motivation: 当前最先进的视觉语言模型通常依赖极大模型，计算和内存需求过高，难以在资源受限的环境（如仓库、机器人和工业应用）中部署，而这些环境需要高效且鲁棒的空间理解能力。

Method: SmolRGPT采用三阶段课程学习：逐步对齐视觉和语言特征、实现空间关系理解、适应任务特定数据集，并整合RGB和深度线索进行区域级空间推理。

Conclusion: 这些发现凸显了在现实世界环境中实现高效、可部署的多模态智能的潜力，而无需牺牲核心空间推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled powerful
multimodal reasoning, but state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on
extremely large models with prohibitive computational and memory requirements.
This makes their deployment challenging in resource-constrained environments
such as warehouses, robotics, and industrial applications, where both
efficiency and robust spatial understanding are critical. In this work, we
present SmolRGPT, a compact vision-language architecture that explicitly
incorporates region-level spatial reasoning by integrating both RGB and depth
cues. SmolRGPT employs a three-stage curriculum that progressively align visual
and language features, enables spatial relationship understanding, and adapts
to task-specific datasets. We demonstrate that with only 600M parameters,
SmolRGPT achieves competitive results on challenging warehouse spatial
reasoning benchmarks, matching or exceeding the performance of much larger
alternatives. These findings highlight the potential for efficient, deployable
multimodal intelligence in real-world settings without sacrificing core spatial
reasoning capabilities. The code of the experimentation will be available at:

yielded 800 test cases, Lynx has demonstrated superior face resemblance,
competitive prompt following, and strong video quality, thereby advancing the

Conclusion: 所提出的可逆剪枝方法为后门防御提供了一种有效且可解释的解决方案，在保持主任务性能的同时有效消除后门行为

Abstract: Model pruning has gained traction as a promising defense strategy against
backdoor attacks in deep learning. However, existing pruning-based approaches
often fall short in accurately identifying and removing the specific parameters
responsible for inducing backdoor behaviors. Despite the dominance of
fine-tuning-based defenses in recent literature, largely due to their superior
performance, pruning remains a compelling alternative, offering greater
interpretability and improved robustness in low-data regimes. In this paper, we
propose a novel pruning approach featuring a learned \emph{selection} mechanism
to identify parameters critical to both main and backdoor tasks, along with an
\emph{invertible} pruning mask designed to simultaneously achieve two
complementary goals: eliminating the backdoor task while preserving it through
the inverse mask. We formulate this as a bi-level optimization problem that
jointly learns selection variables, a sparse invertible mask, and
sample-specific backdoor perturbations derived from clean data. The inner
problem synthesizes candidate triggers using the inverse mask, while the outer
problem refines the mask to suppress backdoor behavior without impairing
clean-task accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing pruning-based backdoor mitigation approaches, maintains
strong performance under limited data conditions, and achieves competitive
results compared to state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Notably, the
proposed approach is particularly effective in restoring correct predictions
for compromised samples after successful backdoor mitigation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了最大熵编码量化（MEC-Quant）方法，通过优化表示结构来减少量化偏差，在极低比特设置下实现与全精度模型相当甚至更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前量化感知训练（QAT）方法在性能上仍劣于全精度模型，特别是在极低比特设置下，量化会不可避免地引入表示偏差。

Method: 提出MEC-Quant方法，利用有损数据编码中的最小编码长度作为熵的计算可处理替代，并基于混合专家（MOE）推导出可扩展的目标函数重构，实现快速计算并处理长尾分布。

Result: 在多种计算机视觉任务上的实验证明，MEC-Quant首次将QAT的极限推至x比特激活，其准确率可与全精度模型相媲美甚至超越，建立了QAT的新最先进水平。

Conclusion: MEC-Quant通过更原则性的目标函数优化表示结构，有效减少了量化偏差，在保持高效性的同时显著提升了量化模型的性能表现。

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) has driven much attention to produce
efficient neural networks. Current QAT still obtains inferior performances
compared with the Full Precision (FP) counterpart. In this work, we argue that
quantization inevitably introduce biases into the learned representation,
especially under the extremely low-bit setting. To cope with this issue, we
propose Maximum Entropy Coding Quantization (MEC-Quant), a more principled
objective that explicitly optimizes on the structure of the representation, so
that the learned representation is less biased and thus generalizes better to
unseen in-distribution samples. To make the objective end-to-end trainable, we
propose to leverage the minimal coding length in lossy data coding as a
computationally tractable surrogate for the entropy, and further derive a
scalable reformulation of the objective based on Mixture Of Experts (MOE) that
not only allows fast computation but also handles the long-tailed distribution
for weights or activation values. Extensive experiments on various tasks on
computer vision tasks prove its superiority. With MEC-Qaunt, the limit of QAT
is pushed to the x-bit activation for the first time and the accuracy of
MEC-Quant is comparable to or even surpass the FP counterpart. Without bells
and whistles, MEC-Qaunt establishes a new state of the art for QAT.

Conclusion: GUI-ARP在GUI定位任务中表现出色，小模型就能达到与大模型竞争的性能，证明了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Existing GUI grounding methods often struggle with fine-grained localization
in high-resolution screenshots. To address this, we propose GUI-ARP, a novel
framework that enables adaptive multi-stage inference. Equipped with the
proposed Adaptive Region Perception (ARP) and Adaptive Stage Controlling (ASC),
GUI-ARP dynamically exploits visual attention for cropping task-relevant
regions and adapts its inference strategy, performing a single-stage inference
for simple cases and a multi-stage analysis for more complex scenarios. This is
achieved through a two-phase training pipeline that integrates supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement fine-tuning based on Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed
GUI-ARP achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging GUI grounding
benchmarks, with a 7B model reaching 60.8% accuracy on ScreenSpot-Pro and 30.9%
on UI-Vision benchmark. Notably, GUI-ARP-7B demonstrates strong competitiveness
against open-source 72B models (UI-TARS-72B at 38.1%) and proprietary models.

Abstract: World models allow agents to simulate the consequences of actions in imagined
environments for planning, control, and long-horizon decision-making. However,
existing autoregressive world models struggle with visually coherent
predictions due to disrupted spatial structure, inefficient decoding, and
inadequate motion modeling. In response, we propose \textbf{S}cale-wise
\textbf{A}utoregression with \textbf{M}otion \textbf{P}r\textbf{O}mpt
(\textbf{SAMPO}), a hybrid framework that combines visual autoregressive
modeling for intra-frame generation with causal modeling for next-frame
generation. Specifically, SAMPO integrates temporal causal decoding with
bidirectional spatial attention, which preserves spatial locality and supports
parallel decoding within each scale. This design significantly enhances both
temporal consistency and rollout efficiency. To further improve dynamic scene
understanding, we devise an asymmetric multi-scale tokenizer that preserves
spatial details in observed frames and extracts compact dynamic representations
for future frames, optimizing both memory usage and model performance.
Additionally, we introduce a trajectory-aware motion prompt module that injects
spatiotemporal cues about object and robot trajectories, focusing attention on
dynamic regions and improving temporal consistency and physical realism.
Extensive experiments show that SAMPO achieves competitive performance in
action-conditioned video prediction and model-based control, improving
generation quality with 4.4$\times$ faster inference. We also evaluate SAMPO's
zero-shot generalization and scaling behavior, demonstrating its ability to
generalize to unseen tasks and benefit from larger model sizes.

Motivation: 现有方法在情感分析中主要关注语言线索而忽视图像作为补充的非语言线索，且专门针对人类欲望理解的多模态方法研究不足。

Method: 采用对称双向多模态学习框架，使用低分辨率图像获取全局视觉表示进行跨模态对齐，高分辨率图像分割为子图像并通过掩码图像建模捕捉细粒度局部特征，引入文本引导的图像解码器和图像引导的文本解码器促进深度跨模态交互。

Result: 在MSED数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在欲望理解、情感识别和情绪分析方面分别实现了1.1%、0.6%和0.9%的F1分数提升，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的对称双向多模态学习框架有效提升了欲望、情感和情绪识别的性能，验证了文本和图像模态相互指导策略的有效性。

Abstract: Desire, as an intention that drives human behavior, is closely related to
both emotion and sentiment. Multimodal learning has advanced sentiment and
emotion recognition, but multimodal approaches specially targeting human desire
understanding remain underexplored. And existing methods in sentiment analysis
predominantly emphasize verbal cues and overlook images as complementary
non-verbal cues. To address these gaps, we propose a Symmetrical Bidirectional
Multimodal Learning Framework for Desire, Emotion, and Sentiment Recognition,
which enforces mutual guidance between text and image modalities to effectively
capture intention-related representations in the image. Specifically,
low-resolution images are used to obtain global visual representations for
cross-modal alignment, while high resolution images are partitioned into
sub-images and modeled with masked image modeling to enhance the ability to
capture fine-grained local features. A text-guided image decoder and an
image-guided text decoder are introduced to facilitate deep cross-modal
interaction at both local and global representations of image information.
Additionally, to balance perceptual gains with computation cost, a mixed-scale
image strategy is adopted, where high-resolution images are cropped into
sub-images for masked modeling. The proposed approach is evaluated on MSED, a
multimodal dataset that includes a desire understanding benchmark, as well as
emotion and sentiment recognition. Experimental results indicate consistent
improvements over other state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness
of our proposed method. Specifically, our method outperforms existing
approaches, achieving F1-score improvements of 1.1% in desire understanding,
0.6% in emotion recognition, and 0.9% in sentiment analysis. Our code is

Motivation: 现有的Sa2VA方法结合LLM和SAM~2进行视频分割，但存在误报问题，需要更精确地验证查询内容与视频内容的匹配度

Method: 引入两个关键组件：1）视频-语言检查器，显式验证查询中的主体和动作是否出现在视频中；2）关键帧采样器，自适应选择信息丰富的帧来捕捉早期对象外观和长期时间上下文

Result: 在MeViS测试集上达到64.14%的J&F分数，在ICCV 2025第7届LSVOS挑战赛的RVOS赛道中排名第2

Conclusion: 提出的无需训练框架显著提升了Sa2VA的性能，证明了视频-语言检查和关键帧采样的有效性

Abstract: Referential Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment all objects in a
video that match a given natural language description, bridging the gap between
vision and language understanding. Recent work, such as Sa2VA, combines Large
Language Models (LLMs) with SAM~2, leveraging the strong video reasoning
capability of LLMs to guide video segmentation. In this work, we present a
training-free framework that substantially improves Sa2VA's performance on the
RVOS task. Our method introduces two key components: (1) a Video-Language
Checker that explicitly verifies whether the subject and action described in
the query actually appear in the video, thereby reducing false positives; and
(2) a Key-Frame Sampler that adaptively selects informative frames to better
capture both early object appearances and long-range temporal context. Without
any additional training, our approach achieves a J&F score of 64.14% on the
MeViS test set, ranking 2nd place in the RVOS track of the 7th LSVOS Challenge
at ICCV 2025.

Abstract: In-the-wild photo collections often contain limited volumes of imagery and
exhibit multiple appearances, e.g., taken at different times of day or seasons,
posing significant challenges to scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis.
Although recent adaptations of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have improved in these areas, they tend to oversmooth and are
prone to overfitting. In this paper, we present MS-GS, a novel framework
designed with Multi-appearance capabilities in Sparse-view scenarios using
3DGS. To address the lack of support due to sparse initializations, our
approach is built on the geometric priors elicited from monocular depth
estimations. The key lies in extracting and utilizing local semantic regions
with a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) points anchored algorithm for reliable
alignment and geometry cues. Then, to introduce multi-view constraints, we
propose a series of geometry-guided supervision at virtual views in a
fine-grained and coarse scheme to encourage 3D consistency and reduce
overfitting. We also introduce a dataset and an in-the-wild experiment setting
to set up more realistic benchmarks. We demonstrate that MS-GS achieves
photorealistic renderings under various challenging sparse-view and
multi-appearance conditions and outperforms existing approaches significantly
across different datasets.

Conclusion: Diff-Feat通过简单但有效的特征提取和融合策略，在多标签分类任务上实现了卓越性能，证明了扩散模型中间特征的重要价值。

Abstract: Multi-label classification has broad applications and depends on powerful
representations capable of capturing multi-label interactions. We introduce
\textit{Diff-Feat}, a simple but powerful framework that extracts intermediate
features from pre-trained diffusion-Transformer models for images and text, and
fuses them for downstream tasks. We observe that for vision tasks, the most
discriminative intermediate feature along the diffusion process occurs at the
middle step and is located in the middle block in Transformer. In contrast, for
language tasks, the best feature occurs at the noise-free step and is located
in the deepest block. In particular, we observe a striking phenomenon across
varying datasets: a mysterious "Layer $12$" consistently yields the best
performance on various downstream classification tasks for images (under
DiT-XL/2-256$\times$256). We devise a heuristic local-search algorithm that
pinpoints the locally optimal "image-text"$\times$"block-timestep" pair among a
few candidates, avoiding an exhaustive grid search. A simple fusion-linear
projection followed by addition-of the selected representations yields
state-of-the-art performance: 98.6\% mAP on MS-COCO-enhanced and 45.7\% mAP on
Visual Genome 500, surpassing strong CNN, graph, and Transformer baselines by a
wide margin. t-SNE and clustering metrics further reveal that
\textit{Diff-Feat} forms tighter semantic clusters than unimodal counterparts.

Abstract: Vision- and hearing-threatening diseases cause preventable disability,
especially in resource-constrained settings(RCS) with few specialists and
limited screening setup. Large scale AI-assisted screening and telehealth has
potential to expand early detection, but practical deployment is challenging in
paper-based workflows and limited documented field experience exist to build
upon. We provide insights on challenges and ways forward in development to
adoption of scalable AI-assisted Telehealth and screening in such settings.
Specifically, we find that iterative, interdisciplinary collaboration through
early prototyping, shadow deployment and continuous feedback is important to
build shared understanding as well as reduce usability hurdles when
transitioning from paper-based to AI-ready workflows. We find public datasets
and AI models highly useful despite poor performance due to domain shift. In
addition, we find the need for automated AI-based image quality check to
capture gradable images for robust screening in high-volume camps.
  Our field learning stress the importance of treating AI development and
workflow digitization as an end-to-end, iterative co-design process. By
documenting these practical challenges and lessons learned, we aim to address
the gap in contextual, actionable field knowledge for building real-world
AI-assisted telehealth and mass-screening programs in RCS.

Motivation: 现有的遥感变化检测方法（包括最先进的状态空间模型）缺乏明确的几何错位处理机制，难以区分细微的真实变化和噪声。

Method: 提出DC-Mamba框架，包含两个轻量级即插即用模块：双时相可变形对齐模块（BTDA）用于语义特征级别的几何对齐，尺度稀疏变化放大器（SSCA）用于选择性增强高置信度变化信号并抑制噪声。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著优于ChangeMamba基线，F1分数从0.5730提升至0.5903，IoU从0.4015提升至0.4187。

Conclusion: "先对齐后增强"策略有效解决了遥感变化检测中的几何和特征级挑战，提供了一个鲁棒且易于部署的解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) is vital for identifying land-cover
changes, yet existing methods, including state-of-the-art State Space Models
(SSMs), often lack explicit mechanisms to handle geometric misalignments and
struggle to distinguish subtle, true changes from noise.To address this, we
introduce DC-Mamba, an "align-then-enhance" framework built upon the
ChangeMamba backbone. It integrates two lightweight, plug-and-play modules: (1)
Bi-Temporal Deformable Alignment (BTDA), which explicitly introduces geometric
awareness to correct spatial misalignments at the semantic feature level; and
(2) a Scale-Sparse Change Amplifier(SSCA), which uses multi-source cues to
selectively amplify high-confidence change signals while suppressing noise
before the final classification. This synergistic design first establishes
geometric consistency with BTDA to reduce pseudo-changes, then leverages SSCA
to sharpen boundaries and enhance the visibility of small or subtle targets.
Experiments show our method significantly improves performance over the strong
ChangeMamba baseline, increasing the F1-score from 0.5730 to 0.5903 and IoU
from 0.4015 to 0.4187. The results confirm the effectiveness of our
"align-then-enhance" strategy, offering a robust and easily deployable solution
that transparently addresses both geometric and feature-level challenges in
RSCD.

TL;DR: 提出了“Blink-Think-Link”框架，模仿人类认知过程进行GUI交互，通过眨眼检测、思考推理和链接执行三个阶段，结合自动标注和强化学习奖励机制，在GUI理解和交互任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI驱动的GUI交互自动化虽然取得了显著进展，但其交互逻辑与自然的人类-GUI通信模式存在显著偏差，需要更符合人类认知过程的交互框架。

Method: 提出BTL框架，将交互分解为三个生物启发阶段：Blink（快速检测和注意力分配）、Think（高级推理和决策）、Link（生成可执行命令）。引入Blink数据生成自动标注管道和基于规则的BTL奖励机制。

Result: 开发的BTL-UI模型在静态GUI理解和动态交互任务的综合基准测试中表现出持续的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为开发高级GUI代理提供了有效的实证验证，证明了其在模拟人类认知过程方面的有效性。

Abstract: In the field of AI-driven human-GUI interaction automation, while rapid
advances in multimodal large language models and reinforcement fine-tuning
techniques have yielded remarkable progress, a fundamental challenge persists:
their interaction logic significantly deviates from natural human-GUI
communication patterns. To fill this gap, we propose "Blink-Think-Link" (BTL),
a brain-inspired framework for human-GUI interaction that mimics the human
cognitive process between users and graphical interfaces. The system decomposes
interactions into three biologically plausible phases: (1) Blink - rapid
detection and attention to relevant screen areas, analogous to saccadic eye
movements; (2) Think - higher-level reasoning and decision-making, mirroring
cognitive planning; and (3) Link - generation of executable commands for
precise motor control, emulating human action selection mechanisms.
Additionally, we introduce two key technical innovations for the BTL framework:
(1) Blink Data Generation - an automated annotation pipeline specifically
optimized for blink data, and (2) BTL Reward -- the first rule-based reward
mechanism that enables reinforcement learning driven by both process and
outcome. Building upon this framework, we develop a GUI agent model named
BTL-UI, which demonstrates consistent state-of-the-art performance across both
static GUI understanding and dynamic interaction tasks in comprehensive
benchmarks. These results provide conclusive empirical validation of the
framework's efficacy in developing advanced GUI Agents.

*Shilong Bao,Qianqian Xu,Feiran Li,Boyu Han,Zhiyong Yang,Xiaochun Cao,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文揭示了显著目标检测(SOD)评估协议中的尺寸不变性问题，提出了尺寸不变性评估框架SIEva和优化框架SIOpt，解决了多尺寸显著目标检测中的评估偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SOD评估指标对目标尺寸敏感，导致大尺寸区域主导评估结果，而小尺寸但语义重要的目标被忽略，造成性能评估偏差。

Method: 提出SIEva评估框架，通过分解评估结果为可分离项并独立评估每个组件；开发SIOpt优化框架，基于尺寸不变性原则增强多尺寸目标检测能力。

Result: 理论分析证明了新评估协议的有效性，实验验证了所提方法能显著提升不同尺寸显著目标的检测性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为SOD领域提供了更公平的评估标准，提出的模型无关框架可广泛应用于各种SOD骨干网络。

Abstract: This paper investigates a fundamental yet underexplored issue in Salient
Object Detection (SOD): the size-invariant property for evaluation protocols,
particularly in scenarios when multiple salient objects of significantly
different sizes appear within a single image. We first present a novel
perspective to expose the inherent size sensitivity of existing widely used SOD
metrics. Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation
outcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed
into a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being
directly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the
prediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet
potentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading
to biased performance assessments and practical degradation. To address this
challenge, a generic Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework is proposed.
The core idea is to evaluate each separable component individually and then
aggregate the results, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of size
imbalance across objects. Building upon this, we further develop a dedicated
optimization framework (SIOpt), which adheres to the size-invariant principle
and significantly enhances the detection of salient objects across a broad
range of sizes. Notably, SIOpt is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly
integrated with a wide range of SOD backbones. Theoretically, we also present
generalization analysis of SOD methods and provide evidence supporting the
validity of our new evaluation protocols. Finally, comprehensive experiments
speak to the efficacy of our proposed approach. The code is available at

Multi-Modal Feature Fusion module to ensure robust performance even with
incomplete data. Additionally, we contribute a comprehensive dataset VESV
(VEracity on Short Videos) specifically designed for short video fake news
detection. Experiments conducted on the FakeTT and newly collected VESV
datasets demonstrate improvements of 2.71% and 4.14% in Marco F1 over

Abstract: MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) have showcased remarkable
capabilities, but their performance in high-stakes, domain-specific scenarios
like surgical settings, remains largely under-explored. To address this gap, we
develop \textbf{EyePCR}, a large-scale benchmark for ophthalmic surgery
analysis, grounded in structured clinical knowledge to evaluate cognition
across \textit{Perception}, \textit{Comprehension} and \textit{Reasoning}.
EyePCR offers a richly annotated corpus with more than 210k VQAs, which cover
1048 fine-grained attributes for multi-view perception, medical knowledge graph
of more than 25k triplets for comprehension, and four clinically grounded
reasoning tasks. The rich annotations facilitate in-depth cognitive analysis,
simulating how surgeons perceive visual cues and combine them with domain
knowledge to make decisions, thus greatly improving models' cognitive ability.
In particular, \textbf{EyePCR-MLLM}, a domain-adapted variant of Qwen2.5-VL-7B,
achieves the highest accuracy on MCQs for \textit{Perception} among compared
models and outperforms open-source models in \textit{Comprehension} and
\textit{Reasoning}, rivalling commercial models like GPT-4.1. EyePCR reveals
the limitations of existing MLLMs in surgical cognition and lays the foundation
for benchmarking and enhancing clinical reliability of surgical video

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在一般视频理解方面表现出色，但在处理快速、高频的网球运动时存在困难，因为网球回合片段短小但信息密集。需要系统评估模型在这一挑战性领域的表现。

Method: 将每个网球回合建模为时间顺序的连续击球事件序列，使用自动化流程进行筛选和问题生成。构建了包含8个任务和2500个人工验证问题的TennisTV基准。

Result: 对16个代表性MLLM进行评估，发现模型存在显著不足，并得出两个关键见解：(i)帧采样密度应根据任务进行定制和平衡；(ii)改进时间定位对于更强的推理能力至关重要。

Conclusion: TennisTV基准为网球视频理解提供了首个系统性评估，揭示了当前MLLM在处理快速运动视频时的局限性，并指出了改进方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at general video understanding
but struggle with fast, high-frequency sports like tennis, where rally clips
are short yet information-dense. To systematically evaluate MLLMs in this
challenging domain, we present TennisTV, the first and most comprehensive
benchmark for tennis video understanding. TennisTV models each rally as a
temporal-ordered sequence of consecutive stroke events, using automated
pipelines for filtering and question generation. It covers 8 tasks at rally and
stroke levels and includes 2,500 human-verified questions. Evaluating 16
representative MLLMs, we provide the first systematic assessment of tennis
video understanding. Results reveal substantial shortcomings and yield two key
insights: (i) frame-sampling density should be tailored and balanced across
tasks, and (ii) improving temporal grounding is essential for stronger

*Zheng Wang,Hong Liu,Zheng Wang,Danyi Li,Min Cen,Baptiste Magnier,Li Liang,Liansheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于病理报告辅助的自蒸馏框架（Rasa），用于全切片图像（WSI）的生存分析，通过LLM提取病理报告中的细粒度文本描述，并利用自蒸馏和风险感知混合策略提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统WSI生存分析面临特征噪声大和数据可及性有限的问题，而病理报告包含丰富的患者特异性信息但未被充分利用。

Method: 1. 使用LLM从原始病理报告中提取WSI相关的细粒度文本描述；2. 设计自蒸馏管道，在教师模型文本知识指导下过滤学生模型的无关特征；3. 在学生模型训练中引入风险感知混合策略增加数据量和多样性。

Result: 在自收集数据（CRC）和公共数据（TCGA-BRCA）上的实验表明，Rasa方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Rasa框架有效整合了病理报告信息，通过自蒸馏和混合策略显著提升了WSI生存分析的性能。

Abstract: Survival analysis based on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is crucial for
evaluating cancer prognosis, as they offer detailed microscopic information
essential for predicting patient outcomes. However, traditional WSI-based
survival analysis usually faces noisy features and limited data accessibility,
hindering their ability to capture critical prognostic features effectively.
Although pathology reports provide rich patient-specific information that could
assist analysis, their potential to enhance WSI-based survival analysis remains
largely unexplored. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Report-auxiliary
self-distillation (Rasa) framework for WSI-based survival analysis. First,
advanced large language models (LLMs) are utilized to extract fine-grained,
WSI-relevant textual descriptions from original noisy pathology reports via a
carefully designed task prompt. Next, a self-distillation-based pipeline is
designed to filter out irrelevant or redundant WSI features for the student
model under the guidance of the teacher model's textual knowledge. Finally, a
risk-aware mix-up strategy is incorporated during the training of the student
model to enhance both the quantity and diversity of the training data.
Extensive experiments carried out on our collected data (CRC) and public data
(TCGA-BRCA) demonstrate the superior effectiveness of Rasa against
state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出PCSR框架，通过伪标签一致性指导样本细化，解决跨模态检索中噪声对应问题，提升检索鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设图像-文本对完美对齐，忽略了真实数据中的噪声对应问题。这些错配对会误导相似性学习并降低检索性能。

Method: 提出PCSR框架：1）基于置信度估计区分干净和噪声对；2）通过伪标签一致性细化噪声对；3）提出PCS评分量化预测稳定性；4）采用自适应对优化策略。

Result: 在CC152K、MS-COCO和Flickr30K数据集上的实验验证了该方法在噪声监督下提升检索鲁棒性的有效性。

Conclusion: PCSR框架通过细粒度样本划分和自适应优化策略，有效处理跨模态检索中的噪声对应问题，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Cross-modal retrieval aims to align different modalities via semantic
similarity. However, existing methods often assume that image-text pairs are
perfectly aligned, overlooking Noisy Correspondences in real data. These
misaligned pairs misguide similarity learning and degrade retrieval
performance. Previous methods often rely on coarse-grained categorizations that
simply divide data into clean and noisy samples, overlooking the intrinsic
diversity within noisy instances. Moreover, they typically apply uniform
training strategies regardless of sample characteristics, resulting in
suboptimal sample utilization for model optimization. To address the above
challenges, we introduce a novel framework, called Pseudo-label
Consistency-Guided Sample Refinement (PCSR), which enhances correspondence
reliability by explicitly dividing samples based on pseudo-label consistency.
Specifically, we first employ a confidence-based estimation to distinguish
clean and noisy pairs, then refine the noisy pairs via pseudo-label consistency
to uncover structurally distinct subsets. We further proposed a Pseudo-label
Consistency Score (PCS) to quantify prediction stability, enabling the
separation of ambiguous and refinable samples within noisy pairs. Accordingly,
we adopt Adaptive Pair Optimization (APO), where ambiguous samples are
optimized with robust loss functions and refinable ones are enhanced via text
replacement during training. Extensive experiments on CC152K, MS-COCO and
Flickr30K validate the effectiveness of our method in improving retrieval
robustness under noisy supervision.

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对医学图像分割中异构数据场景的个性化联邦SAM框架，通过参数聚合和局部专家组件解决隐私保护和模型性能的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割需要跨机构数据共享，但隐私限制阻碍了这一过程。联邦学习虽然能解决隐私问题，但现有方法在处理复杂异构数据时表现不佳。SAM模型具有出色的分割能力，但其庞大编码器在联邦设置中面临挑战。

Method: 框架包含两个关键创新：(1) 个性化策略，仅聚合全局参数以捕捉跨客户端共性，同时保留设计的L-MoE组件以保持领域特定特征；(2) 解耦的全局-局部微调机制，通过知识蒸馏的师生范式弥合全局共享模型与个性化局部模型之间的差距。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的广泛实验验证了该方法显著提高了分割性能，实现了强大的跨域适应能力，并减少了通信开销。

Conclusion: 该个性化联邦SAM框架有效解决了医学图像分割中的隐私保护和异构数据挑战，为联邦学习在医疗领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for computer-aided diagnosis, yet
privacy constraints hinder data sharing across institutions. Federated learning
addresses this limitation, but existing approaches often rely on lightweight
architectures that struggle with complex, heterogeneous data. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) has shown outstanding segmentation capabilities;
however, its massive encoder poses significant challenges in federated
settings. In this work, we present the first personalized federated SAM
framework tailored for heterogeneous data scenarios in medical image
segmentation. Our framework integrates two key innovations: (1) a personalized
strategy that aggregates only the global parameters to capture cross-client
commonalities while retaining the designed L-MoE (Localized Mixture-of-Experts)
component to preserve domain-specific features; and (2) a decoupled
global-local fine-tuning mechanism that leverages a teacher-student paradigm
via knowledge distillation to bridge the gap between the global shared model
and the personalized local models, thereby mitigating overgeneralization.
Extensive experiments on two public datasets validate that our approach
significantly improves segmentation performance, achieves robust cross-domain
adaptation, and reduces communication overhead.

Abstract: The demand for joint RGB-visible and infrared perception is growing rapidly,
particularly to achieve robust performance under diverse weather conditions.
Although pre-trained models for RGB-visible and infrared data excel in their
respective domains, they often underperform in multimodal scenarios, such as
autonomous vehicles equipped with both sensors. To address this challenge, we
propose a biologically inspired UNified foundation model for Infrared and
Visible modalities (UNIV), featuring two key innovations. First, we introduce
Patch-wise Cross-modality Contrastive Learning (PCCL), an attention-guided
distillation framework that mimics retinal horizontal cells' lateral
inhibition, which enables effective cross-modal feature alignment while
remaining compatible with any transformer-based architecture. Second, our
dual-knowledge preservation mechanism emulates the retina's bipolar cell signal
routing - combining LoRA adapters (2% added parameters) with synchronous
distillation to prevent catastrophic forgetting, thereby replicating the
retina's photopic (cone-driven) and scotopic (rod-driven) functionality. To
support cross-modal learning, we introduce the MVIP dataset, the most
comprehensive visible-infrared benchmark to date. It contains 98,992 precisely
aligned image pairs spanning diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate UNIV's superior performance on infrared tasks (+1.7 mIoU in
semantic segmentation and +0.7 mAP in object detection) while maintaining 99%+
of the baseline performance on visible RGB tasks. Our code is available at

TL;DR: GS-Scale是一个针对3D高斯泼溅技术的内存高效训练系统，通过主机内存存储和智能数据传输策略，显著降低GPU内存需求3.3-5.6倍，同时保持训练速度，使消费级GPU能够处理大规模场景训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术虽然提供了高质量的图形渲染和快速渲染速度，但在大规模场景的高质量训练中面临GPU内存瓶颈，因为需要存储参数、梯度和优化器状态。

Method: GS-Scale将所有高斯存储在主机内存中，按需将子集传输到GPU进行前向和后向传播。系统采用三种优化：选择性卸载几何参数进行快速视锥剔除、参数转发将CPU优化器更新与GPU计算流水线化、延迟优化器更新以减少零梯度高斯的不必要内存访问。

Result: 在大型数据集上的评估显示，GS-Scale将GPU内存需求降低3.3-5.6倍，训练速度与不使用主机卸载的GPU相当。在RTX 4070移动GPU上，高斯数量从400万扩展到1800万，LPIPS指标提升23-35%。

Conclusion: GS-Scale成功解决了3D高斯泼溅技术在大规模场景训练中的内存瓶颈问题，使消费级GPU能够高效处理大规模训练任务，显著提升了训练的可扩展性和质量。

Abstract: The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting has revolutionized graphics rendering by
delivering high visual quality and fast rendering speeds. However, training
large-scale scenes at high quality remains challenging due to the substantial
memory demands required to store parameters, gradients, and optimizer states,
which can quickly overwhelm GPU memory. To address these limitations, we
propose GS-Scale, a fast and memory-efficient training system for 3D Gaussian
Splatting. GS-Scale stores all Gaussians in host memory, transferring only a
subset to the GPU on demand for each forward and backward pass. While this
dramatically reduces GPU memory usage, it requires frustum culling and
optimizer updates to be executed on the CPU, introducing slowdowns due to CPU's
limited compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate this, GS-Scale employs three
system-level optimizations: (1) selective offloading of geometric parameters
for fast frustum culling, (2) parameter forwarding to pipeline CPU optimizer
updates with GPU computation, and (3) deferred optimizer update to minimize
unnecessary memory accesses for Gaussians with zero gradients. Our extensive
evaluations on large-scale datasets demonstrate that GS-Scale significantly
lowers GPU memory demands by 3.3-5.6x, while achieving training speeds
comparable to GPU without host offloading. This enables large-scale 3D Gaussian
Splatting training on consumer-grade GPUs; for instance, GS-Scale can scale the
number of Gaussians from 4 million to 18 million on an RTX 4070 Mobile GPU,
leading to 23-35% LPIPS (learned perceptual image patch similarity)
improvement.

Abstract: Researchers have conducted many pioneer researches on contactless
fingerprints, yet the performance of contactless fingerprint recognition still
lags behind contact-based methods primary due to the insufficient contactless
fingerprint data with pose variations and lack of the usage of implicit 3D
fingerprint representations. In this paper, we introduce a novel contactless
fingerprint 3D registration, reconstruction and generation framework by
integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting, with the goal of offering a new paradigm for
contactless fingerprint recognition that integrates 3D fingerprint
reconstruction and generation. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
apply 3D Gaussian Splatting to the field of fingerprint recognition, and the
first to achieve effective 3D registration and complete reconstruction of
contactless fingerprints with sparse input images and without requiring camera
parameters information. Experiments on 3D fingerprint registration,
reconstruction, and generation prove that our method can accurately align and
reconstruct 3D fingerprints from 2D images, and sequentially generates
high-quality contactless fingerprints from 3D model, thus increasing the
performances for contactless fingerprint recognition.

Conclusion: 基于PCA的表面重建模型在处理不完整点云数据方面表现出色，特别是在缺失区域的结构推断和表面重建方面具有优势。

Abstract: Point cloud data represents a crucial category of information for
mathematical modeling, and surface reconstruction from such data is an
important task across various disciplines. However, during the scanning
process, the collected point cloud data may fail to cover the entire surface
due to factors such as high light-absorption rate and occlusions, resulting in
incomplete datasets. Inferring surface structures in data-missing regions and
successfully reconstructing the surface poses a challenge. In this paper, we
present a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based model for surface
reconstruction from incomplete point cloud data. Initially, we employ PCA to
estimate the normal information of the underlying surface from the available
point cloud data. This estimated normal information serves as a regularizer in
our model, guiding the reconstruction of the surface, particularly in areas
with missing data. Additionally, we introduce an operator-splitting method to
effectively solve the proposed model. Through systematic experimentation, we
demonstrate that our model successfully infers surface structures in
data-missing regions and well reconstructs the underlying surfaces,
outperforming existing methodologies.

*Gahye Lee,Hyomin Kim,Gwangjin Ju,Jooeun Son,Hyejeong Yoon,Seungyong Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Camera Splatting是一种新颖的视图优化框架，通过将相机建模为3D高斯分布（相机splat）并在表面附近放置虚拟相机来优化新视图合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂视图依赖现象（如强烈金属反射和复杂纹理）的捕获问题，相比最远视图采样方法提供更好的性能。

Method: 将每个相机建模为3D高斯分布（相机splat），在表面附近采样3D点放置虚拟相机（点相机），通过可微分地优化相机splat来观察目标分布。

Result: 优化的视图在捕获复杂视图依赖现象方面表现出优越性能，特别是在强烈金属反射和复杂纹理（如文字）的渲染上。

Conclusion: Camera Splatting框架为新颖视图合成提供了一种有效的优化方法，能够更好地处理复杂的视图依赖效果。

Abstract: We propose Camera Splatting, a novel view optimization framework for novel
view synthesis. Each camera is modeled as a 3D Gaussian, referred to as a
camera splat, and virtual cameras, termed point cameras, are placed at 3D
points sampled near the surface to observe the distribution of camera splats.
View optimization is achieved by continuously and differentiably refining the
camera splats so that desirable target distributions are observed from the
point cameras, in a manner similar to the original 3D Gaussian splatting.
Compared to the Farthest View Sampling (FVS) approach, our optimized views
demonstrate superior performance in capturing complex view-dependent phenomena,
including intense metallic reflections and intricate textures such as text.

### [53] [Layout Stroke Imitation: A Layout Guided Handwriting Stroke Generation for Style Imitation with Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15678)
*Sidra Hanif,Longin Jan Latecki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于条件扩散模型的手写笔画生成方法，通过多尺度注意力特征和词间距布局来模仿书法风格，在笔画生成任务上超越了现有最优方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手写笔画生成方法没有将词间距（词布局）作为显式的手写特征考虑，导致风格模仿时词间距不一致。笔画生成相比图像生成能提供额外的时间坐标信息。

Method: 提出多尺度注意力特征来突出局部和全局风格特征；引入词布局特征以促进词间距控制；使用条件扩散模型进行笔画生成，而不是直接生成风格图像。

Result: 实验表明，提出的扩散模型在笔画生成任务上超越了当前最优方法，并与最近的图像生成网络具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 通过结合书法风格和词布局的条件扩散模型，能够实现更好的手写模仿和书法风格的笔画生成。

Abstract: Handwriting stroke generation is crucial for improving the performance of
tasks such as handwriting recognition and writers order recovery. In
handwriting stroke generation, it is significantly important to imitate the
sample calligraphic style. The previous studies have suggested utilizing the
calligraphic features of the handwriting. However, they had not considered word
spacing (word layout) as an explicit handwriting feature, which results in
inconsistent word spacing for style imitation. Firstly, this work proposes
multi-scale attention features for calligraphic style imitation. These
multi-scale feature embeddings highlight the local and global style features.
Secondly, we propose to include the words layout, which facilitates word
spacing for handwriting stroke generation. Moreover, we propose a conditional
diffusion model to predict strokes in contrast to previous work, which directly
generated style images. Stroke generation provides additional temporal
coordinate information, which is lacking in image generation. Hence, our
proposed conditional diffusion model for stroke generation is guided by
calligraphic style and word layout for better handwriting imitation and stroke
generation in a calligraphic style. Our experimentation shows that the proposed
diffusion model outperforms the current state-of-the-art stroke generation and
is competitive with recent image generation networks.

### [54] [Saccadic Vision for Fine-Grained Visual Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15688)
*Johann Schmidt,Sebastian Stober,Joachim Denzler,Paul Bodesheim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种受人类扫视视觉启发的两阶段细粒度视觉分类方法，通过外围特征提取和注视点采样来克服现有基于部件方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于部件的方法依赖复杂的定位网络，存在高空间冗余问题，难以确定最优部件数量。受人类扫视视觉启发，希望开发更高效的细粒度分类方法。

Method: 两阶段过程：首先提取外围特征生成采样图，然后使用权重共享编码器并行编码注视点补丁。采用情境化选择性注意力加权每个注视点补丁的影响，并使用非极大值抑制消除空间冗余。

Result: 在标准FGVC基准测试和具有挑战性的昆虫数据集上，该方法达到了与最先进方法相当的性能，并始终优于基线编码器。

Conclusion: 该方法通过模拟人类视觉机制有效解决了细粒度分类中的空间冗余问题，在多个数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) requires distinguishing between
visually similar categories through subtle, localized features - a task that
remains challenging due to high intra-class variability and limited inter-class
differences. Existing part-based methods often rely on complex localization
networks that learn mappings from pixel to sample space, requiring a deep
understanding of image content while limiting feature utility for downstream
tasks. In addition, sampled points frequently suffer from high spatial
redundancy, making it difficult to quantify the optimal number of required
parts. Inspired by human saccadic vision, we propose a two-stage process that
first extracts peripheral features (coarse view) and generates a sample map,
from which fixation patches are sampled and encoded in parallel using a
weight-shared encoder. We employ contextualized selective attention to weigh
the impact of each fixation patch before fusing peripheral and focus
representations. To prevent spatial collapse - a common issue in part-based
methods - we utilize non-maximum suppression during fixation sampling to
eliminate redundancy. Comprehensive evaluation on standard FGVC benchmarks
(CUB-200-2011, NABirds, Food-101 and Stanford-Dogs) and challenging insect
datasets (EU-Moths, Ecuador-Moths and AMI-Moths) demonstrates that our method
achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches while
consistently outperforming our baseline encoder.

*Cristian Sbrolli,Matteo Matteucci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneForge是一个增强3D点云与文本对比学习的框架，通过结构化多对象场景组合来解决3D-文本数据稀缺问题，显著提升多个3D视觉任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模3D-文本数据集稀缺的问题，通过结构化场景组合来丰富数据复杂性和多样性，从而改进3D-文本对比学习的效果。

Method: 利用单个3D形状构建具有明确空间关系的多对象场景，并通过大语言模型生成连贯的多对象描述，将这些结构化组合样本用于对比训练增强。

Result: 在ModelNet、ScanObjNN、Objaverse-LVIS、ScanNet等数据集上的零样本分类任务，以及ShapeNetPart上的少样本部件分割任务中取得显著性能提升，同时在3D视觉问答和检索任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: SceneForge的组成增强方法具有模型无关性，能够一致地提升多种编码器架构的性能，并展示了强大的空间推理能力，能够根据文本指令精确调整空间配置。

Abstract: The whole is greater than the sum of its parts-even in 3D-text contrastive
learning. We introduce SceneForge, a novel framework that enhances contrastive
alignment between 3D point clouds and text through structured multi-object
scene compositions. SceneForge leverages individual 3D shapes to construct
multi-object scenes with explicit spatial relations, pairing them with coherent
multi-object descriptions refined by a large language model. By augmenting
contrastive training with these structured, compositional samples, SceneForge
effectively addresses the scarcity of large-scale 3D-text datasets,
significantly enriching data complexity and diversity. We systematically
investigate critical design elements, such as the optimal number of objects per
scene, the proportion of compositional samples in training batches, and scene
construction strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SceneForge
delivers substantial performance gains across multiple tasks, including
zero-shot classification on ModelNet, ScanObjNN, Objaverse-LVIS, and ScanNet,
as well as few-shot part segmentation on ShapeNetPart. SceneForge's
compositional augmentations are model-agnostic, consistently improving
performance across multiple encoder architectures. Moreover, SceneForge
improves 3D visual question answering on ScanQA, generalizes robustly to
retrieval scenarios with increasing scene complexity, and showcases spatial
reasoning capabilities by adapting spatial configurations to align precisely
with textual instructions.

### [56] [ORIC: Benchmarking Object Recognition in Incongruous Context for Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15695)
*Zhaoyang Li,Zhan Ling,Yuchen Zhou,Hao Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了ORIC基准测试，用于评估大型视觉语言模型在对象与上下文关系不协调场景下的识别能力，揭示了LVLMs在对象误识别和幻觉方面的重要问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在图像描述、视觉问答等领域取得显著进展，但在对象与上下文关系不协调的场景下容易出错，存在对象误识别和幻觉问题，需要系统性地评估这些局限性。

Method: 引入ORIC基准测试，采用两种关键策略：(1) LLM引导采样识别存在但上下文不协调的对象；(2) CLIP引导采样检测可能被幻觉但实际不存在的对象，创建不协调上下文场景。

Result: 对18个LVLMs和2个开放词汇检测模型的评估结果显示存在显著的识别差距，凸显了上下文不协调带来的挑战。

Conclusion: 这项工作为LVLMs的局限性提供了重要见解，鼓励对上下文感知对象识别的进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant strides in image
caption, visual question answering, and robotics by integrating visual and
textual information. However, they remain prone to errors in incongruous
contexts, where objects appear unexpectedly or are absent when contextually
expected. This leads to two key recognition failures: object misidentification
and hallucination. To systematically examine this issue, we introduce the
Object Recognition in Incongruous Context Benchmark (ORIC), a novel benchmark
that evaluates LVLMs in scenarios where object-context relationships deviate
from expectations. ORIC employs two key strategies: (1) LLM-guided sampling,
which identifies objects that are present but contextually incongruous, and (2)
CLIP-guided sampling, which detects plausible yet nonexistent objects that are
likely to be hallucinated, thereby creating an incongruous context. Evaluating
18 LVLMs and two open-vocabulary detection models, our results reveal
significant recognition gaps, underscoring the challenges posed by contextual
incongruity. This work provides critical insights into LVLMs' limitations and
encourages further research on context-aware object recognition.

*Yuxuan Liang,Xu Li,Xiaolei Chen,Yi Zheng,Haotian Chen,Bin Li,Xiangyang Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的分词剪枝策略Pyramid Token Pruning (PTP)，通过结合自底向上的视觉显著性和自顶向下的指令引导重要性，有效减少高分辨率图像处理的计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率图像时，由于需要将图像分割成多个子图像，导致视觉分词数量急剧增加，产生指数级计算开销。

Method: PTP策略结合区域级和分词级的视觉显著性分析，以及基于文本指令的重要性评估，选择性保留关键分词。该方法受人类视觉注意力机制启发，保留视觉显著区域的分词，并根据具体任务需求筛选相关分词。

Result: 在13个多样化基准测试上的实验表明，该方法显著降低了计算开销和推理延迟，性能损失最小。

Conclusion: PTP是一种有效的训练无关分词剪枝方法，能够在不显著影响性能的前提下，大幅提升高分辨率图像处理的效率。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly advanced multimodal
understanding but still struggle with efficiently processing high-resolution
images. Recent approaches partition high-resolution images into multiple
sub-images, dramatically increasing the number of visual tokens and causing
exponential computational overhead during inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a training-free token pruning strategy, Pyramid Token
Pruning (PTP), that integrates bottom-up visual saliency at both region and
token levels with top-down instruction-guided importance. Inspired by human
visual attention mechanisms, PTP selectively retains more tokens from visually
salient regions and further leverages textual instructions to pinpoint tokens
most relevant to specific multimodal tasks. Extensive experiments across 13
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method substantially reduces
computational overhead and inference latency with minimal performance loss.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个基准数据集和基线框架，用于将多模态卫星观测转换为详细的3D云相结构，旨在改进数值天气预报中的云微物理参数化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云相剖面直接影响辐射传输和降水过程，对数值天气预报至关重要。当前需要将多模态卫星观测有效转换为3D云相结构，以改善云微物理参数化。

Method: 使用多模态卫星观测数据（地球静止卫星的可见光/热红外图像和星载激光雷达/雷达的垂直云相剖面），采用SGMAGNet模型与UNet变体和SegNet等基线架构进行比较，通过监督学习预测3D云相结构。

Result: SGMAGNet在云相重建方面表现最优，特别是在复杂的多层和边界过渡区域。定量指标显示：精确度0.922，召回率0.858，F1分数0.763，IoU 0.617，显著优于所有基线模型。

Conclusion: SGMAGNet框架能够有效从多模态卫星观测中重建3D云相结构，为改进数值天气预报中的云微物理参数化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Cloud phase profiles are critical for numerical weather prediction (NWP), as
they directly affect radiative transfer and precipitation processes. In this
study, we present a benchmark dataset and a baseline framework for transforming
multimodal satellite observations into detailed 3D cloud phase structures,
aiming toward operational cloud phase profile retrieval and future integration
with NWP systems to improve cloud microphysics parameterization. The multimodal
observations consist of (1) high--spatiotemporal--resolution, multi-band
visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery from geostationary satellites,
and (2) accurate vertical cloud phase profiles from spaceborne lidar
(CALIOP\slash CALIPSO) and radar (CPR\slash CloudSat). The dataset consists of
synchronized image--profile pairs across diverse cloud regimes, defining a
supervised learning task: given VIS/TIR patches, predict the corresponding 3D
cloud phase structure. We adopt SGMAGNet as the main model and compare it with
several baseline architectures, including UNet variants and SegNet, all
designed to capture multi-scale spatial patterns. Model performance is
evaluated using standard classification metrics, including Precision, Recall,
F1-score, and IoU. The results demonstrate that SGMAGNet achieves superior
performance in cloud phase reconstruction, particularly in complex multi-layer
and boundary transition regions. Quantitatively, SGMAGNet attains a Precision
of 0.922, Recall of 0.858, F1-score of 0.763, and an IoU of 0.617,
significantly outperforming all baselines across these key metrics.

TL;DR: 本文提出了MedForensics数据集和DSKI检测器，用于检测AI生成的医学图像，解决医学图像伪造带来的诊断欺骗、金融欺诈等风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在医学影像领域的快速发展带来了伪造医学图像的风险，现有媒体取证方法主要针对自然图像或人脸图像，无法有效捕捉AI生成医学图像的独特特征和细微伪影。

Method: 提出了DSKI检测器，包含两个核心组件：1）跨域细粒度适配器（CDFA）从空间域和噪声域提取细微伪造线索；2）医学取证检索模块（MFRM）通过少样本检索提升检测精度。

Result: 实验结果表明，DSKI在多个医学模态上显著优于现有方法和人类专家，实现了更高的检测准确率。

Conclusion: MedForensics数据集和DSKI检测器为解决AI生成医学图像的检测问题提供了有效解决方案，在医学图像取证领域具有重要意义。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI in medical imaging has introduced both
significant opportunities and serious challenges, especially the risk that fake
medical images could undermine healthcare systems. These synthetic images pose
serious risks, such as diagnostic deception, financial fraud, and
misinformation. However, research on medical forensics to counter these threats
remains limited, and there is a critical lack of comprehensive datasets
specifically tailored for this field. Additionally, existing media forensic
methods, which are primarily designed for natural or facial images, are
inadequate for capturing the distinct characteristics and subtle artifacts of
AI-generated medical images. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
\textbf{MedForensics}, a large-scale medical forensics dataset encompassing six
medical modalities and twelve state-of-the-art medical generative models. We
also propose \textbf{DSKI}, a novel \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{S}tage
\textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{I}nfusing detector that constructs a vision-language
feature space tailored for the detection of AI-generated medical images. DSKI
comprises two core components: 1) a cross-domain fine-trace adapter (CDFA) for
extracting subtle forgery clues from both spatial and noise domains during
training, and 2) a medical forensic retrieval module (MFRM) that boosts
detection accuracy through few-shot retrieval during testing. Experimental
results demonstrate that DSKI significantly outperforms both existing methods
and human experts, achieving superior accuracy across multiple medical
modalities.

TL;DR: TrueMoE提出了一种双路由混合判别专家框架，通过多个专门化判别子空间协同推理来检测合成图像，解决了现有单空间方法泛化能力差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成图像检测方法通常构建单一通用判别空间，但这种统一空间复杂且脆弱，难以泛化到未见过的生成模式。

Method: TrueMoE采用双路由机制，包含粒度感知稀疏路由器和流形感知密集路由器，将输入图像自适应分配给最相关的判别专家，这些专家按流形结构和感知粒度两个互补轴组织。

Result: 在多种生成模型上的广泛实验表明，TrueMoE实现了优异的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过多专家协作的方法，TrueMoE能够更有效地捕捉多样化的伪造线索，显著提升合成图像检测性能。

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models has made synthetic image detection an
increasingly critical task. Most existing approaches attempt to construct a
single, universal discriminative space to separate real from fake content.
However, such unified spaces tend to be complex and brittle, often struggling
to generalize to unseen generative patterns. In this work, we propose TrueMoE,
a novel dual-routing Mixture-of-Discriminative-Experts framework that
reformulates the detection task as a collaborative inference across multiple
specialized and lightweight discriminative subspaces. At the core of TrueMoE is
a Discriminative Expert Array (DEA) organized along complementary axes of
manifold structure and perceptual granularity, enabling diverse forgery cues to
be captured across subspaces. A dual-routing mechanism, comprising a
granularity-aware sparse router and a manifold-aware dense router, adaptively
assigns input images to the most relevant experts. Extensive experiments across
a wide spectrum of generative models demonstrate that TrueMoE achieves superior
generalization and robustness.

Conclusion: 研究结果深化了对感受野响应关系的理解，可用于设计高效的计算方案和构建生物视觉中简单细胞计算的理论模型。

Abstract: Because of the variabilities of real-world image structures under the natural
image transformations that arise when observing similar objects or
spatio-temporal events under different viewing conditions, the receptive field
responses computed in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy may be
strongly influenced by such geometric image transformations. One way of
handling this variability is by basing the vision system on covariant receptive
field families, which expand the receptive field shapes over the degrees of
freedom in the image transformations.
  This paper addresses the problem of deriving relationships between spatial
and spatio-temporal receptive field responses obtained for different values of
the shape parameters in the resulting multi-parameter families of receptive
fields. For this purpose, we derive both (i) infinitesimal relationships,
roughly corresponding to a combination of notions from semi-groups and Lie
groups, as well as (ii) macroscopic cascade smoothing properties, which
describe how receptive field responses at coarser spatial and temporal scales
can be computed by applying smaller support incremental filters to the output
from corresponding receptive fields at finer spatial and temporal scales,
structurally related to the notion of Lie algebras, although with directional
preferences.
  The presented results provide (i) a deeper understanding of the relationships
between spatial and spatio-temporal receptive field responses for different
values of the filter parameters, which can be used for both (ii) designing more
efficient schemes for computing receptive field responses over populations of
multi-parameter families of receptive fields, as well as (iii)~formulating
idealized theoretical models of the computations of simple cells in biological
vision.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如几何算法和基于Mask R-CNN的深度学习方法在处理点云数据时面临噪声干扰、泛化能力有限和几何细节丢失等问题，需要一种更准确、鲁棒的平面图重建方法。

Method: 使用基于网格的滤波、自适应分辨率投影和图像增强技术创建鲁棒的俯视密度图，利用SAM的零样本学习进行精确的房间分割，通过自适应提示点和多阶段滤波生成房间掩码，最后结合掩码和点云分析进行轮廓提取和正则化。

Conclusion: FloorSAM框架通过结合点云密度图和SAM模型，实现了更准确、鲁棒的建筑平面图重建，能够恢复房间拓扑关系，为室内导航、BIM和精确测量提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing building floor plans from point cloud data is key for indoor
navigation, BIM, and precise measurements. Traditional methods like geometric
algorithms and Mask R-CNN-based deep learning often face issues with noise,
limited generalization, and loss of geometric details. We propose FloorSAM, a
framework that integrates point cloud density maps with the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) for accurate floor plan reconstruction from LiDAR data. Using
grid-based filtering, adaptive resolution projection, and image enhancement, we
create robust top-down density maps. FloorSAM uses SAM's zero-shot learning for
precise room segmentation, improving reconstruction across diverse layouts.
Room masks are generated via adaptive prompt points and multistage filtering,
followed by joint mask and point cloud analysis for contour extraction and
regularization. This produces accurate floor plans and recovers room
topological relationships. Tests on Giblayout and ISPRS datasets show better
accuracy, recall, and robustness than traditional methods, especially in noisy
and complex settings. Code and materials: github.com/Silentbarber/FloorSAM.

Motivation: 现有的自监督学习模型虽然模拟了婴儿的视觉体验，但忽略了人类视觉的视网膜中央凹特性（中心高分辨率、周边低分辨率），本文旨在研究这种视觉特性对物体表征学习的影响。

Method: 使用两个包含人类与物体互动的自我中心视角视频数据集，应用人类视网膜中央凹和皮层放大模型对输入进行修改，使视觉内容在周边区域变得模糊，然后用这些序列训练两个基于时间学习目标的生物启发自监督学习模型。

Result: 建模视网膜中央凹视觉特性能够提高在这种设置下学习的物体表征质量，分析表明这种改进源于使物体显得更大，并在中心与周边视觉信息之间实现更好的权衡。

Conclusion: 这项工作使人类视觉表征学习模型更加真实和高效，为构建更符合人类视觉特性的学习模型迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Recent self-supervised learning models simulate the development of semantic
object representations by training on visual experience similar to that of
toddlers. However, these models ignore the foveated nature of human vision with
high/low resolution in the center/periphery of the visual field. Here, we
investigate the role of this varying resolution in the development of object
representations. We leverage two datasets of egocentric videos that capture the
visual experience of humans during interactions with objects. We apply models
of human foveation and cortical magnification to modify these inputs, such that
the visual content becomes less distinct towards the periphery. The resulting
sequences are used to train two bio-inspired self-supervised learning models
that implement a time-based learning objective. Our results show that modeling
aspects of foveated vision improves the quality of the learned object
representations in this setting. Our analysis suggests that this improvement
comes from making objects appear bigger and inducing a better trade-off between
central and peripheral visual information. Overall, this work takes a step
towards making models of humans' learning of visual representations more
realistic and performant.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有COD基准数据集仅支持RGB图像，缺乏对多光谱方法的支持，这阻碍了该领域的发展。多光谱图像提供丰富的光谱信息，有望增强前景-背景区分能力。

Method: 构建MCOD数据集，包含三个关键优势：(i)全面的挑战属性，如小物体尺寸和极端光照条件；(ii)多样化的真实世界场景；(iii)高质量的像素级人工标注。在MCOD上对11种代表性COD方法进行基准测试。

Result: 基准测试显示由于任务难度增加，所有方法性能均出现一致下降。但集成多光谱模态显著缓解了这种性能下降，突出了光谱信息在增强检测鲁棒性方面的价值。

Conclusion: MCOD为多光谱伪装目标检测的未来研究提供了坚实基础，多光谱信息能有效提升在挑战性条件下的检测性能。

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) aims to identify objects that blend
seamlessly into natural scenes. Although RGB-based methods have advanced, their
performance remains limited under challenging conditions. Multispectral
imagery, providing rich spectral information, offers a promising alternative
for enhanced foreground-background discrimination. However, existing COD
benchmark datasets are exclusively RGB-based, lacking essential support for
multispectral approaches, which has impeded progress in this area. To address
this gap, we introduce MCOD, the first challenging benchmark dataset
specifically designed for multispectral camouflaged object detection. MCOD
features three key advantages: (i) Comprehensive challenge attributes: It
captures real-world difficulties such as small object sizes and extreme
lighting conditions commonly encountered in COD tasks. (ii) Diverse real-world
scenarios: The dataset spans a wide range of natural environments to better
reflect practical applications. (iii) High-quality pixel-level annotations:
Each image is manually annotated with precise object masks and corresponding
challenge attribute labels. We benchmark eleven representative COD methods on
MCOD, observing a consistent performance drop due to increased task difficulty.
Notably, integrating multispectral modalities substantially alleviates this
degradation, highlighting the value of spectral information in enhancing
detection robustness. We anticipate MCOD will provide a strong foundation for
future research in multispectral camouflaged object detection. The dataset is
publicly accessible at https://github.com/yl2900260-bit/MCOD.

Conclusion: PlantCLEF 2024挑战赛为植物物种识别提供了标准化的评估框架，展示了AI在生态研究中的潜力。

Abstract: Plot images are essential for ecological studies, enabling standardized
sampling, biodiversity assessment, long-term monitoring and remote, large-scale
surveys. Plot images are typically fifty centimetres or one square meter in
size, and botanists meticulously identify all the species found there. The
integration of AI could significantly improve the efficiency of specialists,
helping them to extend the scope and coverage of ecological studies. To
evaluate advances in this regard, the PlantCLEF 2024 challenge leverages a new
test set of thousands of multi-label images annotated by experts and covering
over 800 species. In addition, it provides a large training set of 1.7 million
individual plant images as well as state-of-the-art vision transformer models
pre-trained on this data. The task is evaluated as a (weakly-labeled)
multi-label classification task where the aim is to predict all the plant
species present on a high-resolution plot image (using the single-label
training data). In this paper, we provide an detailed description of the data,
the evaluation methodology, the methods and models employed by the participants
and the results achieved.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLM3D是一个新的文本到3D生成框架，通过将大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）集成到SDS流程中，解决了现有SDS方法在语义对齐和3D空间一致性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SDS方法存在两个主要问题：(1)依赖CLIP式文本编码器导致语义对齐粗糙，难以处理细粒度提示；(2)2D扩散先验缺乏明确的3D空间约束，导致几何不一致和多物体场景中的关系不准确。

Method: 提出VLM3D框架，将VLMs作为可微分的语义和空间先验集成到SDS流程中。利用Qwen2.5-VL模型，通过丰富的语言基础监督实现细粒度提示对齐，并利用其固有的视觉语言建模能力增强3D一致性。

Result: 在GPTeval3D基准测试中，VLM3D在语义保真度、几何一致性和空间正确性方面显著优于现有的SDS方法，在多样化物体和复杂场景中表现出色。

Conclusion: VLM3D通过集成VLMs作为语义和空间先验，有效解决了SDS方法的局限性，在文本到3D生成任务中实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) enables high-quality text-to-3D generation
by supervising 3D models through the denoising of multi-view 2D renderings,
using a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model to align with the input prompt
and ensure 3D consistency. However, existing SDS-based methods face two
fundamental limitations: (1) their reliance on CLIP-style text encoders leads
to coarse semantic alignment and struggles with fine-grained prompts; and (2)
2D diffusion priors lack explicit 3D spatial constraints, resulting in
geometric inconsistencies and inaccurate object relationships in multi-object
scenes. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a novel text-to-3D
generation framework that integrates large vision-language models (VLMs) into
the SDS pipeline as differentiable semantic and spatial priors. Unlike standard
text-to-image diffusion priors, VLMs leverage rich language-grounded
supervision that enables fine-grained prompt alignment. Moreover, their
inherent vision language modeling provides strong spatial understanding, which
significantly enhances 3D consistency for single-object generation and improves
relational reasoning in multi-object scenes. We instantiate VLM3D based on the
open-source Qwen2.5-VL model and evaluate it on the GPTeval3D benchmark.
Experiments across diverse objects and complex scenes show that VLM3D
significantly outperforms prior SDS-based methods in semantic fidelity,
geometric coherence, and spatial correctness.

TL;DR: 提出了SCOPE框架，通过将SAM2的ViT编码器集成到Cutie中并添加运动预测模块，结合三者的优势在视频对象分割任务中取得第三名


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Cutie和SAM2各有局限性，Cutie在特征容量方面不足，SAM2在时序建模方面较弱，需要结合两者的互补优势

Method: 用SAM2的ViT编码器替换Cutie的编码器，引入运动预测模块增强时序稳定性，并采用Cutie、SAM2和本变体的集成策略

Result: 在第七届LSVOS挑战赛的MOSEv2赛道中获得第三名

Conclusion: 证明了丰富特征表示和运动预测对于鲁棒视频对象分割的有效性

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) is a challenging task with wide applications
such as video editing and autonomous driving. While Cutie provides strong
query-based segmentation and SAM2 offers enriched representations via a
pretrained ViT encoder, each has limitations in feature capacity and temporal
modeling. In this report, we propose a framework that integrates their
complementary strengths by replacing the encoder of Cutie with the ViT encoder
of SAM2 and introducing a motion prediction module for temporal stability. We
further adopt an ensemble strategy combining Cutie, SAM2, and our variant,
achieving 3rd place in the MOSEv2 track of the 7th LSVOS Challenge. We refer to
our final model as SCOPE (SAM2-CUTIE Object Prediction Ensemble). This
demonstrates the effectiveness of enriched feature representation and motion
prediction for robust video object segmentation. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegReg是一个分割驱动的图像配准框架，通过利用区域特定的变形模式实现解剖学自适应正则化，解决了传统方法中全局均匀平滑约束无法适应复杂解剖运动的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法在图像配准中常使用全局均匀平滑约束，无法适应解剖运动中复杂且区域变化的变形特征。

Method: SegReg首先通过分割将输入图像分解为解剖一致子区域，然后由同一配准主干处理这些局部域以计算优化的部分变形场，最后将这些部分变形场整合为全局变形场。

Result: 使用真实分割时，SegReg在关键解剖结构上达到98.23%的Dice分数；在三个临床配准场景（心脏、腹部和肺部图像）中，即使使用自动分割也优于现有方法2-12%。

Conclusion: SegReg展示了配准精度与分割质量之间的近线性依赖关系，将配准挑战转化为分割问题。

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized image registration by its ability to handle
diverse tasks while achieving significant speed advantages over conventional
approaches. Current approaches, however, often employ globally uniform
smoothness constraints that fail to accommodate the complex, regionally varying
deformations characteristic of anatomical motion. To address this limitation,
we propose SegReg, a Segmentation-driven Registration framework that implements
anatomically adaptive regularization by exploiting region-specific deformation
patterns. Our SegReg first decomposes input moving and fixed images into
anatomically coherent subregions through segmentation. These localized domains
are then processed by the same registration backbone to compute optimized
partial deformation fields, which are subsequently integrated into a global
deformation field. SegReg achieves near-perfect structural alignment (98.23%
Dice on critical anatomies) using ground-truth segmentation, and outperforms
existing methods by 2-12% across three clinical registration scenarios
(cardiac, abdominal, and lung images) even with automatic segmentation. Our
SegReg demonstrates a near-linear dependence of registration accuracy on
segmentation quality, transforming the registration challenge into a
segmentation problem. The source code will be released upon manuscript
acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出CBPNet框架解决持续学习中因使用冻结预训练模型导致的塑性损失问题，通过在训练过程中自适应重新初始化未充分利用的参数来恢复模型学习活力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备需要实时响应动态环境的持续学习方法，但现有基于冻结预训练模型和提示的方法存在塑性损失问题，即模型学习新知识能力下降

Method: 提出Continual Backpropagation Prompt Network (CBPNet)，集成高效的CBP块，通过自适应重新初始化未充分利用的参数来对抗塑性衰减

Result: 在Split CIFAR-100上比强基线提高平均准确率超过1%，在更具挑战性的Split ImageNet-R上达到69.41%的SOTA准确率，仅需训练不到主干网络0.2%的额外参数

Conclusion: CBPNet是一种有效且参数高效的框架，能够显著提升持续学习性能，特别适合边缘设备应用

Abstract: To meet the demands of applications like robotics and autonomous driving that
require real-time responses to dynamic environments, efficient continual
learning methods suitable for edge devices have attracted increasing attention.
In this transition, using frozen pretrained models with prompts has become a
mainstream strategy to combat catastrophic forgetting. However, this approach
introduces a new critical bottleneck: plasticity loss, where the model's
ability to learn new knowledge diminishes due to the frozen backbone and the
limited capacity of prompt parameters. We argue that the reduction in
plasticity stems from a lack of update vitality in underutilized parameters
during the training process. To this end, we propose the Continual
Backpropagation Prompt Network (CBPNet), an effective and parameter efficient
framework designed to restore the model's learning vitality. We innovatively
integrate an Efficient CBP Block that counteracts plasticity decay by
adaptively reinitializing these underutilized parameters. Experimental results
on edge devices demonstrate CBPNet's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.
On Split CIFAR-100, it improves average accuracy by over 1% against a strong
baseline, and on the more challenging Split ImageNet-R, it achieves a state of
the art accuracy of 69.41%. This is accomplished by training additional
parameters that constitute less than 0.2% of the backbone's size, validating
our approach.

Motivation: 现有遥感语义变化检测数据集存在类别有限、变化类型不足、类别定义不够细粒度的问题，同时现有方法对变化信息的利用不充分，通常将其作为后处理步骤，限制了模型性能的进一步提升。

Method: 提出了前景-背景协同引导的SCD方法（FoBa），利用关注感兴趣区域的前景和富含上下文信息的背景协同引导模型，并引入了门控交互融合模块和一致性损失来增强双时相交互和空间一致性。

Result: 在三个数据集（SECOND、JL1和提出的LevirSCD）上的实验表明，FoBa相比当前SOTA方法在SeK指标上分别提升了1.48%、3.61%和2.81%。

Conclusion: LevirSCD数据集和FoBa方法有效解决了遥感语义变化检测中的数据和方法限制，为实际应用提供了更好的支持，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress achieved in remote sensing semantic change
detection (SCD), two major challenges remain. At the data level, existing SCD
datasets suffer from limited change categories, insufficient change types, and
a lack of fine-grained class definitions, making them inadequate to fully
support practical applications. At the methodological level, most current
approaches underutilize change information, typically treating it as a
post-processing step to enhance spatial consistency, which constrains further
improvements in model performance. To address these issues, we construct a new
benchmark for remote sensing SCD, LevirSCD. Focused on the Beijing area, the
dataset covers 16 change categories and 210 specific change types, with more
fine-grained class definitions (e.g., roads are divided into unpaved and paved
roads). Furthermore, we propose a foreground-background co-guided SCD (FoBa)
method, which leverages foregrounds that focus on regions of interest and
backgrounds enriched with contextual information to guide the model
collaboratively, thereby alleviating semantic ambiguity while enhancing its
ability to detect subtle changes. Considering the requirements of bi-temporal
interaction and spatial consistency in SCD, we introduce a Gated Interaction
Fusion (GIF) module along with a simple consistency loss to further enhance the
model's detection performance. Extensive experiments on three datasets (SECOND,
JL1, and the proposed LevirSCD) demonstrate that FoBa achieves competitive
results compared to current SOTA methods, with improvements of 1.48%, 3.61%,
and 2.81% in the SeK metric, respectively. Our code and dataset are available

Motivation: 无监督学习中的泛化能力研究较少，现有UDG方法依赖域标签，但在实际场景中域标签往往不可得。本文旨在解决这一限制。

Method: 提出MS-UDG方法，基于信息论学习最小充分语义表示：使用InfoNCE目标实现充分性，通过语义-变化解纠缠损失和重构机制促进最小性。

Result: 在流行的无监督域泛化基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，显著优于现有的SSL和UDG方法。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了无需类别或域标签即可有效提升无监督学习的泛化能力，为实际应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The generalization ability of deep learning has been extensively studied in
supervised settings, yet it remains less explored in unsupervised scenarios.
Recently, the Unsupervised Domain Generalization (UDG) task has been proposed
to enhance the generalization of models trained with prevalent unsupervised
learning techniques, such as Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). UDG confronts the
challenge of distinguishing semantics from variations without category labels.
Although some recent methods have employed domain labels to tackle this issue,
such domain labels are often unavailable in real-world contexts. In this paper,
we address these limitations by formalizing UDG as the task of learning a
Minimal Sufficient Semantic Representation: a representation that (i) preserves
all semantic information shared across augmented views (sufficiency), and (ii)
maximally removes information irrelevant to semantics (minimality). We
theoretically ground these objectives from the perspective of information
theory, demonstrating that optimizing representations to achieve sufficiency
and minimality directly reduces out-of-distribution risk. Practically, we
implement this optimization through Minimal-Sufficient UDG (MS-UDG), a
learnable model by integrating (a) an InfoNCE-based objective to achieve
sufficiency; (b) two complementary components to promote minimality: a novel
semantic-variation disentanglement loss and a reconstruction-based mechanism
for capturing adequate variation. Empirically, MS-UDG sets a new
state-of-the-art on popular unsupervised domain-generalization benchmarks,
consistently outperforming existing SSL and UDG methods, without category or
domain labels during representation learning.

Motivation: SAM在自然图像领域表现出色，但在遥感数据上泛化能力不足，面临复杂地形、多尺度对象和时序动态等独特挑战。

Method: TASAM在SAM基础上集成了三个轻量级模块：地形感知适配器（注入高程先验）、时序提示生成器（捕捉土地覆盖变化）和多尺度融合策略（增强细粒度对象划分）。

Result: 在不重新训练SAM主干的情况下，TASAM在LoveDA、iSAID和WHU-CD三个遥感基准测试中显著优于零样本SAM和任务特定模型，且计算开销极小。

Conclusion: 研究证明了领域自适应增强对基础模型的价值，为更稳健的地理空间分割提供了可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive zero-shot
segmentation capabilities across natural image domains, but it struggles to
generalize to the unique challenges of remote sensing data, such as complex
terrain, multi-scale objects, and temporal dynamics. In this paper, we
introduce TASAM, a terrain and temporally-aware extension of SAM designed
specifically for high-resolution remote sensing image segmentation. TASAM
integrates three lightweight yet effective modules: a terrain-aware adapter
that injects elevation priors, a temporal prompt generator that captures
land-cover changes over time, and a multi-scale fusion strategy that enhances
fine-grained object delineation. Without retraining the SAM backbone, our
approach achieves substantial performance gains across three remote sensing
benchmarks-LoveDA, iSAID, and WHU-CD-outperforming both zero-shot SAM and
task-specific models with minimal computational overhead. Our results highlight
the value of domain-adaptive augmentation for foundation models and offer a
scalable path toward more robust geospatial segmentation.

Motivation: 当前最先进的视频理解方法面临两个关键挑战：(1) 处理密集视频内容中每一帧的计算不可行性；(2) 通过朴素均匀采样策略难以识别语义重要帧。

Method: 提出可微分的关键帧选择机制，通过三阶段过程系统识别语义转折点。具体包括：TAD模块利用变化评分、转折点检测和优先蒸馏选择最具信息量的帧；KF-GRPO模块实现对比学习范式，通过显著性增强奖励机制激励模型利用帧内容和时间关系。

Conclusion: ChronoForge-RL框架有效解决了视频理解中的计算效率和语义帧选择问题，在保持时间信息的同时显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art video understanding methods typically struggle with
two critical challenges: (1) the computational infeasibility of processing
every frame in dense video content and (2) the difficulty in identifying
semantically significant frames through naive uniform sampling strategies. In
this paper, we propose a novel video understanding framework, called
ChronoForge-RL, which combines Temporal Apex Distillation (TAD) and
KeyFrame-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (KF-GRPO) to tackle these
issues. Concretely, we introduce a differentiable keyframe selection mechanism
that systematically identifies semantic inflection points through a three-stage
process to enhance computational efficiency while preserving temporal
information. Then, two particular modules are proposed to enable effective
temporal reasoning: Firstly, TAD leverages variation scoring, inflection
detection, and prioritized distillation to select the most informative frames.
Secondly, we introduce KF-GRPO which implements a contrastive learning paradigm
with a saliency-enhanced reward mechanism that explicitly incentivizes models
to leverage both frame content and temporal relationships. Finally, our
proposed ChronoForge-RL achieves 69.1% on VideoMME and 52.7% on LVBench
compared to baseline methods, clearly surpassing previous approaches while
enabling our 7B parameter model to achieve performance comparable to 72B
parameter alternatives.

Motivation: 文本到图像模型存在显著的'品牌偏见'，即从通用提示词中倾向于生成包含主导商业品牌的内容，这带来了伦理和法律风险。

Method: 使用轻量级检测器识别品牌内容，然后通过视觉语言模型生成风格迥异的替代方案，并引入品牌中立性评分来量化问题。

Result: 在领先的文本到图像模型上进行广泛实验，结果显示CIDER显著减少了显性和隐性偏见，同时保持了图像质量和美学吸引力。

Conclusion: 该工作为生成更原创和公平的内容提供了实用解决方案，有助于开发可信赖的生成式AI。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models exhibit a significant yet under-explored "brand
bias", a tendency to generate contents featuring dominant commercial brands
from generic prompts, posing ethical and legal risks. We propose CIDER, a
novel, model-agnostic framework to mitigate bias at inference-time through
prompt refinement to avoid costly retraining. CIDER uses a lightweight detector
to identify branded content and a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate
stylistically divergent alternatives. We introduce the Brand Neutrality Score
(BNS) to quantify this issue and perform extensive experiments on leading T2I
models. Results show CIDER significantly reduces both explicit and implicit
biases while maintaining image quality and aesthetic appeal. Our work offers a
practical solution for more original and equitable content, contributing to the
development of trustworthy generative AI.

Conclusion: 该方法证明了数据不确定性并非与任务损失的具体值相关，而是与任务损失的上界密切相关，提供了一种任务无关的通用不确定性估计方法。

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is at the core of Active Learning (AL). Most existing
methods resort to complex auxiliary models and advanced training fashions to
estimate uncertainty for unlabeled data. These models need special design and
hence are difficult to train especially for domain tasks, such as Cryo-Electron
Tomography (cryo-ET) classification in computational biology. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel method using knowledge transfer to boost
uncertainty estimation in AL. Specifically, we exploit the teacher-student mode
where the teacher is the task model in AL and the student is an auxiliary model
that learns from the teacher. We train the two models simultaneously in each AL
cycle and adopt a certain distance between the model outputs to measure
uncertainty for unlabeled data. The student model is task-agnostic and does not
rely on special training fashions (e.g. adversarial), making our method
suitable for various tasks. More importantly, we demonstrate that data
uncertainty is not tied to concrete value of task loss but closely related to
the upper-bound of task loss. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the
proposed method on classical computer vision tasks and cryo-ET challenges. The
results demonstrate its efficacy and efficiency.

Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的土地覆盖制图方法在使用稀疏现场数据时会产生碎片化和噪声预测，而基于对象的分类方法虽然能通过设置最小制图单元来解决这个问题，但在深度学习中仍未被充分探索。

Method: 提出LC-Slab框架，支持两种基于对象的聚合方法：输入级聚合（使用图神经网络）和输出级聚合（对语义分割模型结果进行后处理），并整合预训练网络特征提升小数据集性能。

Result: 在Sentinel-2年度合成数据和稀疏LUCAS标签上的评估显示，基于对象的方法在匹配或超越常见像素级模型精度的同时，能产生更连贯的地图。输入级聚合在小数据集上更稳健，输出级聚合在数据充足时表现最佳。

Conclusion: LC-SLab框架证明了基于对象的深度学习方法在大规模土地覆盖分类中的实用价值，多个配置优于现有土地覆盖产品，为解决稀疏监督下的制图碎片化问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large-scale land cover maps generated using deep learning play a critical
role across a wide range of Earth science applications. Open in-situ datasets
from principled land cover surveys offer a scalable alternative to manual
annotation for training such models. However, their sparse spatial coverage
often leads to fragmented and noisy predictions when used with existing deep
learning-based land cover mapping approaches. A promising direction to address
this issue is object-based classification, which assigns labels to semantically
coherent image regions rather than individual pixels, thereby imposing a
minimum mapping unit. Despite this potential, object-based methods remain
underexplored in deep learning-based land cover mapping pipelines, especially
in the context of medium-resolution imagery and sparse supervision. To address
this gap, we propose LC-SLab, the first deep learning framework for
systematically exploring object-based deep learning methods for large-scale
land cover classification under sparse supervision. LC-SLab supports both
input-level aggregation via graph neural networks, and output-level aggregation
by postprocessing results from established semantic segmentation models.
Additionally, we incorporate features from a large pre-trained network to
improve performance on small datasets. We evaluate the framework on annual
Sentinel-2 composites with sparse LUCAS labels, focusing on the tradeoff
between accuracy and fragmentation, as well as sensitivity to dataset size. Our
results show that object-based methods can match or exceed the accuracy of
common pixel-wise models while producing substantially more coherent maps.
Input-level aggregation proves more robust on smaller datasets, whereas
output-level aggregation performs best with more data. Several configurations
of LC-SLab also outperform existing land cover products, highlighting the
framework's practical utility.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to locate objects in 3D scenes based on text
prompts, which is essential for applications such as robotics. However,
existing 3DVG methods encounter two main challenges: first, they struggle to
handle the implicit representation of spatial textures in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), making per-scene training indispensable; second, they typically require
larges amounts of labeled data for effective training. To this end, we propose
\underline{G}rounding via \underline{V}iew \underline{R}etrieval (GVR), a novel
zero-shot visual grounding framework for 3DGS to transform 3DVG as a 2D
retrieval task that leverages object-level view retrieval to collect grounding
clues from multiple views, which not only avoids the costly process of 3D
annotation, but also eliminates the need for per-scene training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art visual
grounding performance while avoiding per-scene training, providing a solid
foundation for zero-shot 3DVG research. Video demos can be found in

ENSAM combines a SegResNet-based encoder with a prompt encoder and mask decoder
in a U-Net-style architecture, using latent cross-attention, relative
positional encoding, normalized attention, and the Muon optimizer for training.
ENSAM is designed to achieve good performance under limited data and
computational budgets, and is trained from scratch on under 5,000 volumes from
multiple modalities (CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, microscopy) on a single 32 GB
GPU in 6 hours. As part of the CVPR 2025 Foundation Models for Interactive 3D
Biomedical Image Segmentation Challenge, ENSAM was evaluated on hidden test set
with multimodal 3D medical images, obtaining a DSC AUC of 2.404, NSD AUC of
2.266, final DSC of 0.627, and final NSD of 0.597, outperforming two previously
published baseline models (VISTA3D, SAM-Med3D) and matching the third (SegVol),
surpassing its performance in final DSC but trailing behind in the other three
metrics. In the coreset track of the challenge, ENSAM ranks 5th of 10 overall
and best among the approaches not utilizing pretrained weights. Ablation
studies confirm that our use of relative positional encodings and the Muon
optimizer each substantially speed up convergence and improve segmentation
quality.

TL;DR: CrossI2P是一个自监督框架，通过统一跨模态学习和两阶段配准来解决图像到点云配准的挑战，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决2D图像和3D点云之间的语义-几何差距问题，以及现有方法容易陷入局部最优的局限性。

Method: 采用双路径对比学习构建几何-语义融合嵌入空间，使用粗到精的配准范式（全局超点-超像素对应和几何约束的点级细化），并利用动态训练机制平衡损失。

Result: 在KITTI Odometry基准测试中性能提升23.7%，在nuScenes上提升37.9%，显著提高了准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CrossI2P框架有效解决了跨模态配准问题，为自主系统的鲁棒感知提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Bridging 2D and 3D sensor modalities is critical for robust perception in
autonomous systems. However, image-to-point cloud (I2P) registration remains
challenging due to the semantic-geometric gap between texture-rich but
depth-ambiguous images and sparse yet metrically precise point clouds, as well
as the tendency of existing methods to converge to local optima. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce CrossI2P, a self-supervised framework that
unifies cross-modal learning and two-stage registration in a single end-to-end
pipeline. First, we learn a geometric-semantic fused embedding space via
dual-path contrastive learning, enabling annotation-free, bidirectional
alignment of 2D textures and 3D structures. Second, we adopt a coarse-to-fine
registration paradigm: a global stage establishes superpoint-superpixel
correspondences through joint intra-modal context and cross-modal interaction
modeling, followed by a geometry-constrained point-level refinement for precise
registration. Third, we employ a dynamic training mechanism with gradient
normalization to balance losses for feature alignment, correspondence
refinement, and pose estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
CrossI2P outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 23.7% on the KITTI Odometry
benchmark and by 37.9% on nuScenes, significantly improving both accuracy and
robustness.

*Xiaosheng Long,Hanyu Wang,Zhentao Song,Kun Luo,Hongde Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RACap是一个基于检索增强的关系感知图像描述模型，通过挖掘检索描述中的结构化关系语义和识别图像中的异构对象，解决了现有方法在关系建模方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前检索增强图像描述方法在关系建模方面存在两个挑战：(1)语义提示表示过于粗粒度，无法捕捉细粒度关系；(2)缺乏对图像对象及其语义关系的显式建模。

Method: 提出RACap模型，不仅从检索描述中挖掘结构化关系语义，还识别图像中的异构对象，有效检索包含异构视觉信息的结构化关系特征来增强语义一致性和关系表达能力。

Result: 实验结果显示，RACap仅需1080万可训练参数，相比之前的轻量级描述模型取得了更优越的性能。

Conclusion: RACap通过关系感知的检索增强方法，有效解决了图像描述中关系建模的挑战，在保持模型轻量化的同时提升了性能。

Abstract: Recent retrieval-augmented image captioning methods incorporate external
knowledge to compensate for the limitations in comprehending complex scenes.
However, current approaches face challenges in relation modeling: (1) the
representation of semantic prompts is too coarse-grained to capture
fine-grained relationships; (2) these methods lack explicit modeling of image
objects and their semantic relationships. To address these limitations, we
propose RACap, a relation-aware retrieval-augmented model for image captioning,
which not only mines structured relation semantics from retrieval captions, but
also identifies heterogeneous objects from the image. RACap effectively
retrieves structured relation features that contain heterogeneous visual
information to enhance the semantic consistency and relational expressiveness.
Experimental results show that RACap, with only 10.8M trainable parameters,
achieves superior performance compared to previous lightweight captioning
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个将SAM2视觉基础模型适配到3D点云分割的range-view框架，通过架构修改优化SAM2在LiDAR距离图像上的表现，在保持2D流水线速度优势的同时获得有竞争力的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有体素和点云方法计算成本高且实时性有限，而range-view方法可以利用成熟的2D分割技术实现快速准确预测。受视觉基础模型在分割任务中的进展启发，研究SAM2是否可以作为LiDAR点云分割的强大骨干网络。

Method: 提出range-view框架，将SAM2适配到3D分割，结合高效2D特征提取和标准投影/反投影操作。对编码器进行三项架构修改：(1)强调LiDAR距离图像水平空间依赖性的新模块；(2)针对球面投影几何特性定制的配置；(3)捕捉range-view伪图像独特空间模式和间断性的适配机制。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI数据集上实现了有竞争力的性能，同时受益于2D流水线的速度、可扩展性和部署简便性。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了视觉基础模型作为3D感知通用骨干网络的可行性，为统一的、基础模型驱动的LiDAR分割开辟了道路，使用VFMs的range-view分割方法取得了有希望的结果。

Abstract: Point cloud segmentation is central to autonomous driving and 3D scene
understanding. While voxel- and point-based methods dominate recent research
due to their compatibility with deep architectures and ability to capture
fine-grained geometry, they often incur high computational cost, irregular
memory access, and limited real-time efficiency. In contrast, range-view
methods, though relatively underexplored - can leverage mature 2D semantic
segmentation techniques for fast and accurate predictions. Motivated by the
rapid progress in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for captioning, zero-shot
recognition, and multimodal tasks, we investigate whether SAM2, the current
state-of-the-art VFM for segmentation tasks, can serve as a strong backbone for
LiDAR point cloud segmentation in the range view. We present , to our
knowledge, the first range-view framework that adapts SAM2 to 3D segmentation,
coupling efficient 2D feature extraction with standard
projection/back-projection to operate on point clouds. To optimize SAM2 for
range-view representations, we implement several architectural modifications to
the encoder: (1) a novel module that emphasizes horizontal spatial dependencies
inherent in LiDAR range images, (2) a customized configuration of tailored to
the geometric properties of spherical projections, and (3) an adapted mechanism
in the encoder backbone specifically designed to capture the unique spatial
patterns and discontinuities present in range-view pseudo-images. Our approach
achieves competitive performance on SemanticKITTI while benefiting from the
speed, scalability, and deployment simplicity of 2D-centric pipelines. This
work highlights the viability of VFMs as general-purpose backbones for 3D
perception and opens a path toward unified, foundation-model-driven LiDAR
segmentation. Results lets us conclude that range-view segmentation methods
using VFMs leads to promising results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了GREAT框架，通过三个注意力模块（空间注意力、匹配注意力、体积注意力）为现有迭代立体匹配方法注入全局上下文信息，解决遮挡、纹理缺失等困难区域的匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有迭代立体匹配方法（如RAFT-Stereo、IGEV-Stereo）在遮挡、纹理缺失或重复纹理等困难区域表现不佳，主要原因是缺乏全局上下文和几何信息来指导迭代优化。

Method: 提出GREAT框架，包含三个注意力模块：空间注意力（SA）捕捉空间维度的全局上下文，匹配注意力（MA）沿极线提取全局上下文，体积注意力（VA）与SA和MA协同构建更鲁棒的成本体积。该框架可集成到多种迭代立体匹配方法中。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得领先成绩：GREAT-IGEV在Scene Flow测试集、KITTI 2015和ETH3D排行榜上排名第一，在Middlebury基准上排名第二。

Conclusion: GREAT框架通过引入全局上下文调节机制，显著提升了迭代立体匹配方法在困难区域的性能，具有很好的通用性和有效性。

Abstract: Stereo matching achieves significant progress with iterative algorithms like
RAFT-Stereo and IGEV-Stereo. However, these methods struggle in ill-posed
regions with occlusions, textureless, or repetitive patterns, due to a lack of
global context and geometric information for effective iterative refinement. To
enable the existing iterative approaches to incorporate global context, we
propose the Global Regulation and Excitation via Attention Tuning (GREAT)
framework which encompasses three attention modules. Specifically, Spatial
Attention (SA) captures the global context within the spatial dimension,
Matching Attention (MA) extracts global context along epipolar lines, and
Volume Attention (VA) works in conjunction with SA and MA to construct a more
robust cost-volume excited by global context and geometric details. To verify
the universality and effectiveness of this framework, we integrate it into
several representative iterative stereo-matching methods and validate it
through extensive experiments, collectively denoted as GREAT-Stereo. This
framework demonstrates superior performance in challenging ill-posed regions.
Applied to IGEV-Stereo, among all published methods, our GREAT-IGEV ranks first
on the Scene Flow test set, KITTI 2015, and ETH3D leaderboards, and achieves
second on the Middlebury benchmark. Code is available at
https://github.com/JarvisLee0423/GREAT-Stereo.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 深度反馈模型（DFMs）是一种新型的状态神经网络，通过结合自下而上的输入和随时间变化的高层表示，引入反馈机制，使静态架构具有动态特性，能够迭代优化内部状态并模拟生物决策过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的前馈神经网络缺乏动态反馈机制，限制了其在噪声环境和小数据场景下的性能。DFMs旨在通过引入生物启发的反馈机制，提升模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 将反馈过程建模为微分方程，通过循环神经网络求解，并使用指数衰减进行稳定化以确保收敛。在物体识别和分割任务中评估DFMs的噪声鲁棒性和小数据泛化能力。

Result: 在物体识别和分割任务中，DFMs在低数据量或高噪声条件下显著优于前馈网络。在医学影像应用中，DFMs对多种噪声干扰表现出良好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 反馈机制对于实现稳定、鲁棒和可泛化的学习至关重要，DFMs为噪声环境和小数据场景下的深度学习应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep Feedback Models (DFMs) are a new class of stateful neural networks that
combine bottom up input with high level representations over time. This
feedback mechanism introduces dynamics into otherwise static architectures,
enabling DFMs to iteratively refine their internal state and mimic aspects of
biological decision making. We model this process as a differential equation
solved through a recurrent neural network, stabilized via exponential decay to
ensure convergence. To evaluate their effectiveness, we measure DFMs under two
key conditions: robustness to noise and generalization with limited data. In
both object recognition and segmentation tasks, DFMs consistently outperform
their feedforward counterparts, particularly in low data or high noise regimes.
In addition, DFMs translate to medical imaging settings, while being robust
against various types of noise corruption. These findings highlight the
importance of feedback in achieving stable, robust, and generalizable learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的3D物体检测方法通常只能检测固定类别的物体，限制了其应用范围。本文旨在解决稀疏视图下的开集词汇3D检测问题。

Method: 采用无需训练的方法，利用预训练的2D基础模型，通过提升2D检测结果并直接优化3D提案来实现跨视图的特征一致性。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，该方法在密集采样场景下与最先进技术竞争，在稀疏视图设置下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 这种简单的方法建立了一个强大的基线，充分证明了利用2D预训练模型进行3D检测的有效性。

Abstract: The ability to interpret and comprehend a 3D scene is essential for many
vision and robotics systems. In numerous applications, this involves 3D object
detection, i.e.~identifying the location and dimensions of objects belonging to
a specific category, typically represented as bounding boxes. This has
traditionally been solved by training to detect a fixed set of categories,
which limits its use. In this work, we investigate open-vocabulary 3D object
detection in the challenging yet practical sparse-view setting, where only a
limited number of posed RGB images are available as input. Our approach is
training-free, relying on pre-trained, off-the-shelf 2D foundation models
instead of employing computationally expensive 3D feature fusion or requiring
3D-specific learning. By lifting 2D detections and directly optimizing 3D
proposals for featuremetric consistency across views, we fully leverage the
extensive training data available in 2D compared to 3D. Through standard
benchmarks, we demonstrate that this simple pipeline establishes a powerful
baseline, performing competitively with state-of-the-art techniques in densely
sampled scenarios while significantly outperforming them in the sparse-view
setting.

Motivation: 相机-雷达融合为实时3D目标检测提供了一种在恶劣天气和光照条件下鲁棒且低成本的替代方案，但目前相关研究较少，需要开发新架构来充分利用雷达点云的优势。

Method: 在BEV视角下开发相机-雷达融合算法，引入新的骨干网络将雷达柱特征映射到嵌入维度，使用自注意力机制建模雷达点之间的依赖关系，并用简化卷积层替代FPN-based卷积层以减少推理时间。

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效利用雷达优势并优化网络架构，在保持高精度的同时显著提升了推理效率，为相机-雷达融合3D检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Camera-radar fusion offers a robust and low-cost alternative to Camera-lidar
fusion for the 3D object detection task in real-time under adverse weather and
lighting conditions. However, currently, in the literature, it is possible to
find few works focusing on this modality and, most importantly, developing new
architectures to explore the advantages of the radar point cloud, such as
accurate distance estimation and speed information. Therefore, this work
presents a novel and efficient 3D object detection algorithm using cameras and
radars in the bird's-eye-view (BEV). Our algorithm exploits the advantages of
radar before fusing the features into a detection head. A new backbone is
introduced, which maps the radar pillar features into an embedded dimension. A
self-attention mechanism allows the backbone to model the dependencies between
the radar points. We are using a simplified convolutional layer to replace the
FPN-based convolutional layers used in the PointPillars-based architectures
with the main goal of reducing inference time. Our results show that with this
modification, our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art in the 3D object
detection problem, reaching 58.2 of the NDS metric for the use of ResNet-50,
while also setting a new benchmark for inference time on the nuScenes dataset
for the same category.

Motivation: 气候变化影响作物产量预测的准确性，现有方法在处理多光谱数据方面存在困难，而多光谱数据对评估作物健康至关重要。

Method: 提出MTMS-YieldNet网络，整合光谱数据和时空信息，利用对比学习进行预训练，捕捉空间-光谱模式和时空依赖关系。

Result: 在Sentinel-1、Landsat-8和Sentinel-2数据集上分别获得0.336、0.353和0.331的MAPE分数，优于7种现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MTMS-YieldNet显著提高了产量预测性能，为农民提供有价值的决策支持，有助于提高作物产量。

Abstract: Precise yield prediction is essential for agricultural sustainability and
food security. However, climate change complicates accurate yield prediction by
affecting major factors such as weather conditions, soil fertility, and farm
management systems. Advances in technology have played an essential role in
overcoming these challenges by leveraging satellite monitoring and data
analysis for precise yield estimation. Current methods rely on spatio-temporal
data for predicting crop yield, but they often struggle with multi-spectral
data, which is crucial for evaluating crop health and growth patterns. To
resolve this challenge, we propose a novel Multi-Temporal Multi-Spectral Yield
Prediction Network, MTMS-YieldNet, that integrates spectral data with
spatio-temporal information to effectively capture the correlations and
dependencies between them. While existing methods that rely on pre-trained
models trained on general visual data, MTMS-YieldNet utilizes contrastive
learning for feature discrimination during pre-training, focusing on capturing
spatial-spectral patterns and spatio-temporal dependencies from remote sensing
data. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments highlight the excellence of
the proposed MTMS-YieldNet over seven existing state-of-the-art methods.
MTMS-YieldNet achieves MAPE scores of 0.336 on Sentinel-1, 0.353 on Landsat-8,
and an outstanding 0.331 on Sentinel-2, demonstrating effective yield
prediction performance across diverse climatic and seasonal conditions. The
outstanding performance of MTMS-YieldNet improves yield predictions and
provides valuable insights that can assist farmers in making better decisions,
potentially improving crop yields.

Method: 在METER（轻量级网络）和PixelFormer（深度网络）上研究Saliency Maps、Integrated Gradients和Attention Rollout三种特征归因方法，通过选择性扰动像素来评估解释质量，并引入Attribution Fidelity指标。

Result: 实验结果表明，Saliency Maps和Integrated Gradients分别在轻量级和深度MDE模型中表现良好，能够有效突出最重要的输入特征。Attribution Fidelity能够有效识别不可靠的可视化解释。

Conclusion: 本文填补了MDE可解释性研究的空白，证明了特定特征归因方法在MDE任务中的有效性，并提出了更可靠的评估指标，为MDE模型的可靠部署提供了支持。

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence is increasingly employed to understand
the decision-making process of deep learning models and create trustworthiness
in their adoption. However, the explainability of Monocular Depth Estimation
(MDE) remains largely unexplored despite its wide deployment in real-world
applications. In this work, we study how to analyze MDE networks to map the
input image to the predicted depth map. More in detail, we investigate
well-established feature attribution methods, Saliency Maps, Integrated
Gradients, and Attention Rollout on different computationally complex models
for MDE: METER, a lightweight network, and PixelFormer, a deep network. We
assess the quality of the generated visual explanations by selectively
perturbing the most relevant and irrelevant pixels, as identified by the
explainability methods, and analyzing the impact of these perturbations on the
model's output. Moreover, since existing evaluation metrics can have some
limitations in measuring the validity of visual explanations for MDE, we
additionally introduce the Attribution Fidelity. This metric evaluates the
reliability of the feature attribution by assessing their consistency with the
predicted depth map. Experimental results demonstrate that Saliency Maps and
Integrated Gradients have good performance in highlighting the most important
input features for MDE lightweight and deep models, respectively. Furthermore,
we show that Attribution Fidelity effectively identifies whether an
explainability method fails to produce reliable visual maps, even in scenarios
where conventional metrics might suggest satisfactory results.

Conclusion: CoPAD框架能够有效融合多源轨迹数据，捕获历史轨迹间的交互信息，丰富预测多样性，生成高完整性和准确性的轨迹预测结果。

Abstract: Recently, data-driven trajectory prediction methods have achieved remarkable
results, significantly advancing the development of autonomous driving.
However, the instability of single-vehicle perception introduces certain
limitations to trajectory prediction. In this paper, a novel lightweight
framework for cooperative trajectory prediction, CoPAD, is proposed. This
framework incorporates a fusion module based on the Hungarian algorithm and
Kalman filtering, along with the Past Time Attention (PTA) module, mode
attention module and anchor-oriented decoder (AoD). It effectively performs
early fusion on multi-source trajectory data from vehicles and road
infrastructure, enabling the trajectories with high completeness and accuracy.
The PTA module can efficiently capture potential interaction information among
historical trajectories, and the mode attention module is proposed to enrich
the diversity of predictions. Additionally, the decoder based on sparse anchors
is designed to generate the final complete trajectories. Extensive experiments
show that CoPAD achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the DAIR-V2X-Seq
dataset, validating the effectiveness of the model in cooperative trajectory
prediction in V2X scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出一种自监督的单目深度估计方法，通过混合分布建模每个像素的深度，在物体边界处产生清晰的深度不连续性，无需细粒度监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单目深度估计方法在物体边界处往往产生模糊的深度值，引入虚假的3D点，而获得清晰边界通常需要非常精细的监督信号。

Method: 将每个像素的深度建模为混合分布，捕捉多个可能的深度值，将不确定性从直接回归转移到混合权重。通过方差感知损失函数和不确定性传播无缝集成到现有流程中。

Result: 在KITTI和VKITTIv2数据集上的广泛评估显示，该方法比最先进的基线方法边界清晰度提高了35%，并改善了点云质量。

Conclusion: 该方法仅使用自监督就能产生清晰的深度不连续性，为3D场景理解提供了更准确的深度估计。

Abstract: Accurate monocular depth estimation is crucial for 3D scene understanding,
but existing methods often blur depth at object boundaries, introducing
spurious intermediate 3D points. While achieving sharp edges usually requires
very fine-grained supervision, our method produces crisp depth discontinuities
using only self-supervision. Specifically, we model per-pixel depth as a
mixture distribution, capturing multiple plausible depths and shifting
uncertainty from direct regression to the mixture weights. This formulation
integrates seamlessly into existing pipelines via variance-aware loss functions
and uncertainty propagation. Extensive evaluations on KITTI and VKITTIv2 show
that our method achieves up to 35% higher boundary sharpness and improves point
cloud quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: MuproCL是一个新颖的框架，通过使用多个上下文感知原型替代单一语义目标，解决了语言引导持续学习中的语义模糊性和类内视觉多样性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的语言引导监督依赖PLM生成的单一语义目标存在两个关键限制：1）语义模糊性，多义词类别名称导致视觉表示冲突；2）类内视觉多样性，单一原型无法捕捉类内丰富的视觉外观变化。

Method: 使用轻量级LLM代理进行类别消歧和视觉模态扩展，生成鲁棒的语义原型集合，并通过LogSumExp聚合机制使视觉模型能够自适应地与给定图像最相关的原型对齐。

Result: 在各种持续学习基线上的广泛实验表明，MuproCL持续提升了性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MuproCL为语言引导的持续学习建立了一条更有效的路径，通过多原型方法解决了语义模糊和视觉多样性问题。

Abstract: Language-guided supervision, which utilizes a frozen semantic target from a
Pretrained Language Model (PLM), has emerged as a promising paradigm for visual
Continual Learning (CL). However, relying on a single target introduces two
critical limitations: 1) semantic ambiguity, where a polysemous category name
results in conflicting visual representations, and 2) intra-class visual
diversity, where a single prototype fails to capture the rich variety of visual
appearances within a class. To this end, we propose MuproCL, a novel framework
that replaces the single target with multiple, context-aware prototypes.
Specifically, we employ a lightweight LLM agent to perform category
disambiguation and visual-modal expansion to generate a robust set of semantic
prototypes. A LogSumExp aggregation mechanism allows the vision model to
adaptively align with the most relevant prototype for a given image. Extensive
experiments across various CL baselines demonstrate that MuproCL consistently
enhances performance and robustness, establishing a more effective path for
language-guided continual learning.

Conclusion: 该方法通过知识蒸馏和模态信息注入，有效提升了多模态图像匹配的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal image matching seeks pixel-level correspondences between images of
different modalities, crucial for cross-modal perception, fusion and analysis.
However, the significant appearance differences between modalities make this
task challenging. Due to the scarcity of high-quality annotated datasets,
existing deep learning methods that extract modality-common features for
matching perform poorly and lack adaptability to diverse scenarios. Vision
Foundation Model (VFM), trained on large-scale data, yields generalizable and
robust feature representations adapted to data and tasks of various modalities,
including multimodal matching. Thus, we propose DistillMatch, a multimodal
image matching method using knowledge distillation from VFM. DistillMatch
employs knowledge distillation to build a lightweight student model that
extracts high-level semantic features from VFM (including DINOv2 and DINOv3) to
assist matching across modalities. To retain modality-specific information, it
extracts and injects modality category information into the other modality's
features, which enhances the model's understanding of cross-modal correlations.
Furthermore, we design V2I-GAN to boost the model's generalization by
translating visible to pseudo-infrared images for data augmentation.
Experiments show that DistillMatch outperforms existing algorithms on public
datasets.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于因果学习的多视图聚类网络CauMVC，用于解决部分对齐数据下的广义多视图聚类问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中多视图数据往往只有部分对齐，而现有方法依赖完全对齐假设，限制了聚类性能。作者将数据顺序偏移（从完全对齐到部分对齐）导致的性能下降视为广义多视图聚类问题。

Method: 采用因果建模方法，将部分对齐数据视为干预，多视图聚类作为干预后推理。设计了变分自编码器进行因果学习，包含编码器估计不变特征和解码器执行干预后推理，并引入对比正则化器捕获样本相关性。

Result: 在完全和部分对齐数据上的实验表明，CauMVC具有强大的泛化能力和有效性。

Conclusion: 这是首个通过因果学习处理广义多视图聚类的工作，为解决部分对齐数据下的聚类问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to explore the common clustering structure
across multiple views. Many existing MVC methods heavily rely on the assumption
of view consistency, where alignments for corresponding samples across
different views are ordered in advance. However, real-world scenarios often
present a challenge as only partial data is consistently aligned across
different views, restricting the overall clustering performance. In this work,
we consider the model performance decreasing phenomenon caused by data order
shift (i.e., from fully to partially aligned) as a generalized multi-view
clustering problem. To tackle this problem, we design a causal multi-view
clustering network, termed CauMVC. We adopt a causal modeling approach to
understand multi-view clustering procedure. To be specific, we formulate the
partially aligned data as an intervention and multi-view clustering with
partially aligned data as an post-intervention inference. However, obtaining
invariant features directly can be challenging. Thus, we design a Variational
Auto-Encoder for causal learning by incorporating an encoder from existing
information to estimate the invariant features. Moreover, a decoder is designed
to perform the post-intervention inference. Lastly, we design a contrastive
regularizer to capture sample correlations. To the best of our knowledge, this
paper is the first work to deal generalized multi-view clustering via causal
learning. Empirical experiments on both fully and partially aligned data
illustrate the strong generalization and effectiveness of CauMVC.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLip是一个用于视觉语音识别的全局-局部集成渐进框架，通过双路径特征提取和两阶段渐进学习，解决现实世界中光照变化、遮挡等视觉挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VSR方法对现实世界中的视觉挑战（如光照变化、遮挡、模糊和姿态变化）关注有限，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 提出GLip框架，包含双路径特征提取架构和两阶段渐进学习：第一阶段学习视觉特征与语音单元的粗对齐，第二阶段通过上下文增强模块动态整合局部特征与全局上下文。

Result: 在LRS2和LRS3基准测试中持续优于现有方法，并在新引入的挑战性普通话数据集上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: GLip通过渐进学习策略独特地利用判别性局部区域，对各种视觉挑战表现出增强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visual speech recognition (VSR), also known as lip reading, is the task of
recognizing speech from silent video. Despite significant advancements in VSR
over recent decades, most existing methods pay limited attention to real-world
visual challenges such as illumination variations, occlusions, blurring, and
pose changes. To address these challenges, we propose GLip, a Global-Local
Integrated Progressive framework designed for robust VSR. GLip is built upon
two key insights: (i) learning an initial \textit{coarse} alignment between
visual features across varying conditions and corresponding speech content
facilitates the subsequent learning of \textit{precise} visual-to-speech
mappings in challenging environments; (ii) under adverse conditions, certain
local regions (e.g., non-occluded areas) often exhibit more discriminative cues
for lip reading than global features. To this end, GLip introduces a dual-path
feature extraction architecture that integrates both global and local features
within a two-stage progressive learning framework. In the first stage, the
model learns to align both global and local visual features with corresponding
acoustic speech units using easily accessible audio-visual data, establishing a
coarse yet semantically robust foundation. In the second stage, we introduce a
Contextual Enhancement Module (CEM) to dynamically integrate local features
with relevant global context across both spatial and temporal dimensions,
refining the coarse representations into precise visual-speech mappings. Our
framework uniquely exploits discriminative local regions through a progressive
learning strategy, demonstrating enhanced robustness against various visual
challenges and consistently outperforming existing methods on the LRS2 and LRS3
benchmarks. We further validate its effectiveness on a newly introduced
challenging Mandarin dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于字典引导图卷积网络的表面重建方法，能够同时预测控制点的位置和数量，为噪声点云数据生成平滑表面，无需使用点法线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动的表面重建算法严重依赖地面实况法线或计算近似法线作为中间步骤，这使得它们对噪声点云数据集极其不可靠。B样条重建技术虽然提供紧凑的表面表示，但现有方法预测固定数量的控制点位置，难以匹配底层表面的复杂性。

Method: 开发了字典引导图卷积网络（Dictionary-Guided Graph Convolutional Network）的表面重建策略，同时预测控制点的位置和数量，无需使用任何点法线。

Result: 通过与多个知名和近期基线方法比较，使用广泛采用的评估指标，证明该方法在定性和定量上都优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理噪声点云数据，生成平滑表面，克服了现有方法对法线依赖和控制点数量固定的局限性。

Abstract: Generating continuous surfaces from discrete point cloud data is a
fundamental task in several 3D vision applications. Real-world point clouds are
inherently noisy due to various technical and environmental factors. Existing
data-driven surface reconstruction algorithms rely heavily on ground truth
normals or compute approximate normals as an intermediate step. This dependency
makes them extremely unreliable for noisy point cloud datasets, even if the
availability of ground truth training data is ensured, which is not always the
case. B-spline reconstruction techniques provide compact surface
representations of point clouds and are especially known for their smoothening
properties. However, the complexity of the surfaces approximated using
B-splines is directly influenced by the number and location of the spline
control points. Existing spline-based modeling methods predict the locations of
a fixed number of control points for a given point cloud, which makes it very
difficult to match the complexity of its underlying surface. In this work, we
develop a Dictionary-Guided Graph Convolutional Network-based surface
reconstruction strategy where we simultaneously predict both the location and
the number of control points for noisy point cloud data to generate smooth
surfaces without the use of any point normals. We compare our reconstruction
method with several well-known as well as recent baselines by employing
widely-used evaluation metrics, and demonstrate that our method outperforms all
of them both qualitatively and quantitatively.

TL;DR: 提出LIR-GAD框架，利用多模态大语言模型进行语言指导的群体活动检测，通过引入活动级和群体级特殊标记来增强语义理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法依赖视觉特征进行隐式模式识别，缺乏上下文推理和可解释性，需要更智能的群体活动检测方法。

Method: 扩展MLLM词汇表，引入<ACT>和<GROUP>标记，结合视频帧和语言指令，设计多模态双对齐融合模块整合MLLM隐藏嵌入与视觉特征。

Result: 定量和定性实验证明该方法在群体活动检测任务中具有优越性能。

Conclusion: LIR-GAD框架通过语言指导推理有效提升了群体活动检测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Group activity detection (GAD) aims to simultaneously identify group members
and categorize their collective activities within video sequences. Existing
deep learning-based methods develop specialized architectures (e.g.,
transformer networks) to model the dynamics of individual roles and semantic
dependencies between individuals and groups. However, they rely solely on
implicit pattern recognition from visual features and struggle with contextual
reasoning and explainability. In this work, we propose LIR-GAD, a novel
framework of language-instructed reasoning for GAD via Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM). Our approach expand the original vocabulary of MLLM by
introducing an activity-level <ACT> token and multiple cluster-specific <GROUP>
tokens. We process video frames alongside two specially designed tokens and
language instructions, which are then integrated into the MLLM. The pretrained
commonsense knowledge embedded in the MLLM enables the <ACT> token and <GROUP>
tokens to effectively capture the semantic information of collective activities
and learn distinct representational features of different groups, respectively.
Also, we introduce a multi-label classification loss to further enhance the
<ACT> token's ability to learn discriminative semantic representations. Then,
we design a Multimodal Dual-Alignment Fusion (MDAF) module that integrates
MLLM's hidden embeddings corresponding to the designed tokens with visual
features, significantly enhancing the performance of GAD. Both quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed
method in GAD taks.

TL;DR: SEE&TREK是首个无需训练、专门针对视觉约束下多模态大语言模型空间理解能力提升的提示框架，通过增加视觉多样性和运动重建两大核心原则来增强空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法通常依赖深度图或点云等额外模态来改进空间推理，但纯视觉空间理解仍未被充分探索。SEE&TREK旨在填补这一空白，专注于在仅使用视觉信息的情况下提升MLLMs的空间理解能力。

Method: 1) 视觉多样性：采用最大语义丰富度采样，使用现成的感知模型提取捕捉场景结构的语义丰富关键帧；2) 运动重建：模拟视觉轨迹并将相对空间位置编码到关键帧中，以保持空间关系和时间一致性。该方法无需训练和GPU，仅需单次前向传播，可无缝集成到现有MLLMs中。

Result: 在VSI-BENCH和STI-BENCH上的广泛实验表明，SEE&TREK在各种空间推理任务中持续提升不同MLLMs的性能，最高提升达+3.5%。

Conclusion: SEE&TREK为增强空间智能提供了一条有前景的路径，证明了在纯视觉约束下通过精心设计的提示策略可以有效提升MLLMs的空间理解能力。

Abstract: We introduce SEE&TREK, the first training-free prompting framework tailored
to enhance the spatial understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMS) under vision-only constraints. While prior efforts have incorporated
modalities like depth or point clouds to improve spatial reasoning, purely
visualspatial understanding remains underexplored. SEE&TREK addresses this gap
by focusing on two core principles: increasing visual diversity and motion
reconstruction. For visual diversity, we conduct Maximum Semantic Richness
Sampling, which employs an off-the-shell perception model to extract
semantically rich keyframes that capture scene structure. For motion
reconstruction, we simulate visual trajectories and encode relative spatial
positions into keyframes to preserve both spatial relations and temporal
coherence. Our method is training&GPU-free, requiring only a single forward
pass, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLM'S. Extensive
experiments on the VSI-B ENCH and STI-B ENCH show that S EE &T REK consistently
boosts various MLLM S performance across diverse spatial reasoning tasks with
the most +3.5% improvement, offering a promising path toward stronger spatial
intelligence.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Blind-Spot Guided Diffusion的自监督图像去噪框架，通过双分支扩散模型解决盲点网络的局限性，在SIDD和DND数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决盲点网络在自监督去噪中牺牲局部细节和引入像素不连续性的问题，以及扩散模型在自监督去噪中难以适应的挑战。

Method: 采用双分支扩散框架：一个基于盲点网络的扩散分支生成半干净图像，另一个传统扩散分支捕捉底层噪声分布。使用盲点网络分支指导采样过程，在保留局部细节的同时捕捉噪声结构。

Result: 在SIDD和DND数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 该方法为真实世界图像去噪提供了一种高效的自监督解决方案，代码和预训练模型已开源。

Abstract: In this work, we present Blind-Spot Guided Diffusion, a novel self-supervised
framework for real-world image denoising. Our approach addresses two major
challenges: the limitations of blind-spot networks (BSNs), which often
sacrifice local detail and introduce pixel discontinuities due to spatial
independence assumptions, and the difficulty of adapting diffusion models to
self-supervised denoising. We propose a dual-branch diffusion framework that
combines a BSN-based diffusion branch, generating semi-clean images, with a
conventional diffusion branch that captures underlying noise distributions. To
enable effective training without paired data, we use the BSN-based branch to
guide the sampling process, capturing noise structure while preserving local
details. Extensive experiments on the SIDD and DND datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, establishing our method as a highly effective
self-supervised solution for real-world denoising. Code and pre-trained models
are released at: https://github.com/Sumching/BSGD.

TL;DR: AdaSports-Traj是一个自适应轨迹建模框架，专门解决多智能体体育场景中由于角色异构和领域差异导致的轨迹预测挑战，通过角色和领域感知适配器以及分层对比学习来提升跨角色和跨领域的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体体育场景中的轨迹预测面临角色异构（如球员与球的差异）和不同体育领域间动态分布差异的挑战，现有统一框架难以捕捉这些结构化分布偏移，导致跨角色和跨领域的泛化性能不佳。

Method: 提出AdaSports-Traj框架，核心包括：1）角色和领域感知适配器，根据智能体身份和领域上下文条件调整潜在表示；2）分层对比学习目标，分别监督角色敏感和领域感知表示，促进解耦的潜在结构而不引入优化冲突。

Result: 在三个不同的体育数据集（Basketball-U、Football-U和Soccer-U）上的实验表明，该自适应设计在统一和跨领域轨迹预测设置中均取得了强劲性能。

Conclusion: AdaSports-Traj通过显式处理域内和域间分布差异，有效提升了多智能体体育轨迹预测的泛化能力，验证了自适应建模框架在解决结构化分布偏移问题上的有效性。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction in multi-agent sports scenarios is inherently
challenging due to the structural heterogeneity across agent roles (e.g.,
players vs. ball) and dynamic distribution gaps across different sports
domains. Existing unified frameworks often fail to capture these structured
distributional shifts, resulting in suboptimal generalization across roles and
domains. We propose AdaSports-Traj, an adaptive trajectory modeling framework
that explicitly addresses both intra-domain and inter-domain distribution
discrepancies in sports. At its core, AdaSports-Traj incorporates a Role- and
Domain-Aware Adapter to conditionally adjust latent representations based on
agent identity and domain context. Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical
Contrastive Learning objective, which separately supervises role-sensitive and
domain-aware representations to encourage disentangled latent structures
without introducing optimization conflict. Experiments on three diverse sports
datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, demonstrate the effectiveness
of our adaptive design, achieving strong performance in both unified and
cross-domain trajectory prediction settings.

TL;DR: SegDINO3D是一个新颖的Transformer编码器-解码器框架，用于3D实例分割，通过利用预训练的2D检测模型的特征来提升3D表示能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于3D训练数据通常不如2D图像充足，SegDINO3D旨在充分利用预训练2D检测模型的2D表示（包括图像级和对象级特征）来改进3D表示

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构：编码器阶段通过检索对应图像视图的2D特征来丰富3D点，然后使用3D编码器进行3D上下文融合；解码器阶段将3D对象查询表示为3D锚框，并与从2D图像获得的2D对象查询进行交叉注意力

Result: 在ScanNetV2和ScanNet200 3D实例分割基准测试中达到最先进性能，特别是在具有挑战性的ScanNet200数据集上，验证集和隐藏测试集的mAP分别比先前方法高出+8.7和+6.8

Conclusion: SegDINO3D通过有效整合2D和3D表示，显著提升了3D实例分割性能，证明了其方法的优越性

Abstract: In this paper, we present SegDINO3D, a novel Transformer encoder-decoder
framework for 3D instance segmentation. As 3D training data is generally not as
sufficient as 2D training images, SegDINO3D is designed to fully leverage 2D
representation from a pre-trained 2D detection model, including both
image-level and object-level features, for improving 3D representation.
SegDINO3D takes both a point cloud and its associated 2D images as input. In
the encoder stage, it first enriches each 3D point by retrieving 2D image
features from its corresponding image views and then leverages a 3D encoder for
3D context fusion. In the decoder stage, it formulates 3D object queries as 3D
anchor boxes and performs cross-attention from 3D queries to 2D object queries
obtained from 2D images using the 2D detection model. These 2D object queries
serve as a compact object-level representation of 2D images, effectively
avoiding the challenge of keeping thousands of image feature maps in the memory
while faithfully preserving the knowledge of the pre-trained 2D model. The
introducing of 3D box queries also enables the model to modulate
cross-attention using the predicted boxes for more precise querying. SegDINO3D
achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNetV2 and ScanNet200 3D
instance segmentation benchmarks. Notably, on the challenging ScanNet200
dataset, SegDINO3D significantly outperforms prior methods by +8.7 and +6.8 mAP
on the validation and hidden test sets, respectively, demonstrating its
superiority.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于高斯分布的3D雷达检测器RadarGaussianDet3D，通过高斯原语和分布作为中间表示，解决了现有4D雷达检测器特征稀疏、检测精度不足和推理速度慢的问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有4D雷达3D检测器依赖支柱编码器进行BEV特征提取，导致特征图稀疏、表示质量下降；边界框属性独立优化导致检测精度不理想；在高性能GPU上推理速度足够，但在车载嵌入式设备上难以满足实时性要求。

Method: 设计了点高斯编码器（PGE）将每个点转换为高斯原语，使用3D高斯溅射（3DGS）技术进行BEV栅格化，生成更密集的特征图；提出盒高斯损失（BGL）将边界框转换为3D高斯分布并测量其距离，实现更全面一致的优化。

Conclusion: RadarGaussianDet3D在自动驾驶领域具有实时部署的潜力，通过高斯表示方法有效解决了现有雷达检测器的局限性。

Abstract: 4D automotive radars have gained increasing attention for autonomous driving
due to their low cost, robustness, and inherent velocity measurement
capability. However, existing 4D radar-based 3D detectors rely heavily on
pillar encoders for BEV feature extraction, where each point contributes to
only a single BEV grid, resulting in sparse feature maps and degraded
representation quality. In addition, they also optimize bounding box attributes
independently, leading to sub-optimal detection accuracy. Moreover, their
inference speed, while sufficient for high-end GPUs, may fail to meet the
real-time requirement on vehicle-mounted embedded devices. To overcome these
limitations, an efficient and effective Gaussian-based 3D detector, namely
RadarGaussianDet3D is introduced, leveraging Gaussian primitives and
distributions as intermediate representations for radar points and bounding
boxes. In RadarGaussianDet3D, a novel Point Gaussian Encoder (PGE) is designed
to transform each point into a Gaussian primitive after feature aggregation and
employs the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique for BEV rasterization,
yielding denser feature maps. PGE exhibits exceptionally low latency, owing to
the optimized algorithm for point feature aggregation and fast rendering of
3DGS. In addition, a new Box Gaussian Loss (BGL) is proposed, which converts
bounding boxes into 3D Gaussian distributions and measures their distance to
enable more comprehensive and consistent optimization. Extensive experiments on
TJ4DRadSet and View-of-Delft demonstrate that RadarGaussianDet3D achieves
state-of-the-art detection accuracy while delivering substantially faster
inference, highlighting its potential for real-time deployment in autonomous
driving.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made
aligning them with human preferences a critical challenge. Reward Models (RMs)
are a core technology for achieving this goal, but a systematic guide for
building state-of-the-art Multimodal Reward Models (MRMs) is currently lacking
in both academia and industry. Through exhaustive experimental analysis, this
paper aims to provide a clear ``recipe'' for constructing high-performance
MRMs. We systematically investigate every crucial component in the MRM
development pipeline, including \textit{reward modeling paradigms} (e.g.,
Naive-RM, Critic-based RM, and Generative RM), \textit{reward head
architecture}, \textit{training strategies}, \textit{data curation} (covering
over ten multimodal and text-only preference datasets), \textit{backbone model}
and \textit{model scale}, and \textit{ensemble methods}.
  Based on these experimental insights, we introduce \textbf{BaseReward}, a
powerful and efficient baseline for multimodal reward modeling. BaseReward
adopts a simple yet effective architecture, built upon a {Qwen2.5-VL} backbone,
featuring an optimized two-layer reward head, and is trained on a carefully
curated mixture of high-quality multimodal and text-only preference data. Our
results show that BaseReward establishes a new SOTA on major benchmarks such as
MM-RLHF-Reward Bench, VL-Reward Bench, and Multimodal Reward Bench,
outperforming previous models. Furthermore, to validate its practical utility
beyond static benchmarks, we integrate BaseReward into a real-world
reinforcement learning pipeline, successfully enhancing an MLLM's performance
across various perception, reasoning, and conversational tasks. This work not
only delivers a top-tier MRM but, more importantly, provides the community with
a clear, empirically-backed guide for developing robust reward models for the
next generation of MLLMs.

Abstract: We aim to recover the geometry of 3D parametric scenes using very few depth
measurements from low-cost, commercially available time-of-flight sensors.
These sensors offer very low spatial resolution (i.e., a single pixel), but
image a wide field-of-view per pixel and capture detailed time-of-flight data
in the form of time-resolved photon counts. This time-of-flight data encodes
rich scene information and thus enables recovery of simple scenes from sparse
measurements. We investigate the feasibility of using a distributed set of few
measurements (e.g., as few as 15 pixels) to recover the geometry of simple
parametric scenes with a strong prior, such as estimating the 6D pose of a
known object. To achieve this, we design a method that utilizes both
feed-forward prediction to infer scene parameters, and differentiable rendering
within an analysis-by-synthesis framework to refine the scene parameter
estimate. We develop hardware prototypes and demonstrate that our method
effectively recovers object pose given an untextured 3D model in both
simulations and controlled real-world captures, and show promising initial
results for other parametric scenes. We additionally conduct experiments to
explore the limits and capabilities of our imaging solution.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have recently achieved remarkable success in
generating images from textual descriptions. However, challenges still persist
in accurately rendering complex scenes where actions and interactions form the
primary semantic focus. Our key observation in this work is that T2I models
frequently struggle to capture nuanced and often implicit attributes inherent
in action depiction, leading to generating images that lack key contextual
details. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce AcT2I, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the performance of T2I models in generating images from
action-centric prompts. We experimentally validate that leading T2I models do
not fare well on AcT2I. We further hypothesize that this shortcoming arises
from the incomplete representation of the inherent attributes and contextual
dependencies in the training corpora of existing T2I models. We build upon this
by developing a training-free, knowledge distillation technique utilizing Large
Language Models to address this limitation. Specifically, we enhance prompts by
incorporating dense information across three dimensions, observing that
injecting prompts with temporal details significantly improves image generation
accuracy, with our best model achieving an increase of 72%. Our findings
highlight the limitations of current T2I methods in generating images that
require complex reasoning and demonstrate that integrating linguistic knowledge
in a systematic way can notably advance the generation of nuanced and
contextually accurate images.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在处理图像输入时表现出的视觉谄媚行为，提出了Sycophantic Reflective Tuning（SRT）方法来缓解这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现MLLMs在处理图像输入时表现出比文本LLMs更明显的视觉谄媚行为（sycophantic modality gap），需要解决这一现象。

Method: 首先尝试了简单的监督微调，但发现会导致模型过度固执。随后提出了Sycophantic Reflective Tuning（SRT）方法，让MLLM进行反思推理，判断用户指令是误导性还是纠正性的。

Result: 应用SRT后，MLLMs对误导性指令的谄媚行为显著减少，同时不会对纠正性指令表现出过度固执。

Conclusion: SRT方法有效缓解了MLLMs的视觉谄媚行为，在保持对纠正性指令开放性的同时减少了对误导性指令的盲从。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated extraordinary
capabilities in conducting conversations based on image inputs. However, we
observe that MLLMs exhibit a pronounced form of visual sycophantic behavior.
While similar behavior has also been noted in text-based large language models
(LLMs), it becomes significantly more prominent when MLLMs process image
inputs. We refer to this phenomenon as the "sycophantic modality gap." To
better understand this issue, we further analyze the factors that contribute to
the exacerbation of this gap. To mitigate the visual sycophantic behavior, we
first experiment with naive supervised fine-tuning to help the MLLM resist
misleading instructions from the user. However, we find that this approach also
makes the MLLM overly resistant to corrective instructions (i.e., stubborn even
if it is wrong). To alleviate this trade-off, we propose Sycophantic Reflective
Tuning (SRT), which enables the MLLM to engage in reflective reasoning,
allowing it to determine whether a user's instruction is misleading or
corrective before drawing a conclusion. After applying SRT, we observe a
significant reduction in sycophantic behavior toward misleading instructions,
without resulting in excessive stubbornness when receiving corrective
instructions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的防御方法，使用张量分解技术保护预训练视觉语言模型免受对抗攻击，无需重新训练或架构修改


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的防御方法通常需要昂贵的重新训练或显著的架构改变，而该方法旨在提供一种即插即用的轻量级解决方案

Method: 通过分解和重建视觉编码器表示来过滤对抗噪声，同时保留语义信息。使用张量训练分解，最佳参数为低秩(8-32)和低残差强度(α=0.1-0.2)

Result: 在Flickr30K上恢复了12.3%的性能损失，Recall@1准确率从7.5%提升到19.8%；在COCO上恢复了8.1%的性能，准确率从3.8%提升到11.9%

Conclusion: 该方法是一种实用的即插即用解决方案，对现有视觉语言模型的开销极小，能够有效提升模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) excel in multimodal understanding but are prone
to adversarial attacks. Existing defenses often demand costly retraining or
significant architecture changes. We introduce a lightweight defense using
tensor decomposition suitable for any pre-trained VLM, requiring no retraining.
By decomposing and reconstructing vision encoder representations, it filters
adversarial noise while preserving meaning. Experiments with CLIP on COCO and
Flickr30K show improved robustness. On Flickr30K, it restores 12.3\%
performance lost to attacks, raising Recall@1 accuracy from 7.5\% to 19.8\%. On
COCO, it recovers 8.1\% performance, improving accuracy from 3.8\% to 11.9\%.
Analysis shows Tensor Train decomposition with low rank (8-32) and low residual
strength ($\alpha=0.1-0.2$) is optimal. This method is a practical,
plug-and-play solution with minimal overhead for existing VLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了统一的多模态分割网络，有效解决了模态不完整问题，降低了部署成本，并在多个基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal image segmentation faces real-world deployment challenges from
incomplete/corrupted modalities degrading performance. While existing methods
address training-inference modality gaps via specialized per-combination
models, they introduce high deployment costs by requiring exhaustive model
subsets and model-modality matching. In this work, we propose a unified
modality-relax segmentation network (UniMRSeg) through hierarchical
self-supervised compensation (HSSC). Our approach hierarchically bridges
representation gaps between complete and incomplete modalities across input,
feature and output levels. % First, we adopt modality reconstruction with the
hybrid shuffled-masking augmentation, encouraging the model to learn the
intrinsic modality characteristics and generate meaningful representations for
missing modalities through cross-modal fusion. % Next, modality-invariant
contrastive learning implicitly compensates the feature space distance among
incomplete-complete modality pairs. Furthermore, the proposed lightweight
reverse attention adapter explicitly compensates for the weak perceptual
semantics in the frozen encoder. Last, UniMRSeg is fine-tuned under the hybrid
consistency constraint to ensure stable prediction under all modality
combinations without large performance fluctuations. Without bells and
whistles, UniMRSeg significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under
diverse missing modality scenarios on MRI-based brain tumor segmentation, RGB-D
semantic segmentation, RGB-D/T salient object segmentation. The code will be
released at https://github.com/Xiaoqi-Zhao-DLUT/UniMRSeg.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于二分法的Otsu阈值优化算法，将计算复杂度从O(L)降低到O(log L)，显著提高图像分割效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Otsu阈值算法因需要穷举所有可能的阈值而计算效率低下，限制了其在大规模图像处理系统中的应用

Method: 利用类间方差函数的单峰特性，采用二分法进行优化搜索，减少方差计算和算法迭代次数

Result: 在48个标准测试图像上，方差计算减少91.63%，算法迭代减少97.21%，66.67%的测试案例获得精确阈值匹配

Conclusion: 该优化方法在保持Otsu方法理论基础和分割质量的同时，解决了大规模图像处理中的计算瓶颈问题，适合实时应用

Abstract: The Otsu thresholding algorithm represents a fundamental technique in image
segmentation, yet its computational efficiency is severely limited by
exhaustive search requirements across all possible threshold values. This work
presents an optimized implementation that leverages the bisection method to
exploit the unimodal characteristics of the between-class variance function.
Our approach reduces the computational complexity from O(L) to O(log L)
evaluations while preserving segmentation accuracy. Experimental validation on
48 standard test images demonstrates a 91.63% reduction in variance
computations and 97.21% reduction in algorithmic iterations compared to
conventional exhaustive search. The bisection method achieves exact threshold
matches in 66.67% of test cases, with 95.83% exhibiting deviations within 5
gray levels. The algorithm maintains universal convergence within theoretical
logarithmic bounds while providing deterministic performance guarantees
suitable for real-time applications. This optimization addresses critical
computational bottlenecks in large-scale image processing systems without
compromising the theoretical foundations or segmentation quality of the
original Otsu method.

Abstract: Unified multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) that can both understand and
generate visual content hold immense potential. However, existing open-source
models often suffer from a performance trade-off between these capabilities. We
present Manzano, a simple and scalable unified framework that substantially
reduces this tension by coupling a hybrid image tokenizer with a well-curated
training recipe. A single shared vision encoder feeds two lightweight adapters
that produce continuous embeddings for image-to-text understanding and discrete
tokens for text-to-image generation within a common semantic space. A unified
autoregressive LLM predicts high-level semantics in the form of text and image
tokens, with an auxiliary diffusion decoder subsequently translating the image
tokens into pixels. The architecture, together with a unified training recipe
over understanding and generation data, enables scalable joint learning of both
capabilities. Manzano achieves state-of-the-art results among unified models,
and is competitive with specialist models, particularly on text-rich
evaluation. Our studies show minimal task conflicts and consistent gains from
scaling model size, validating our design choice of a hybrid tokenizer.
