### [1] [Attention-Enhanced Prototypical Learning for Few-Shot Infrastructure Defect Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05266)
*Christina Thrainer,Md Meftahul Ferdaus,Mahdi Abdelguerfi,Christian Guetl,Steven Sloan,Kendall N. Niles,Ken Pathak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出增强型特征金字塔网络(E-FPN)用于基础设施检查中的少样本语义分割，通过原型学习框架解决标注数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础设施检查应用中标注训练样本稀缺且昂贵，现有深度学习框架需要大量标注数据且难以用少量数据学习新的缺陷类别。

Method: 使用自适应E-FPN编码器（包含InceptionSepConv块和深度可分离卷积）、带掩码平均池化的原型学习、以及基于注意力的特征表示（全局自注意力、局部自注意力和交叉注意力）。

Result: 在具有挑战性的基础设施检查数据集上，最佳配置（8-way 5-shot训练）在2-way分类测试中达到82.55% F1分数和72.26% mIoU，自注意力方法带来最显著的性能提升（F1分数提升2.57%，mIoU提升2.9%）。

Conclusion: 该框架解决了基础设施检查系统中用有限新训练数据快速响应新缺陷类型的关键需求，为关键基础设施系统提供更高效经济的维护方案。

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation is vital for deep learning-based
infrastructure inspection applications, where labeled training examples are
scarce and expensive. Although existing deep learning frameworks perform well,
the need for extensive labeled datasets and the inability to learn new defect
categories with little data are problematic. We present our Enhanced Feature
Pyramid Network (E-FPN) framework for few-shot semantic segmentation of culvert
and sewer defect categories using a prototypical learning framework. Our
approach has three main contributions: (1) adaptive E-FPN encoder using
InceptionSepConv blocks and depth-wise separable convolutions for efficient
multi-scale feature extraction; (2) prototypical learning with masked average
pooling for powerful prototype generation from small support examples; and (3)
attention-based feature representation through global self-attention, local
self-attention and cross-attention. Comprehensive experimentation on
challenging infrastructure inspection datasets illustrates that the method
achieves excellent few-shot performance, with the best configuration being
8-way 5-shot training configuration at 82.55% F1-score and 72.26% mIoU in 2-way
classification testing. The self-attention method had the most significant
performance improvements, providing 2.57% F1-score and 2.9% mIoU gain over
baselines. Our framework addresses the critical need to rapidly respond to new
defect types in infrastructure inspection systems with limited new training
data that lead to more efficient and economical maintenance plans for critical
infrastructure systems.

### [2] [SkinMap: Weighted Full-Body Skin Segmentation for Robust Remote Photoplethysmography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05296)
*Zahra Maleki,Amirhossein Akbari,Amirhossein Binesh,Babak Khalaj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的皮肤分割技术，用于远程光电容积描记术(rPPG)中，通过优先选择皮肤区域来提高心率信号提取质量，在头部转动、说话等挑战性条件下仍能准确捕捉心跳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统rPPG技术对光照和运动敏感，需要改进皮肤区域选择方法以提高信号质量。现有方法在真实场景中面临干扰问题，如嘴巴、眼睛和头发等区域的干扰。

Method: 开发了一种新颖的皮肤分割技术，能够检测全身皮肤区域，同时去除可能引起干扰的区域（如嘴巴、眼睛和头发），提高对运动的鲁棒性。

Result: 在公开数据集和新创建的SYNC-rPPG数据集上评估，模型在头部转动、说话等挑战性条件下仍能保持预测心率与实际心率之间的平均绝对误差(MAE)，而其他方法无法做到。同时在不同肤色检测中表现出高准确性。

Conclusion: 该技术是现实世界应用中有前景的选择，特别是在远程患者监测、情绪分析等场景中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is an innovative method for monitoring
heart rate and vital signs by using a simple camera to record a person, as long
as any part of their skin is visible. This low-cost, contactless approach helps
in remote patient monitoring, emotion analysis, smart vehicle utilization, and
more. Over the years, various techniques have been proposed to improve the
accuracy of this technology, especially given its sensitivity to lighting and
movement. In the unsupervised pipeline, it is necessary to first select skin
regions from the video to extract the rPPG signal from the skin color changes.
We introduce a novel skin segmentation technique that prioritizes skin regions
to enhance the quality of the extracted signal. It can detect areas of skin all
over the body, making it more resistant to movement, while removing areas such
as the mouth, eyes, and hair that may cause interference. Our model is
evaluated on publicly available datasets, and we also present a new dataset,
called SYNC-rPPG, to better represent real-world conditions. The results
indicate that our model demonstrates a prior ability to capture heartbeats in
challenging conditions, such as talking and head rotation, and maintain the
mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and actual heart rates, while other
methods fail to do so. In addition, we demonstrate high accuracy in detecting a
diverse range of skin tones, making this technique a promising option for
real-world applications.

### [3] [DeepAf: One-Shot Spatiospectral Auto-Focus Model for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05315)
*Yousef Yeganeh,Maximilian Frantzen,Michael Lee,Kun-Hsing Yu,Nassir Navab,Azade Farshad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DeepAf单次对焦框架，结合空间和光谱特征，将传统显微镜改造成低成本数字病理扫描仪，对焦时间减少80%，在4倍放大倍率下实现癌症分类AUC 0.90。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全玻片成像扫描仪成本高、传统自动对焦方法耗时、现有深度学习方法需要多张输入图像或缺乏泛化能力的问题，为资源受限环境提供可访问的数字病理解决方案。

Method: 开发DeepAf自动对焦框架，通过混合架构结合空间和光谱特征进行单次对焦预测，自动回归到最佳对焦点的距离并调整控制参数。

Result: 对焦精度达0.18μm，比基于堆栈的方法减少80%对焦时间，跨实验室泛化能力强，仅0.72%错误对焦预测，90%预测在景深范围内。在536个脑组织样本临床研究中，4倍放大倍率下癌症分类AUC达0.90。

Conclusion: 该系统提供全面的硬件-软件设计，在资源受限环境中实现可访问的实时数字病理，同时保持诊断准确性。

Abstract: While Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanners remain the gold standard for
digitizing pathology samples, their high cost limits accessibility in many
healthcare settings. Other low-cost solutions also face critical limitations:
automated microscopes struggle with consistent focus across varying tissue
morphology, traditional auto-focus methods require time-consuming focal stacks,
and existing deep-learning approaches either need multiple input images or lack
generalization capability across tissue types and staining protocols. We
introduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel
auto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features
through a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed
network automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using
the extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for
optimal image outcomes. Our system transforms conventional microscopes into
efficient slide scanners, reducing focusing time by 80% compared to stack-based
methods while achieving focus accuracy of 0.18 {\mu}m on the same-lab samples,
matching the performance of dual-image methods (0.19 {\mu}m) with half the
input requirements. DeepAf demonstrates robust cross-lab generalization with
only 0.72% false focus predictions and 90% of predictions within the depth of
field. Through an extensive clinical study of 536 brain tissue samples, our
system achieves 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification, a
significant achievement at lower magnification than typical 20x WSI scans. This
results in a comprehensive hardware-software design enabling accessible,
real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings while maintaining
diagnostic accuracy.

### [5] [Mitigating Diffusion Model Hallucinations with Dynamic Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05356)
*Kostas Triaridis,Alexandros Graikos,Aggelina Chatziagapi,Grigorios G. Chrysos,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了动态引导方法，通过选择性锐化导致伪影方向的评分函数来减少扩散模型中的幻觉样本，同时保留有效的语义变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型经常产生结构不一致的幻觉样本，这些样本超出了真实数据分布的支撑集。虽然语义插值有助于生成多样性，但需要更精细的解决方案来平衡幻觉减少和多样性保留。

Method: 引入动态引导方法，该方法仅沿着已知导致伪影的方向选择性锐化评分函数，从而减少幻觉，同时保持有效的语义变化。

Result: 在受控和自然图像数据集上，动态引导显著减少了幻觉，明显优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这是第一个在生成时而非通过后处理过滤来解决幻觉问题的方法，动态引导在减少幻觉方面取得了显著效果。

Abstract: Diffusion models, despite their impressive demos, often produce hallucinatory
samples with structural inconsistencies that lie outside of the support of the
true data distribution. Such hallucinations can be attributed to excessive
smoothing between modes of the data distribution. However, semantic
interpolations are often desirable and can lead to generation diversity, thus
we believe a more nuanced solution is required. In this work, we introduce
Dynamic Guidance, which tackles this issue. Dynamic Guidance mitigates
hallucinations by selectively sharpening the score function only along the
pre-determined directions known to cause artifacts, while preserving valid
semantic variations. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that
addresses hallucinations at generation time rather than through post-hoc
filtering. Dynamic Guidance substantially reduces hallucinations on both
controlled and natural image datasets, significantly outperforming baselines.

### [6] [LightCache: Memory-Efficient, Training-Free Acceleration for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05367)
*Yang Xiao,Gen Li,Kaiyuan Deng,Yushu Wu,Zheng Zhan,Yanzhi Wang,Xiaolong Ma,Bo Hui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于视频生成扩散模型的无训练加速方法，通过分析推理过程中的编码、去噪和解码阶段，设计了阶段特定的内存优化策略来减少内存消耗，同时保持加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型推理过程中潜在表示的冗余性为加速提供了切入点，但现有的基于缓存的加速方法往往在去噪和解码阶段导致内存激增。

Method: 提出了三种阶段特定策略：1) 异步缓存交换 2) 特征分块 3) 切片潜在表示解码，这些策略的时间开销低于加速收益。

Result: 与基线相比，该方法实现了更快的推理速度和更低的内存使用，同时将质量下降控制在可接受范围内。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持视频生成质量的同时，有效解决了缓存加速方法中的内存激增问题，实现了推理速度和内存使用的双重优化。

Abstract: Training-free acceleration has emerged as an advanced research area in video
generation based on diffusion models. The redundancy of latents in diffusion
model inference provides a natural entry point for acceleration. In this paper,
we decompose the inference process into the encoding, denoising, and decoding
stages, and observe that cache-based acceleration methods often lead to
substantial memory surges in the latter two stages. To address this problem, we
analyze the characteristics of inference across different stages and propose
stage-specific strategies for reducing memory consumption: 1) Asynchronous
Cache Swapping. 2) Feature chunk. 3) Slicing latents to decode. At the same
time, we ensure that the time overhead introduced by these three strategies
remains lower than the acceleration gains themselves. Compared with the
baseline, our approach achieves faster inference speed and lower memory usage,
while maintaining quality degradation within an acceptable range. The Code is
available at https://github.com/NKUShaw/LightCache .

### [7] [See the past: Time-Reversed Scene Reconstruction from Thermal Traces Using Visual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05408)
*Kebin Contreras,Luis Toscano-Palomino,Mauro Dalla Mura,Jorge Bacca*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于热成像的时间逆向重建框架，利用配对RGB和热图像重建几秒前的场景状态，结合视觉语言模型和约束扩散过程实现语义和结构一致的重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热成像能捕捉人机交互留下的热痕迹，这些逐渐消失的印记可作为被动时间编码，推断近期事件，超越RGB相机的能力。

Method: 将视觉语言模型与约束扩散过程耦合，一个VLM生成场景描述，另一个指导图像重建，确保语义和结构一致性。

Result: 在三个受控场景中评估，证明可以重建120秒前的合理过去帧。

Conclusion: 这是从热痕迹进行时间逆向成像的第一步，展示了从热成像恢复过去场景状态的可行性。

Abstract: Recovering the past from present observations is an intriguing challenge with
potential applications in forensics and scene analysis. Thermal imaging,
operating in the infrared range, provides access to otherwise invisible
information. Since humans are typically warmer (37 C -98.6 F) than their
surroundings, interactions such as sitting, touching, or leaning leave residual
heat traces. These fading imprints serve as passive temporal codes, allowing
for the inference of recent events that exceed the capabilities of RGB cameras.
This work proposes a time-reversed reconstruction framework that uses paired
RGB and thermal images to recover scene states from a few seconds earlier. The
proposed approach couples Visual-Language Models (VLMs) with a constrained
diffusion process, where one VLM generates scene descriptions and another
guides image reconstruction, ensuring semantic and structural consistency. The
method is evaluated in three controlled scenarios, demonstrating the
feasibility of reconstructing plausible past frames up to 120 seconds earlier,
providing a first step toward time-reversed imaging from thermal traces.

### [8] [Personalizing Retrieval using Joint Embeddings or "the Return of Fluffy"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05411)
*Bruno Korbar,Andrew Zisserman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为pi-map的可训练映射网络，能够将图像中的对象实例信息转换为文本标记，结合自然语言查询实现CLIP风格的图像检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决使用复合查询检索图像的问题，即结合图像中的对象实例信息和自然文本描述来检索特定图像，例如检索"某人头上的独角兽Fluffy"这样的图像。

Method: 设计了一个映射网络，将局部图像嵌入转换为文本标记，使得该标记与自然语言查询的组合适合CLIP风格的文本编码和图像检索。每个对象实例只需训练一次映射网络。

Result: 该方法在两个个性化检索基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过可训练的pi-map映射网络结合冻结的CLIP文本和图像编码器，能够有效实现个性化图像检索，提升检索性能。

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to be able to retrieve images using a compound
query that combines object instance information from an image, with a natural
text description of what that object is doing or where it is. For example, to
retrieve an image of "Fluffy the unicorn (specified by an image) on someone's
head". To achieve this we design a mapping network that can "translate" from a
local image embedding (of the object instance) to a text token, such that the
combination of the token and a natural language query is suitable for CLIP
style text encoding, and image retrieval. Generating a text token in this
manner involves a simple training procedure, that only needs to be performed
once for each object instance. We show that our approach of using a trainable
mapping network, termed pi-map, together with frozen CLIP text and image
encoders, improves the state of the art on two benchmarks designed to assess
personalized retrieval.

### [9] [ArchitectHead: Continuous Level of Detail Control for 3D Gaussian Head Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05488)
*Peizhi Yan,Rabab Ward,Qiang Tang,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArchitectHead是一个支持连续控制细节级别的3D高斯人头像框架，通过2D UV特征空间参数化高斯点，实现渲染效率与视觉质量的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS头像使用固定数量的高斯点，无法根据实际需求调整细节级别，限制了在需要平衡渲染效率与视觉质量的应用场景中的实用性。

Method: 提出UV特征场，由多级可学习特征图组成，编码高斯点的潜在特征；通过轻量级神经网络解码器将特征转换为3D高斯属性；通过动态重采样特征图控制高斯点数量。

Result: 在最高细节级别实现SOTA质量，最低细节级别仅使用6.2%的高斯点，质量适度下降（L1损失+7.9%，PSNR-0.97%，SSIM-0.6%，LPIPS损失+24.1%），渲染速度几乎翻倍。

Conclusion: ArchitectHead实现了无需重新训练即可连续控制细节级别的3D高斯头像，在保持高质量的同时显著提升渲染效率。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled photorealistic and real-time
rendering of 3D head avatars. Existing 3DGS-based avatars typically rely on
tens of thousands of 3D Gaussian points (Gaussians), with the number of
Gaussians fixed after training. However, many practical applications require
adjustable levels of detail (LOD) to balance rendering efficiency and visual
quality. In this work, we propose "ArchitectHead", the first framework for
creating 3D Gaussian head avatars that support continuous control over LOD. Our
key idea is to parameterize the Gaussians in a 2D UV feature space and propose
a UV feature field composed of multi-level learnable feature maps to encode
their latent features. A lightweight neural network-based decoder then
transforms these latent features into 3D Gaussian attributes for rendering.
ArchitectHead controls the number of Gaussians by dynamically resampling
feature maps from the UV feature field at the desired resolutions. This method
enables efficient and continuous control of LOD without retraining.
Experimental results show that ArchitectHead achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
quality in self and cross-identity reenactment tasks at the highest LOD, while
maintaining near SOTA performance at lower LODs. At the lowest LOD, our method
uses only 6.2\% of the Gaussians while the quality degrades moderately (L1 Loss
+7.9\%, PSNR --0.97\%, SSIM --0.6\%, LPIPS Loss +24.1\%), and the rendering
speed nearly doubles.

### [10] [Human Action Recognition from Point Clouds over Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05506)
*James Dickens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D点云视频的动作识别新方法，结合点云分割、人体跟踪和体素映射技术，在NTU RGB-D 120数据集上达到89.3%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着消费级深度传感器和激光雷达的普及，利用密集3D数据进行动作识别成为可能，为骨骼动作识别和视频方法之外的第三种途径提供机会。

Method: 构建了一个处理3D视频的完整流程：从场景中分割人体点云、跟踪个体、进行身体部位分割。核心是结合点云技术和稀疏卷积网络的3D动作识别骨干网络，支持深度传感器和单目深度估计的点云输入。

Result: 在NTU RGB-D 120数据集上表现出色，与现有骨骼动作识别算法竞争力相当。通过集成传感器和估计深度输入，在训练和测试使用不同受试者时达到89.3%的准确率，优于之前的点云动作识别方法。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了利用密集3D点云数据进行动作识别的可行性，为动作识别领域提供了新的技术路径，特别是在结合多种深度输入源时能获得更好的性能。

Abstract: Recent research into human action recognition (HAR) has focused predominantly
on skeletal action recognition and video-based methods. With the increasing
availability of consumer-grade depth sensors and Lidar instruments, there is a
growing opportunity to leverage dense 3D data for action recognition, to
develop a third way. This paper presents a novel approach for recognizing
actions from 3D videos by introducing a pipeline that segments human point
clouds from the background of a scene, tracks individuals over time, and
performs body part segmentation. The method supports point clouds from both
depth sensors and monocular depth estimation. At the core of the proposed HAR
framework is a novel backbone for 3D action recognition, which combines
point-based techniques with sparse convolutional networks applied to
voxel-mapped point cloud sequences. Experiments incorporate auxiliary point
features including surface normals, color, infrared intensity, and body part
parsing labels, to enhance recognition accuracy. Evaluation on the NTU RGB- D
120 dataset demonstrates that the method is competitive with existing skeletal
action recognition algorithms. Moreover, combining both sensor-based and
estimated depth inputs in an ensemble setup, this approach achieves 89.3%
accuracy when different human subjects are considered for training and testing,
outperforming previous point cloud action recognition methods.

### [11] [Be Tangential to Manifold: Discovering Riemannian Metric for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05509)
*Shinnosuke Saito,Takashi Matsubara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的黎曼度量方法，用于在扩散模型的噪声空间中生成更符合数据流形的插值路径，解决了现有方法在感知上不自然的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型缺乏显式的低维潜在空间，限制了流形感知的分析和操作（如插值和编辑）。现有插值方法通常沿高密度区域路径，但这些路径不一定与数据流形对齐，导致感知上不自然的过渡。

Method: 提出了一种基于分数函数雅可比矩阵的黎曼度量方法，该度量鼓励噪声空间中的测地线保持在或平行于学习到的数据流形。

Result: 在图像插值实验中，该方法比现有的基于密度的方法和朴素基线方法产生感知上更自然和忠实的过渡效果。

Conclusion: 通过引入黎曼度量，能够更好地利用扩散模型学习到的数据流形，实现更自然的插值效果。

Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful deep generative models (DGMs) that generate
high-fidelity, diverse content. However, unlike classical DGMs, they lack an
explicit, tractable low-dimensional latent space that parameterizes the data
manifold. This absence limits manifold-aware analysis and operations, such as
interpolation and editing. Existing interpolation methods for diffusion models
typically follow paths through high-density regions, which are not necessarily
aligned with the data manifold and can yield perceptually unnatural
transitions. To exploit the data manifold learned by diffusion models, we
propose a novel Riemannian metric on the noise space, inspired by recent
findings that the Jacobian of the score function captures the tangent spaces to
the local data manifold. This metric encourages geodesics in the noise space to
stay within or run parallel to the learned data manifold. Experiments on image
interpolation show that our metric produces perceptually more natural and
faithful transitions than existing density-based and naive baselines.

### [12] [Teamwork: Collaborative Diffusion with Low-rank Coordination and Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05532)
*Sam Sartor,Pieter Peers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Teamwork是一个灵活高效的方法，通过协调多个基础扩散模型实例来扩展输入输出通道，无需改变预训练模型架构，支持多种图形任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通道扩展方法通常针对特定应用，难以适应不同扩散模型或新任务，需要统一的解决方案来灵活增加输入输出通道并适应新任务。

Method: 使用多个基础扩散模型实例（队友）进行协调，采用改进的低秩适应（LoRA）方法同时处理适应和协调问题，支持动态激活/停用队友。

Result: 在多种生成和逆向图形任务中表现出色，包括修复、单图像SVBRDF估计、本征分解、神经着色和本征图像合成。

Conclusion: Teamwork提供了一种灵活高效的通道扩展解决方案，能够适应多种扩散模型和图形任务，具有很好的通用性。

Abstract: Large pretrained diffusion models can provide strong priors beneficial for
many graphics applications. However, generative applications such as neural
rendering and inverse methods such as SVBRDF estimation and intrinsic image
decomposition require additional input or output channels. Current solutions
for channel expansion are often application specific and these solutions can be
difficult to adapt to different diffusion models or new tasks. This paper
introduces Teamwork: a flexible and efficient unified solution for jointly
increasing the number of input and output channels as well as adapting a
pretrained diffusion model to new tasks. Teamwork achieves channel expansion
without altering the pretrained diffusion model architecture by coordinating
and adapting multiple instances of the base diffusion model (\ie, teammates).
We employ a novel variation of Low Rank-Adaptation (LoRA) to jointly address
both adaptation and coordination between the different teammates. Furthermore
Teamwork supports dynamic (de)activation of teammates. We demonstrate the
flexibility and efficiency of Teamwork on a variety of generative and inverse
graphics tasks such as inpainting, single image SVBRDF estimation, intrinsic
decomposition, neural shading, and intrinsic image synthesis.

### [13] [Seeing the Big Picture: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs' Ability to Interpret and Grade Handwritten Student Work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05538)
*Owen Henkel,Bill Roberts,Doug Jaffe,Laurence Holt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) raise the
question of their potential for grading, analyzing, and offering feedback on
handwritten student classwork. This capability would be particularly beneficial
in elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains
handwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides
valuable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely
time-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM
performance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines
288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving
arithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved
near-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human
educators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical
illustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the
answer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require
sophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to
analyze and evaluate them. We attempted to separate MLLMs' visual capabilities
from their pedagogical abilities by first asking them to grade the student
illustrations directly, and then by augmenting the image with a detailed human
description of the illustration. We found that when the models had to analyze
the student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20
with ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement
levels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human
agreement levels. This gap suggests MLLMs can "see" and interpret arithmetic
work relatively well, but still struggle to "see" student mathematical
illustrations.

### [14] [Midway Network: Learning Representations for Recognition and Motion from Latent Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05558)
*Christopher Hoang,Mengye Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Midway Network是一种自监督学习架构，首次仅从自然视频中同时学习物体识别和运动理解的视觉表示，通过将潜在动态建模扩展到该领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督学习方法主要专注于获取识别或运动的丰富表示，而不是同时处理两者。潜在动态建模在决策制定中用于学习观察及其随时间变化的潜在表示，但尚未应用于自然视频中的视觉表示学习。

Method: Midway Network利用中途自上而下路径推断视频帧之间的运动潜在变量，采用密集前向预测目标和层次结构来处理自然视频中复杂的多对象场景。

Result: 在两个大规模自然视频数据集上预训练后，Midway Network在语义分割和光流任务上相对于先前的自监督学习方法表现出强大性能。

Conclusion: Midway Network学习的动态可以通过基于前向特征扰动的新分析方法捕获高级对应关系，证明了其在同时学习物体识别和运动理解表示方面的有效性。

Abstract: Object recognition and motion understanding are key components of perception
that complement each other. While self-supervised learning methods have shown
promise in their ability to learn from unlabeled data, they have primarily
focused on obtaining rich representations for either recognition or motion
rather than both in tandem. On the other hand, latent dynamics modeling has
been used in decision making to learn latent representations of observations
and their transformations over time for control and planning tasks. In this
work, we present Midway Network, a new self-supervised learning architecture
that is the first to learn strong visual representations for both object
recognition and motion understanding solely from natural videos, by extending
latent dynamics modeling to this domain. Midway Network leverages a midway
top-down path to infer motion latents between video frames, as well as a dense
forward prediction objective and hierarchical structure to tackle the complex,
multi-object scenes of natural videos. We demonstrate that after pretraining on
two large-scale natural video datasets, Midway Network achieves strong
performance on both semantic segmentation and optical flow tasks relative to
prior self-supervised learning methods. We also show that Midway Network's
learned dynamics can capture high-level correspondence via a novel analysis
method based on forward feature perturbation.

Abstract: Digitizing the physical world into accurate simulation-ready virtual
environments offers significant opportunities in a variety of fields such as
augmented and virtual reality, gaming, and robotics. However, current 3D
reconstruction and scene-understanding methods commonly fall short in one or
more critical aspects, such as geometry completeness, object interactivity,
physical plausibility, photorealistic rendering, or realistic physical
properties for reliable dynamic simulation. To address these limitations, we
introduce HoloScene, a novel interactive 3D reconstruction framework that
simultaneously achieves these requirements. HoloScene leverages a comprehensive
interactive scene-graph representation, encoding object geometry, appearance,
and physical properties alongside hierarchical and inter-object relationships.
Reconstruction is formulated as an energy-based optimization problem,
integrating observational data, physical constraints, and generative priors
into a unified, coherent objective. Optimization is efficiently performed via a
hybrid approach combining sampling-based exploration with gradient-based
refinement. The resulting digital twins exhibit complete and precise geometry,
physical stability, and realistic rendering from novel viewpoints. Evaluations
conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance,
while practical use-cases in interactive gaming and real-time digital-twin
manipulation illustrate HoloScene's broad applicability and effectiveness.

TL;DR: CalibCLIP是一种无需训练的方法，通过对比视觉增强器和判别概念校准器来校准视觉语言模型中主导令牌的抑制效应，提升文本驱动图像检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型存在结构限制，少数低贡献令牌可能过度捕获全局语义，主导信息聚合过程并抑制文本驱动图像检索任务中的判别特征。

Method: 提出CalibCLIP方法：在视觉空间使用对比视觉增强器将视觉特征解耦为目标和低信息区域，识别主导令牌并动态抑制其表示；在文本空间使用判别概念校准器区分文本查询中的通用和判别概念。

Result: 在涵盖三个图像检索任务的七个基准测试中均取得一致改进，证明了CalibCLIP的有效性。

Conclusion: CalibCLIP通过校准主导令牌的抑制效应，有效提升了视觉语言模型在文本驱动图像检索任务中的性能。

Abstract: Existing Visual Language Models (VLMs) suffer structural limitations where a
few low contribution tokens may excessively capture global semantics,
dominating the information aggregation process and suppressing the
discriminative features in text-driven image retrieval tasks. To address this,
we introduce \textbf{CalibCLIP}, a training-free method designed to calibrate
the suppressive effect of dominant tokens. Specifically, in the visual space,
we propose the Contrastive Visual Enhancer (CVE), which decouples visual
features into target and low information regions. Subsequently, it identifies
dominant tokens and dynamically suppresses their representations.In the textual
space, we introduce the Discriminative Concept Calibrator (DCC), which aims to
differentiate between general and discriminative concepts within the text
query. By mitigating the challenges posed by generic concepts and improving the
representations of discriminative concepts, DCC strengthens the differentiation
among similar samples. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate consistent
improvements across seven benchmarks spanning three image retrieval tasks,
underscoring the effectiveness of CalibCLIP. Code is available at:

TL;DR: ShortCoTI是一个轻量级优化框架，通过强化学习减少视觉思维链的冗余，在保持图像质量的同时将提示推理长度减少54%，提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归多模态大语言模型使用思维链推理来增强图像生成的对齐性和细节，但这种方法引入了不必要的冗余（视觉过度思考），增加了计算成本并可能产生与原始提示矛盾的细节。

Method: 提出ShortCoTI框架，通过自适应奖励函数鼓励更简洁的思维链，并将该奖励纳入强化学习范式，根据任务难度调整奖励规模。

Result: 在多个基准测试（T2I-CompBench、GenEval）上，推理长度减少54%，同时保持或略微提高质量指标。定性分析显示消除了冗长解释和重复优化。

Conclusion: ShortCoTI在不影响生成图像保真度或视觉吸引力的前提下，显著提高了计算效率，产生既简洁又语义丰富的推理提示。

Abstract: Autoregressive multimodal large language models have recently gained
popularity for image generation, driven by advances in foundation models. To
enhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image
synthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a
phenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs
and can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we
explore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image
generation. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that
encourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI
rewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to
an estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a
reinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while
maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks
(T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates
verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts
that are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves
computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of
generated images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOID方法依赖VLM先验知识，训练策略和模型架构复杂；而MLLM在人-物交互检测中的推理能力未被充分探索。

Method: 引入HOI推理过程和HOID奖励函数，通过纯文本方式解决HOID任务，使用强化学习训练MLLM。

Result: 在HICO-DET数据集上，HOI-R1达到基线方法2倍准确率，具有良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: 证明了语言模型能够在不依赖额外检测模块的情况下有效完成人-物交互检测任务，为HOID研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent Human-object interaction detection (HOID) methods highly require prior
knowledge from VLMs to enhance the interaction recognition capabilities. The
training strategies and model architectures for connecting the knowledge from
VLMs to the HOI instance representations from the object detector are
challenging, and the whole framework is complex for further development or
application. On the other hand, the inherent reasoning abilities of MLLMs on
human-object interaction detection are under-explored. Inspired by the recent
success of training MLLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) methods, we propose
HOI-R1 and first explore the potential of the language model on the HOID task
without any additional detection modules. We introduce an HOI reasoning process
and HOID reward functions to solve the HOID task by pure text. The results on
the HICO-DET dataset show that HOI-R1 achieves 2x the accuracy of the baseline
with great generalization ability. The source code is available at

Conclusion: ECM框架有效解决了自回归模型在条件生成中的效率问题，通过轻量级控制和优化采样策略实现了高效高质量的控制生成。

Abstract: Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated their
potential to rival diffusion models in image synthesis. However, for complex
spatially-conditioned generation, current AR approaches rely on fine-tuning the
pre-trained model, leading to significant training costs. In this paper, we
propose the Efficient Control Model (ECM), a plug-and-play framework featuring
a lightweight control module that introduces control signals via a distributed
architecture. This architecture consists of context-aware attention layers that
refine conditional features using real-time generated tokens, and a shared
gated feed-forward network (FFN) designed to maximize the utilization of its
limited capacity and ensure coherent control feature learning. Furthermore,
recognizing the critical role of early-stage generation in determining semantic
structure, we introduce an early-centric sampling strategy that prioritizes
learning early control sequences. This approach reduces computational cost by
lowering the number of training tokens per iteration, while a complementary
temperature scheduling during inference compensates for the resulting
insufficient training of late-stage tokens. Extensive experiments on
scale-based AR models validate that our method achieves high-fidelity and
diverse control over image generation, surpassing existing baselines while
significantly improving both training and inference efficiency.

TL;DR: PointNSP提出了一种从粗到细的自回归点云生成框架，通过多尺度分解解决了传统自回归方法因强加人工排序而无法捕捉长距离依赖关系的问题，在生成质量和效率方面都超越了扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归点云生成方法由于对无序点集强加人工排序，导致模型只能进行局部预测，无法有效捕捉长距离依赖关系，从而在生成质量上落后于扩散模型。

Method: 提出PointNSP框架，采用从粗到细的生成策略，在低分辨率下保持全局形状结构，通过下一尺度预测范式逐步细化几何细节，实现多尺度分解。

Result: 在ShapeNet上的实验表明，PointNSP首次在自回归范式中达到最先进的生成质量，在参数、训练和推理效率方面超越了强扩散基线，在8192点密集生成中优势更加明显。

Conclusion: PointNSP通过多尺度分解使自回归目标与点集的置换不变性对齐，在保持高效性的同时显著提升了生成质量，展现了良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Autoregressive point cloud generation has long lagged behind diffusion-based
approaches in quality. The performance gap stems from the fact that
autoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered
point sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local
predictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but
undermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering
its ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry,
consistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the
level-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a
coarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at
low resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher
scales through a next-scale prediction paradigm. This multi-scale factorization
aligns the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of
point sets, enabling rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed
orderings. Experiments on ShapeNet show that PointNSP establishes
state-of-the-art (SOTA) generation quality for the first time within the
autoregressive paradigm. In addition, it surpasses strong diffusion-based
baselines in parameter, training, and inference efficiency. Finally, in dense
generation with 8,192 points, PointNSP's advantages become even more
pronounced, underscoring its scalability potential.

Abstract: Tear film break-up (TFBU) analysis is critical for diagnosing dry eye
syndrome, but automated TFBU segmentation remains challenging due to the lack
of annotated datasets and integrated solutions. This paper introduces the Tear
Film Multi-task (TFM) Dataset, the first comprehensive dataset for multi-task
tear film analysis, comprising 15 high-resolution videos (totaling 6,247
frames) annotated with three vision tasks: frame-level classification ('clear',
'closed', 'broken', 'blur'), Placido Ring detection, and pixel-wise TFBU area
segmentation. Leveraging this dataset, we first propose TF-Net, a novel and
efficient baseline segmentation model. TF-Net incorporates a MobileOne-mini
backbone with re-parameterization techniques and an enhanced feature pyramid
network to achieve a favorable balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency for real-time clinical applications. We further establish benchmark
performance on the TFM segmentation subset by comparing TF-Net against several
state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models. Furthermore, we design
TF-Collab, a novel integrated real-time pipeline that synergistically leverages
models trained on all three tasks of the TFM dataset. By sequentially
orchestrating frame classification for BUT determination, pupil region
localization for input standardization, and TFBU segmentation, TF-Collab fully
automates the analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed TF-Net and TF-Collab, providing a foundation for future research
in ocular surface diagnostics. Our code and the TFM datasets are available at

TL;DR: InstaGeo是一个端到端的开源框架，通过自动化数据整理、任务特定模型蒸馏和Web地图部署，解决了地理空间基础模型部署中的数据管道缺失和模型体积过大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有地理空间基础模型缺乏处理原始卫星影像的工作流程，且下游适配模型通常保留原始编码器的全部复杂性，限制了实际部署。

Method: 集成三个核心组件：1) 自动化数据整理将原始影像转换为模型就绪数据集；2) 任务特定模型蒸馏获得紧凑高效模型；3) 无缝部署为交互式Web地图应用。

Result: 在三个应用场景中，蒸馏模型仅损失少量精度（mIoU差异-0.73pp至+1.79pp），但体积缩小8倍，显著降低计算量和碳排放。在作物分割任务中达到60.65%的SOTA mIoU，比基线提升12pp。

Conclusion: InstaGeo将研究级地理空间基础模型转化为实用的低碳工具，推动地理空间AI向数据质量和应用驱动创新转变。

Abstract: Open-access multispectral imagery from missions like Landsat 8-9 and
Sentinel-2 has fueled the development of geospatial foundation models (GFMs)
for humanitarian and environmental applications. Yet, their deployment remains
limited by (i) the absence of automated geospatial data pipelines and (ii) the
large size of fine-tuned models. Existing GFMs lack workflows for processing
raw satellite imagery, and downstream adaptations often retain the full
complexity of the original encoder.
  We present InstaGeo, an open-source, end-to-end framework that addresses
these challenges by integrating: (1) automated data curation to transform raw
imagery into model-ready datasets; (2) task-specific model distillation to
derive compact, compute-efficient models; and (3) seamless deployment as
interactive web-map applications. Using InstaGeo, we reproduced datasets from
three published studies and trained models with marginal mIoU differences of
-0.73 pp for flood mapping, -0.20 pp for crop segmentation, and +1.79 pp for
desert locust prediction. The distilled models are up to 8x smaller than
standard fine-tuned counterparts, reducing FLOPs and CO2 emissions with minimal
accuracy loss.
  Leveraging InstaGeo's streamlined data pipeline, we also curated a larger
crop segmentation dataset, achieving a state-of-the-art mIoU of 60.65%, a 12 pp
improvement over prior baselines. Moreover, InstaGeo enables users to progress
from raw data to model deployment within a single working day.
  By unifying data preparation, model compression, and deployment, InstaGeo
transforms research-grade GFMs into practical, low-carbon tools for real-time,
large-scale Earth observation. This approach shifts geospatial AI toward data
quality and application-driven innovation. Source code, datasets, and model

Conclusion: 挑战了领域内关于频谱峰值重要性的普遍假设，为开发更透明可靠的取证工具铺平了道路。

Abstract: Over the years, the forensics community has proposed several deep
learning-based detectors to mitigate the risks of generative AI. Recently,
frequency-domain artifacts (particularly periodic peaks in the magnitude
spectrum), have received significant attention, as they have been often
considered a strong indicator of synthetic image generation. However,
state-of-the-art detectors are typically used as black-boxes, and it still
remains unclear whether they truly rely on these peaks. This limits their
interpretability and trust. In this work, we conduct a systematic study to
address this question. We propose a strategy to remove spectral peaks from
images and analyze the impact of this operation on several detectors. In
addition, we introduce a simple linear detector that relies exclusively on
frequency peaks, providing a fully interpretable baseline free from the
confounding influence of deep learning. Our findings reveal that most detectors
are not fundamentally dependent on spectral peaks, challenging a widespread
assumption in the field and paving the way for more transparent and reliable
forensic tools.

Abstract: Deep metric learning (DML) aims to learn a neural network mapping data to an
embedding space, which can represent semantic similarity between data points.
Hyperbolic space is attractive for DML since it can represent richer
structures, such as tree structures. DML in hyperbolic space is based on
pair-based loss or unsupervised regularization loss. On the other hand,
supervised proxy-based losses in hyperbolic space have not been reported yet
due to some issues in applying proxy-based losses in a hyperbolic space.
However, proxy-based losses are attractive for large-scale datasets since they
have less training complexity. To address these, this paper proposes the
Combined Hyperbolic and Euclidean Soft Triple (CHEST) loss. CHEST loss is
composed of the proxy-based losses in hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces and the
regularization loss based on hyperbolic hierarchical clustering. We find that
the combination of hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces improves DML accuracy and
learning stability for both spaces. Finally, we evaluate the CHEST loss on four
benchmark datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了两个深度学习框架：AHP-CADNet用于自动诊断眼源性异常头位姿势，以及基于课程学习的插补框架处理临床数据缺失问题，在PoseGaze-AHP数据集上取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼源性异常头位姿势(AHP)是斜视等眼部错位疾病的代偿机制，早期诊断可减少并发症。但当前临床评估主要依赖主观判断，且医疗记录不完整，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 1. AHP-CADNet：多级注意力融合框架，整合眼部标志点、头部姿态特征和结构化临床属性进行可解释预测；2. 基于课程学习的插补框架：逐步利用结构化和非结构化临床笔记处理缺失数据。

Result: AHP-CADNet在分类任务中准确率达96.9-99.0%，连续变量预测误差低（MAE 0.103-0.199，R2 > 0.93）。插补框架在所有临床变量上保持高准确率（93.46-99.78%），临床依赖建模显著改善性能(p < 0.001)。

Conclusion: 两个框架在临床环境中对自动诊断和处理缺失数据都表现出有效性，为眼源性异常头位姿势的客观评估提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) is a compensatory mechanism that
arises from ocular misalignment conditions, such as strabismus, enabling
patients to reduce diplopia and preserve binocular vision. Early diagnosis
minimizes morbidity and secondary complications such as facial asymmetry;
however, current clinical assessments remain largely subjective and are further
complicated by incomplete medical records. This study addresses both challenges
through two complementary deep learning frameworks. First, AHP-CADNet is a
multi-level attention fusion framework for automated diagnosis that integrates
ocular landmarks, head pose features, and structured clinical attributes to
generate interpretable predictions. Second, a curriculum learning-based
imputation framework is designed to mitigate missing data by progressively
leveraging structured variables and unstructured clinical notes to enhance
diagnostic robustness under realistic data conditions. Evaluation on the
PoseGaze-AHP dataset demonstrates robust diagnostic performance. AHP-CADNet
achieves 96.9-99.0 percent accuracy across classification tasks and low
prediction errors for continuous variables, with MAE ranging from 0.103 to
0.199 and R2 exceeding 0.93. The imputation framework maintains high accuracy
across all clinical variables (93.46-99.78 percent with PubMedBERT), with
clinical dependency modeling yielding significant improvements (p < 0.001).
These findings confirm the effectiveness of both frameworks for automated
diagnosis and recovery from missing data in clinical settings.

Abstract: Reproducing cognitive development, group interaction, and long-term evolution
in virtual classrooms remains a core challenge for educational AI, as real
classrooms integrate open-ended cognition, dynamic social interaction,
affective factors, and multi-session development rarely captured together.
Existing approaches mostly focus on short-term or single-agent settings,
limiting systematic study of classroom complexity and cross-task reuse. We
present EduVerse, the first user-defined multi-agent simulation space that
supports environment, agent, and session customization. A distinctive
human-in-the-loop interface further allows real users to join the space. Built
on a layered CIE (Cognition-Interaction-Evolution) architecture, EduVerse
ensures individual consistency, authentic interaction, and longitudinal
adaptation in cognition, emotion, and behavior-reproducing realistic classroom
dynamics with seamless human-agent integration. We validate EduVerse in
middle-school Chinese classes across three text genres, environments, and
multiple sessions. Results show: (1) Instructional alignment: simulated IRF
rates (0.28-0.64) closely match real classrooms (0.37-0.49), indicating
pedagogical realism; (2) Group interaction and role differentiation: network
density (0.27-0.40) with about one-third of peer links realized, while
human-agent tasks indicate a balance between individual variability and
instructional stability; (3) Cross-session evolution: the positive transition
rate R+ increase by 11.7% on average, capturing longitudinal shifts in
behavior, emotion, and cognition and revealing structured learning
trajectories. Overall, EduVerse balances realism, reproducibility, and
interpretability, providing a scalable platform for educational AI. The system
will be open-sourced to foster cross-disciplinary research.

Result: 实验结果表明SD-MVSum方法在脚本驱动和通用视频摘要任务中具有竞争力，优于其他SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 通过同时考虑脚本与视频视觉和语音内容的关联性，SD-MVSum方法能够生成更相关和高质量的视频摘要，扩展的数据集为多模态视频摘要研究提供了更好的基准。

Abstract: In this work, we extend a recent method for script-driven video
summarization, originally considering just the visual content of the video, to
take into account the relevance of the user-provided script also with the
video's spoken content. In the proposed method, SD-MVSum, the dependence
between each considered pair of data modalities, i.e., script-video and
script-transcript, is modeled using a new weighted cross-modal attention
mechanism. This explicitly exploits the semantic similarity between the paired
modalities in order to promote the parts of the full-length video with the
highest relevance to the user-provided script. Furthermore, we extend two
large-scale datasets for video summarization (S-VideoXum, MrHiSum), to make
them suitable for training and evaluation of script-driven multimodal video
summarization methods. Experimental comparisons document the competitiveness of
our SD-MVSum method against other SOTA approaches for script-driven and generic
video summarization. Our new method and extended datasets are available at:

TL;DR: ARGUS提出了一种新的肝组织学亚型分类方法，通过捕获肿瘤微环境中的宏观-中观-微观层次信息，结合几何特征和分层视野对齐，在肝细胞癌和肝内胆管癌的分类中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肝原发恶性肿瘤是消化系统中最具异质性和预后多样性的癌症，其中肝细胞癌和肝内胆管癌的组织形态和细胞结构比其他常见肿瘤更为复杂。现有方法未能充分利用全切片图像中的层次金字塔结构、肿瘤微环境和几何表示等关键信息，导致对组织学表征的理解有限和分类性能不佳。

Method: ARGUS方法首先通过细胞核间的几何结构构建微观几何特征来表示细粒度细胞级模式；然后设计分层视野对齐模块来建模全切片图像中固有的宏观和中观层次交互；最后通过几何先验引导融合策略将增强的微观几何和视野特征融合为联合表示，以建模整体表型交互。

Result: 在公共和私有队列上的广泛实验表明，ARGUS在肝组织学亚型分类中实现了最先进的性能，为临床实践中的肝原发恶性肿瘤提供了有效的诊断工具。

Conclusion: ARGUS通过捕获肿瘤微环境中的层次信息，结合几何特征和分层视野对齐，显著提升了肝组织学亚型分类的性能，为肝原发恶性肿瘤的临床诊断提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Primary liver malignancies are widely recognized as the most heterogeneous
and prognostically diverse cancers of the digestive system. Among these,
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) emerge
as the two principal histological subtypes, demonstrating significantly greater
complexity in tissue morphology and cellular architecture than other common
tumors. The intricate representation of features in Whole Slide Images (WSIs)
encompasses abundant crucial information for liver cancer histological
subtyping, regarding hierarchical pyramid structure, tumor microenvironment
(TME), and geometric representation. However, recent approaches have not
adequately exploited these indispensable effective descriptors, resulting in a
limited understanding of histological representation and suboptimal subtyping
performance. To mitigate these limitations, ARGUS is proposed to advance
histological subtyping in liver cancer by capturing the macro-meso-micro
hierarchical information within the TME. Specifically, we first construct a
micro-geometry feature to represent fine-grained cell-level pattern via a
geometric structure across nuclei, thereby providing a more refined and precise
perspective for delineating pathological images. Then, a Hierarchical
Field-of-Views (FoVs) Alignment module is designed to model macro- and
meso-level hierarchical interactions inherent in WSIs. Finally, the augmented
micro-geometry and FoVs features are fused into a joint representation via
present Geometry Prior Guided Fusion strategy for modeling holistic phenotype
interactions. Extensive experiments on public and private cohorts demonstrate
that our ARGUS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in histological
subtyping of liver cancer, which provide an effective diagnostic tool for
primary liver malignancies in clinical practice.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的流程，利用预训练扩散模型将人物从参考图像无缝插入背景场景，实现真实的人物合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法往往将人物放置和个性化视为独立问题，忽略了它们之间的关联，且通常需要训练才能达到高性能。

Method: 结合反转技术和无分类器引导，实现可感知环境的全局编辑；提出掩码引导的自注意力机制，从单张参考图像保持人物身份特征。

Result: 在多样化合成场景图像中实现最先进的效果，在背景和人物身份保持方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 扩散模型本身具备在复杂场景中放置人物的知识，无需任务特定训练即可实现真实的人物插入。

Abstract: The task of realistically inserting a human from a reference image into a
background scene is highly challenging, requiring the model to (1) determine
the correct location and poses of the person and (2) perform high-quality
personalization conditioned on the background. Previous approaches often treat
them as separate problems, overlooking their interconnections, and typically
rely on training to achieve high performance. In this work, we introduce a
unified training-free pipeline that leverages pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. We show that diffusion models inherently possess the
knowledge to place people in complex scenes without requiring task-specific
training. By combining inversion techniques with classifier-free guidance, our
method achieves affordance-aware global editing, seamlessly inserting people
into scenes. Furthermore, our proposed mask-guided self-attention mechanism
ensures high-quality personalization, preserving the subject's identity,
clothing, and body features from just a single reference image. To the best of
our knowledge, we are the first to perform realistic human insertions into
scenes in a training-free manner and achieve state-of-the-art results in
diverse composite scene images with excellent identity preservation in
backgrounds and subjects.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于古典音乐会多摄像头录制自动编辑的多模态架构，将问题分解为时间分割（何时剪辑）和空间选择（如何剪辑）两个子任务，在剪辑点检测和视觉镜头选择方面优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动视频编辑在计算机视觉和多媒体领域仍是一个探索不足的任务，特别是与视频生成和场景理解相比。本文专门针对古典音乐会多摄像头录制的编辑挑战进行研究。

Method: 1. 时间分割任务：使用轻量级卷积-Transformer管道，整合音频信号的log-mel频谱图、可选图像嵌入和标量时间特征
2. 空间选择任务：用CLIP编码器更新旧的主干网络（如ResNet），并将干扰项选择约束在同一音乐会的片段中
3. 数据集构建：采用伪标签方法，将原始视频数据自动聚类为连贯的镜头片段

Result: 模型在检测剪辑点方面优于之前的基线方法，并在视觉镜头选择方面提供了有竞争力的性能，推进了多模态自动视频编辑的技术水平。

Conclusion: 本文提出的多模态架构在自动视频编辑任务中取得了先进成果，特别是在古典音乐会多摄像头录制编辑方面，为自动视频编辑领域的发展做出了贡献。

Abstract: Automated video editing remains an underexplored task in the computer vision
and multimedia domains, especially when contrasted with the growing interest in
video generation and scene understanding. In this work, we address the specific
challenge of editing multicamera recordings of classical music concerts by
decomposing the problem into two key sub-tasks: when to cut and how to cut.
Building on recent literature, we propose a novel multimodal architecture for
the temporal segmentation task (when to cut), which integrates log-mel
spectrograms from the audio signals, plus an optional image embedding, and
scalar temporal features through a lightweight convolutional-transformer
pipeline. For the spatial selection task (how to cut), we improve the
literature by updating from old backbones, e.g. ResNet, with a CLIP-based
encoder and constraining distractor selection to segments from the same
concert. Our dataset was constructed following a pseudo-labeling approach, in
which raw video data was automatically clustered into coherent shot segments.
We show that our models outperformed previous baselines in detecting cut points
and provide competitive visual shot selection, advancing the state of the art
in multimodal automated video editing.

TL;DR: 开发了一种结合形态和空间特征的图像分析流程，通过时间整合方法准确识别和量化生菜幼苗，即使在重叠叶片等复杂条件下也能实现高精度计数。该方法验证了低成本成像硬件与计算工具结合进行无损表型分析的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究立枯丝核菌(R. solani)接种对生菜种子萌发和早期发育的影响，需要一种能够准确监测复杂生长条件下幼苗动态的方法。传统图像分析在叶片重叠等情况下效果不佳。

Method: 部署多台相机连续拍摄感染组和对照组的萌发过程，开发新型图像分析流程，整合形态和空间特征，并采用时间整合方法考虑发育历史，实现个体幼苗的稳健识别。

Result: 该方法在幼苗计数和活力评估中表现出高精度，即使在密集交织生长条件下也能准确工作。R. solani感染显著降低了萌发率和早期幼苗活力。方法达到R²=0.98，RMSE=1.12。

Conclusion: 结合低成本成像硬件和先进计算工具的非破坏性表型分析方法可行且有效，时间整合方法在传统分割技术失效的复杂条件下特别有效。

Abstract: The study investigates the effects of R. solani inoculation on the
germination and early development of Lactuca sativa L. seeds using a low-cost,
image-based monitoring system. Multiple cameras were deployed to continuously
capture images of the germination process in both infected and control groups.
The objective was to assess the impact of the pathogen by analyzing germination
dynamics and growth over time. To achieve this, a novel image analysis pipeline
was developed. The algorithm integrates both morphological and spatial features
to identify and quantify individual seedlings, even under complex conditions
where traditional image analyses fails. A key innovation of the method lies in
its temporal integration: each analysis step considers not only the current
status but also their developmental across prior time points. This approach
enables robust discrimination of individual seedlings, especially when
overlapping leaves significantly hinder object separation. The method
demonstrated high accuracy in seedling counting and vigor assessment, even in
challenging scenarios characterized by dense and intertwined growth. Results
confirm that R. solani infection significantly reduces germination rates and
early seedling vigor. The study also validates the feasibility of combining
low-cost imaging hardware with advanced computational tools to obtain
phenotyping data in a non-destructive and scalable manner. The temporal
integration enabled accurate quantification of germinated seeds and precise
determination of seedling emergence timing. This approach proved particularly
effective in later stages of the experiment, where conventional segmentation
techniques failed due to overlapping or intertwined seedlings, making accurate
counting. The method achieved a coefficient of determination of 0.98 and a root
mean square error (RMSE) of 1.12, demonstrating its robustness and reliability.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于对象级别的视觉表示学习方法，通过将视觉对象视为视觉等价于语言中的单词，来提升视觉模型的语义理解和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型在推理和上下文学习能力方面落后于语言模型，作者认为这是因为现有视觉Transformer训练方案缺乏语义和上下文指导，而语言模型通过单词级别的建模自然学习到了真实分布。

Method: 采用掩码图像建模框架，但将掩码应用于视觉对象而非随机图像块，通过对象级别的表示学习来捕捉视觉元素之间的全局上下文和语义关系。

Result: 定性和定量评估表明，对象级别表示有助于学习真实世界分布，而像素平均捷径在没有这种表示时往往被学习。在VQA、GQA和ScienceQA等任务上的多模态大语言模型评估显示，该方法显著提升了推理和上下文理解能力。

Conclusion: 对象级别编码是开发更强视觉编码器和分词器的有效方向，能够缩小视觉模型与语言模型在推理能力方面的差距。

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have witnessed the rise of highly
desirable emergent capabilities, such as reasoning and in-context learning.
However, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas.
In this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and
contextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and
such a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective.
Specifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are
inherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a
realistic distribution. In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which
inevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to
directly model "object" as the visual equivalence of "word," pushing the model
to learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate
our hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach
can be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random
patches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations
reveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a
real-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned
without it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual
question answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning
and contextual understanding gained with this simple objective. We hope our
study highlights the effectiveness of object-level encoding and provides a
plausible direction for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers.
Code and model will be publicly released. Keywords: Semantic Visual Tokenizer,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型研究专注于从参考照片生成身份一致的图像，但难以准确控制年龄同时保持身份，且微调此类模型通常需要跨年龄的昂贵配对图像。

Method: 通过利用衰老的线性特性，引入年龄条件提示混合和年龄特定LoRA融合策略，采用SVDMix矩阵融合技术，实现高质量中间年龄肖像生成。

Result: AgeBooth能够从单张参考图像生成不同年龄段的真实且身份一致的人脸图像，在年龄控制和视觉质量方面优于先前最先进的基于编辑的方法。

Conclusion: AgeBooth提供了一种无需大量年龄标记数据的有效年龄控制解决方案，在年龄特定图像生成方面表现出色。

Abstract: Recent diffusion model research focuses on generating identity-consistent
images from a reference photo, but they struggle to accurately control age
while preserving identity, and fine-tuning such models often requires costly
paired images across ages. In this paper, we propose AgeBooth, a novel
age-specific finetuning approach that can effectively enhance the age control
capability of adapterbased identity personalization models without the need for
expensive age-varied datasets. To reduce dependence on a large amount of
age-labeled data, we exploit the linear nature of aging by introducing
age-conditioned prompt blending and an age-specific LoRA fusion strategy that
leverages SVDMix, a matrix fusion technique. These techniques enable
high-quality generation of intermediate-age portraits. Our AgeBooth produces
realistic and identity-consistent face images across different ages from a
single reference image. Experiments show that AgeBooth achieves superior age
control and visual quality compared to previous state-of-the-art editing-based
methods.

Conclusion: 该方法无需手动标注，显著提升下游任务性能，为数据增强提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Generating enough and diverse data through augmentation offers an efficient
solution to the time-consuming and labour-intensive process of collecting and
annotating pixel-wise images. Traditional data augmentation techniques often
face challenges in manipulating high-level semantic attributes, such as
materials and textures. In contrast, diffusion models offer a robust
alternative, by effectively utilizing text-to-image or image-to-image
transformation. However, existing diffusion-based methods are either
computationally expensive or compromise on performance. To address this issue,
we introduce a novel training-free pipeline that integrates pretrained
ControlNet and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate synthetic images
paired with pixel-level labels. This approach eliminates the need for manual
annotations and significantly improves downstream tasks. To improve the
fidelity and diversity, we add a Multi-way Prompt Generator, Mask Generator and
High-quality Image Selection module. Our results on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i
present promising performance and outperform concurrent work for one-shot
semantic segmentation.

Motivation: 现有合成图像检测研究主要关注跨生成器泛化，但忽略了同样重要的跨视觉域泛化挑战。需要更全面的评估框架来反映真实世界检测需求。

Method: FusionDetect方法结合了CLIP和Dinov2两个冻结基础模型的优势，通过提取互补特征构建统一特征空间，自适应处理生成器内容和设计的变化。

Result: FusionDetect在现有基准测试上比最接近的竞争对手准确率提高3.87%，平均精度提高6.13%；在OmniGen基准上准确率提升4.48%，并对常见图像扰动具有出色鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 不仅提出了顶级性能的检测器，还建立了新的基准和框架，为通用AI图像检测的进一步发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative models has made it increasingly crucial
to develop detectors that can reliably detect synthetic images. Although most
of the work has now focused on cross-generator generalization, we argue that
this viewpoint is too limited. Detecting synthetic images involves another
equally important challenge: generalization across visual domains. To bridge
this gap,we present the OmniGen Benchmark. This comprehensive evaluation
dataset incorporates 12 state-of-the-art generators, providing a more realistic
way of evaluating detector performance under realistic conditions. In addition,
we introduce a new method, FusionDetect, aimed at addressing both vectors of
generalization. FusionDetect draws on the benefits of two frozen foundation
models: CLIP & Dinov2. By deriving features from both complementary models,we
develop a cohesive feature space that naturally adapts to changes in both
thecontent and design of the generator. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that FusionDetect delivers not only a new state-of-the-art, which is 3.87% more
accurate than its closest competitor and 6.13% more precise on average on
established benchmarks, but also achieves a 4.48% increase in accuracy on
OmniGen,along with exceptional robustness to common image perturbations. We
introduce not only a top-performing detector, but also a new benchmark and
framework for furthering universal AI image detection. The code and dataset are

Motivation: 室外LiDAR点云的手动标注成本极高且耗时，现有方法仍需人工标注。为完全消除对标注的依赖，开发无需任何标注的实例分割方法。

Method: 使用视觉基础模型生成初始伪标签，通过时空投票模块结合2D和3D语义进行优化，引入2D先验损失和原型对比损失进行语义监督。

Result: 在无监督3D实例分割中达到新的最先进水平，mAP达到50.95%，甚至超过使用2D边界框监督的MWSIS方法(48.42%)。

Conclusion: ALISE证明了无需任何标注即可实现高质量的LiDAR实例分割，为无监督3D场景理解开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The manual annotation of outdoor LiDAR point clouds for instance segmentation
is extremely costly and time-consuming. Current methods attempt to reduce this
burden but still rely on some form of human labeling. To completely eliminate
this dependency, we introduce ALISE, a novel framework that performs LiDAR
instance segmentation without any annotations. The central challenge is to
generate high-quality pseudo-labels in a fully unsupervised manner. Our
approach starts by employing Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), guided by text
and images, to produce initial pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels
through a dedicated spatio-temporal voting module, which combines 2D and 3D
semantics for both offline and online optimization. To achieve superior feature
learning, we further introduce two forms of semantic supervision: a set of 2D
prior-based losses that inject visual knowledge into the 3D network, and a
novel prototype-based contrastive loss that builds a discriminative feature
space by exploiting 3D semantic consistency. This comprehensive design results
in significant performance gains, establishing a new state-of-the-art for
unsupervised 3D instance segmentation. Remarkably, our approach even
outperforms MWSIS, a method that operates with supervision from ground-truth
(GT) 2D bounding boxes by a margin of 2.53% in mAP (50.95% vs. 48.42%).

Conclusion: 以语义ID为中心的生成式架构能够统一检索和个性化，同时简化服务路径，在视觉搜索任务中取得显著改进。

Abstract: Traditional vision search, similar to search and recommendation systems,
follows the multi-stage cascading architecture (MCA) paradigm to balance
efficiency and conversion. Specifically, the query image undergoes feature
extraction, recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages, ultimately presenting the
user with semantically similar products that meet their preferences. This
multi-view representation discrepancy of the same object in the query and the
optimization objective collide across these stages, making it difficult to
achieve Pareto optimality in both user experience and conversion. In this
paper, an end-to-end generative framework, OneVision, is proposed to address
these problems. OneVision builds on VRQ, a vision-aligned residual quantization
encoding, which can align the vastly different representations of an object
across multiple viewpoints while preserving the distinctive features of each
product as much as possible. Then a multi-stage semantic alignment scheme is
adopted to maintain strong visual similarity priors while effectively
incorporating user-specific information for personalized preference generation.
In offline evaluations, OneVision performs on par with online MCA, while
improving inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. In A/B tests, it
achieves significant online improvements: +2.15% item CTR, +2.27% CVR, and
+3.12% order volume. These results demonstrate that a semantic ID centric,
generative architecture can unify retrieval and personalization while
simplifying the serving pathway.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效利用不可靠标签数据源，通过考虑数据源可靠性的加权训练策略，显著提升了遥感图像场景分类的性能。

Abstract: Deep learning has gained broad interest in remote sensing image scene
classification thanks to the effectiveness of deep neural networks in
extracting the semantics from complex data. However, deep networks require
large amounts of training samples to obtain good generalization capabilities
and are sensitive to errors in the training labels. This is a problem in remote
sensing since highly reliable labels can be obtained at high costs and in
limited amount. However, many sources of less reliable labeled data are
available, e.g., obsolete digital maps. In order to train deep networks with
larger datasets, we propose both the combination of single or multiple weak
sources of labeled data with a small but reliable dataset to generate
multisource labeled datasets and a novel training strategy where the
reliability of each source is taken in consideration. This is done by
exploiting the transition matrices describing the statistics of the errors of
each source. The transition matrices are embedded into the labels and used
during the training process to weigh each label according to the related
source. The proposed method acts as a weighting scheme at gradient level, where
each instance contributes with different weights to the optimization of
different classes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by
experiments on different datasets. The results proved the robustness and
capability of leveraging on unreliable source of labels of the proposed method.

Motivation: 大多数OOD检测方法将大型预训练模型视为整体编码器，仅依赖其最后一层表示进行检测，但作者认为这种传统做法忽视了中间层蕴含的丰富信息。

Method: 引入基于熵的准则，在无需训练且不访问OOD数据的情况下自动识别提供最互补信息的中间层，并选择性地整合这些中间层表示。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了OOD检测的新途径，并展示了不同训练目标和模型架构对基于置信度的OOD检测方法的影响。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliably deploying
machine learning models in the wild. Yet, most methods treat large pre-trained
models as monolithic encoders and rely solely on their final-layer
representations for detection. We challenge this wisdom. We reveal the
\textit{intermediate layers} of pre-trained models, shaped by residual
connections that subtly transform input projections, \textit{can} encode
\textit{surprisingly rich and diverse signals} for detecting distributional
shifts. Importantly, to exploit latent representation diversity across layers,
we introduce an entropy-based criterion to \textit{automatically} identify
layers offering the most complementary information in a training-free setting
-- \textit{without access to OOD data}. We show that selectively incorporating
these intermediate representations can increase the accuracy of OOD detection
by up to \textbf{$10\%$} in far-OOD and over \textbf{$7\%$} in near-OOD
benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art training-free methods across various
model architectures and training objectives. Our findings reveal a new avenue
for OOD detection research and uncover the impact of various training
objectives and model architectures on confidence-based OOD detection methods.

*Yi-Hsin Li,Thomas Sikora,Sebastian Knorr,Mårten Sjöström*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于栅格化的优化策略，结合栅格化高斯核渲染效率和Steered Mixture of Experts的边缘感知门控机制，显著加速二维图像回归任务，同时保持模型稀疏性和重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Steered Mixture of Experts框架在图像重建、压缩、去噪和超分辨率方面表现出色，但其高计算成本限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用栅格化优化策略，用栅格化公式替换全局迭代优化，结合栅格化高斯核渲染和边缘感知门控机制，实现快速参数更新和内存高效模型表示。

Result: 实现了显著更快的参数更新和更内存高效的模型表示，同时支持原生超分辨率和图像去噪等应用。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和重建保真度之间提供了新的平衡，为二维图像处理任务提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The Steered Mixture of Experts regression framework has demonstrated strong
performance in image reconstruction, compression, denoising, and
super-resolution. However, its high computational cost limits practical
applications. This work introduces a rasterization-based optimization strategy
that combines the efficiency of rasterized Gaussian kernel rendering with the
edge-aware gating mechanism of the Steered Mixture of Experts. The proposed
method is designed to accelerate two-dimensional image regression while
maintaining the model's inherent sparsity and reconstruction quality. By
replacing global iterative optimization with a rasterized formulation, the
method achieves significantly faster parameter updates and more
memory-efficient model representations. In addition, the proposed framework
supports applications such as native super-resolution and image denoising,
which are not directly achievable with standard rasterized Gaussian kernel
approaches. The combination of fast rasterized optimization with the edge-aware
structure of the Steered Mixture of Experts provides a new balance between
computational efficiency and reconstruction fidelity for two-dimensional image
processing tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督深度学习方法来检测心脏磁共振图像中的关键帧，相比传统基于心室容积的方法，能检测更多关键帧并提高检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅从左心室容积曲线推导收缩末期和舒张末期帧，无法深入分析心肌运动模式。个体心脏周期的差异使自动时间比较或亚相位分析复杂化。

Method: 使用自监督深度学习，通过密集可变形配准场计算一维运动描述符，从特征曲线中使用简单规则确定关键帧。在三个公共多中心数据集上进行独立评估。

Result: 相比基于容积的方法，在SAX和4CH视图中ED和ES检测精度分别提高了30%-51%和11%-47%。能检测ED、ES及其他三个关键帧，平均循环帧差低于1.31帧(SAX)和1.73帧(LAX)。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了时间对齐的跨患者和患者内心脏动力学分析，不受周期或相位长度影响，为心脏运动分析提供了更深入的洞察。

Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for assessing
cardiac function, but individual cardiac cycles complicate automatic temporal
comparison or sub-phase analysis. Accurate cardiac keyframe detection can
eliminate this problem. However, automatic methods solely derive end-systole
(ES) and end-diastole (ED) frames from left ventricular volume curves, which do
not provide a deeper insight into myocardial motion. We propose a
self-supervised deep learning method detecting five keyframes in short-axis
(SAX) and four-chamber long-axis (4CH) cine CMR. Initially, dense deformable
registration fields are derived from the images and used to compute a 1D motion
descriptor, which provides valuable insights into global cardiac contraction
and relaxation patterns. From these characteristic curves, keyframes are
determined using a simple set of rules. The method was independently evaluated
for both views using three public, multicentre, multidisease datasets. M&Ms-2
(n=360) dataset was used for training and evaluation, and M&Ms (n=345) and ACDC
(n=100) datasets for repeatability control. Furthermore, generalisability to
patients with rare congenital heart defects was tested using the German
Competence Network (GCN) dataset. Our self-supervised approach achieved
improved detection accuracy by 30% - 51% for SAX and 11% - 47% for 4CH in ED
and ES, as measured by cyclic frame difference (cFD), compared with the
volume-based approach. We can detect ED and ES, as well as three additional
keyframes throughout the cardiac cycle with a mean cFD below 1.31 frames for
SAX and 1.73 for LAX. Our approach enables temporally aligned inter- and
intra-patient analysis of cardiac dynamics, irrespective of cycle or phase
lengths. GitHub repository:

### [42] [Flow4Agent: Long-form Video Understanding via Motion Prior from Optical Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05836)
*Ruyang Liu,Shangkun Sun,Haoran Tang,Ge Li,Wei Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow4Agent是一个新颖的框架，通过引入光流运动先验来解决长视频理解中的冗余问题，在多个视频MLLM基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解面临时空内容冗余和MLLM上下文长度有限的挑战，现有方法过度依赖CLIP模型的语义先验，而忽略了运动信息的重要性。

Method: Flow4Agent包含两个核心模块：TGO通过粗粒度光流先验分组相似视觉内容，再用语义先验过滤无关场景；MTP利用细粒度光流信息剪枝高冗余视频token。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异：Video-MME达到64.7%，MLVU达到71.4%，LongVideoBench达到60.4%，特别在小时级视频理解任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: Flow4Agent通过结合运动先验有效解决了长视频冗余问题，证明了运动信息在长视频理解中的重要性，为基于LLM的长视频理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding has always been a challenging problem due to
the significant redundancy in both temporal and spatial contents. This
challenge is further exacerbated by the limited context length of Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs). To address this issue, many previous works have
attempted to extract key video information, where the "key" is typically
semantic-aware and heavily dependent on the CLIP model as prior. In this paper,
we propose Flow4Agent, a novel framework that pioneeringly incorporates motion
priors from optical flow to facilitate LLM-based long video understanding.
Flow4Agent mitigates the redundancy in long videos at both temporal and spatial
levels through two core modules: Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO)
adaptively refines framelevel hierarchies, which first leverages coarse flow
priors to group similar visual contents and then applies semantic priors to
filter out highly irrelevant scene information. Motion Token Pruning (MTP)
further refines the intra-frame visual representations, pruning high-redundancy
video tokens using fine-grained optical flow information. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our Flow4Agent outperforms existing methods across a wide
range of video MLLM benchmarks, especially for hour-level video understanding
tasks, achieving 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU and 60.4% on LongVideoBench.

Conclusion: acia-workflows平台成功解决了活细胞成像数据分析的可访问性和可复现性问题，为系统研究单细胞动态提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Live-cell imaging (LCI) technology enables the detailed spatio-temporal
characterization of living cells at the single-cell level, which is critical
for advancing research in the life sciences, from biomedical applications to
bioprocessing. High-throughput setups with tens to hundreds of parallel cell
cultivations offer the potential for robust and reproducible insights. However,
these insights are obscured by the large amount of LCI data recorded per
experiment. Recent advances in state-of-the-art deep learning methods for cell
segmentation and tracking now enable the automated analysis of such large data
volumes, offering unprecedented opportunities to systematically study
single-cell dynamics. The next key challenge lies in integrating these powerful
tools into accessible, flexible, and user-friendly workflows that support
routine application in biological research. In this work, we present
acia-workflows, a platform that combines three key components: (1) the
Automated live-Cell Imaging Analysis (acia) Python library, which supports the
modular design of image analysis pipelines offering eight deep learning
segmentation and tracking approaches; (2) workflows that assemble the image
analysis pipeline, its software dependencies, documentation, and visualizations
into a single Jupyter Notebook, leading to accessible, reproducible and
scalable analysis workflows; and (3) a collection of application workflows
showcasing the analysis and customization capabilities in real-world
applications. Specifically, we present three workflows to investigate various
types of microfluidic LCI experiments ranging from growth rate comparisons to
precise, minute-resolution quantitative analyses of individual dynamic cells
responses to changing oxygen conditions. Our collection of more than ten
application workflows is open source and publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BioAutoML-NAS是一种基于多模态数据的生物自动机器学习模型，通过神经架构搜索自动学习图像特征，结合元数据进行昆虫分类，在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 昆虫分类对农业管理和生态研究至关重要，但由于昆虫特征复杂、类别不平衡和大规模数据集等挑战，传统方法效果有限。

Method: 使用神经架构搜索自动学习图像特征操作，构建多细胞网络结构，通过多模态融合模块结合图像嵌入和元数据，采用交替双级优化训练策略和零操作剪枝。

Result: 在BIOSCAN-5M数据集上达到96.81%准确率、97.46%精确率、96.81%召回率和97.05% F1分数，比现有方法提升约16%、10%和8%；在Insects-1M数据集上达到93.25%准确率。

Conclusion: BioAutoML-NAS能够提供准确、可靠的昆虫分类，支持现代可持续农业发展。

Abstract: Insect classification is important for agricultural management and ecological
research, as it directly affects crop health and production. However, this task
remains challenging due to the complex characteristics of insects, class
imbalance, and large-scale datasets. To address these issues, we propose
BioAutoML-NAS, the first BioAutoML model using multimodal data, including
images, and metadata, which applies neural architecture search (NAS) for images
to automatically learn the best operations for each connection within each
cell. Multiple cells are stacked to form the full network, each extracting
detailed image feature representations. A multimodal fusion module combines
image embeddings with metadata, allowing the model to use both visual and
categorical biological information to classify insects. An alternating bi-level
optimization training strategy jointly updates network weights and architecture
parameters, while zero operations remove less important connections, producing
sparse, efficient, and high-performing architectures. Extensive evaluation on
the BIOSCAN-5M dataset demonstrates that BioAutoML-NAS achieves 96.81%
accuracy, 97.46% precision, 96.81% recall, and a 97.05% F1 score, outperforming
state-of-the-art transfer learning, transformer, AutoML, and NAS methods by
approximately 16%, 10%, and 8% respectively. Further validation on the
Insects-1M dataset obtains 93.25% accuracy, 93.71% precision, 92.74% recall,
and a 93.22% F1 score. These results demonstrate that BioAutoML-NAS provides
accurate, confident insect classification that supports modern sustainable
farming.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出D³QE方法用于检测自回归生成的图像，利用真实和伪造图像中码本的独特模式和频率分布偏差，通过离散分布差异感知的transformer实现高精度检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉自回归模型在图像生成方面取得了革命性进展，但给合成图像检测带来了新挑战。与GAN或扩散模型不同，AR模型通过离散token预测生成图像，具有独特的向量量化表示特性。

Method: 提出离散分布差异感知量化误差(D³QE)方法，引入动态码本频率统计到注意力机制中的transformer，融合语义特征和量化误差潜在表示。

Result: 构建了包含7种主流视觉AR模型的ARForensics数据集，实验显示D³QE在不同AR模型上具有优越的检测精度和强泛化能力，对真实世界扰动具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: D³QE方法有效解决了自回归生成图像的检测问题，通过利用码本频率分布差异实现了高精度和鲁棒的检测性能。

Abstract: The emergence of visual autoregressive (AR) models has revolutionized image
generation while presenting new challenges for synthetic image detection.
Unlike previous GAN or diffusion-based methods, AR models generate images
through discrete token prediction, exhibiting both marked improvements in image
synthesis quality and unique characteristics in their vector-quantized
representations. In this paper, we propose to leverage Discrete Distribution
Discrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D$^3$QE) for autoregressive-generated
image detection that exploits the distinctive patterns and the frequency
distribution bias of the codebook existing in real and fake images. We
introduce a discrete distribution discrepancy-aware transformer that integrates
dynamic codebook frequency statistics into its attention mechanism, fusing
semantic features and quantization error latent. To evaluate our method, we
construct a comprehensive dataset termed ARForensics covering 7 mainstream
visual AR models. Experiments demonstrate superior detection accuracy and
strong generalization of D$^3$QE across different AR models, with robustness to
real-world perturbations. Code is available at

*Jiesi Hu,Yanwu Yang,Zhiyu Ye,Jinyan Zhou,Jianfeng Cao,Hanyang Peng,Ting Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出弱监督上下文学习(WS-ICL)新范式，使用弱提示(如边界框或点)替代密集标签，显著降低医学图像分割的标注成本，同时保持与常规ICL模型相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有通用医学图像分割模型(交互式和上下文学习模型)需要大量标注的问题。交互式模型需要为每张图像重复用户提示，而ICL依赖密集的像素级标签。

Method: 提出WS-ICL方法，利用弱提示(边界框或点)作为上下文，而不是密集标签。这种方法消除了对细粒度掩码和所有图像重复用户提示的需求。

Result: 在三个保留基准测试上评估，WS-ICL在显著降低标注成本的同时，实现了与常规ICL模型相当的性能。在交互式范式下也表现出高度竞争力。

Conclusion: WS-ICL是朝着更高效和统一的医学图像分割通用模型迈出的有希望的一步，显著减少了标注工作量。

Abstract: Universal models for medical image segmentation, such as interactive and
in-context learning (ICL) models, offer strong generalization but require
extensive annotations. Interactive models need repeated user prompts for each
image, while ICL relies on dense, pixel-level labels. To address this, we
propose Weakly Supervised In-Context Learning (WS-ICL), a new ICL paradigm that
leverages weak prompts (e.g., bounding boxes or points) instead of dense labels
for context. This approach significantly reduces annotation effort by
eliminating the need for fine-grained masks and repeated user prompting for all
images. We evaluated the proposed WS-ICL model on three held-out benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that WS-ICL achieves performance comparable to
regular ICL models at a significantly lower annotation cost. In addition,
WS-ICL is highly competitive even under the interactive paradigm. These
findings establish WS-ICL as a promising step toward more efficient and unified
universal models for medical image segmentation. Our code and model are
publicly available at https://github.com/jiesihu/Weak-ICL.

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于物流场景缺陷检测的大规模数据集，该数据集比现有基准大40倍，包含超过23万张图像和2.9万个缺陷实例，展示了在零售物流中异常检测的新挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工业异常检测数据集（如MVTec-AD和VisA）主要关注制造场景，在姿态控制和对象类别数量上有限制，且已达到性能饱和。而零售物流中的异常检测面临对象姿态和外观多样性的新挑战，现有方法在此场景下表现不佳。

Method: 引入了一个新的大规模基准数据集，包含超过230,000张图像（29,000个缺陷实例）和48,000个不同对象，对多种最先进的异常检测方法进行了广泛评估。

Result: 现有最先进的异常检测方法在该数据集上的表现不超过56.96% AUROC，远低于在制造场景数据集上的性能（可达99.9% AUROC），表明现有方法难以在姿态和外观变化大的情况下有效利用正常样本。

Conclusion: 该数据集为零售物流异常检测设定了新的基准，揭示了现有方法的局限性，并鼓励未来研究解决这一具有挑战性的问题。

Abstract: We present a novel large-scale dataset for defect detection in a logistics
setting. Recent work on industrial anomaly detection has primarily focused on
manufacturing scenarios with highly controlled poses and a limited number of
object categories. Existing benchmarks like MVTec-AD [6] and VisA [33] have
reached saturation, with state-of-the-art methods achieving up to 99.9% AUROC
scores. In contrast to manufacturing, anomaly detection in retail logistics
faces new challenges, particularly in the diversity and variability of object
pose and appearance. Leading anomaly detection methods fall short when applied
to this new setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmark that
overcomes the current limitations of existing datasets. With over 230,000
images (and more than 29,000 defective instances), it is 40 times larger than
MVTec-AD and contains more than 48,000 distinct objects. To validate the
difficulty of the problem, we conduct an extensive evaluation of multiple
state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, demonstrating that they do not
surpass 56.96% AUROC on our dataset. Further qualitative analysis confirms that
existing methods struggle to leverage normal samples under heavy pose and
appearance variation. With our large-scale dataset, we set a new benchmark and
encourage future research towards solving this challenging problem in retail
logistics anomaly detection. The dataset is available for download under

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了医学影像中的token mixers，在MetaFormer架构下比较了池化、卷积和注意力机制，发现分类任务中低复杂度token mixers足够，分割任务中卷积的局部归纳偏置至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MetaFormer架构在计算机视觉中表现出色，但在医学影像领域应用稀少，且缺乏对不同token mixers的系统比较，可能忽视了更适合医学影像的设计选择。

Method: 在MetaFormer架构中系统分析池化、卷积和注意力三类token mixers，在8个医学影像数据集上进行图像分类和语义分割评估，并研究从自然图像预训练权重的迁移效果。

Result: 分类任务中低复杂度token mixers（如分组卷积或池化）足够，预训练权重仍然有效；分割任务中卷积token mixers的局部归纳偏置至关重要，分组卷积成为首选，能减少运行时间和参数数量。

Conclusion: 医学影像任务需要针对性的token mixer设计：分类任务适合低复杂度方案，分割任务需要卷积的局部归纳偏置，分组卷积在性能和效率间取得良好平衡。

Abstract: The generalization of the Transformer architecture via MetaFormer has
reshaped our understanding of its success in computer vision. By replacing
self-attention with simpler token mixers, MetaFormer provides strong baselines
for vision tasks. However, while extensively studied on natural image datasets,
its use in medical imaging remains scarce, and existing works rarely compare
different token mixers, potentially overlooking more suitable designs choices.
In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of token mixers for
medical imaging. We systematically analyze pooling-, convolution-, and
attention-based token mixers within the MetaFormer architecture on image
classification (global prediction task) and semantic segmentation (dense
prediction task). Our evaluation spans eight datasets covering diverse
modalities and common challenges in the medical domain. Given the prevalence of
pretraining from natural images to mitigate medical data scarcity, we also
examine transferring pretrained weights to new token mixers. Our results show
that, for classification, low-complexity token mixers (e.g. grouped convolution
or pooling) are sufficient, aligning with findings on natural images.
Pretrained weights remain useful despite the domain gap introduced by the new
token mixer. For segmentation, we find that the local inductive bias of
convolutional token mixers is essential. Grouped convolutions emerge as the
preferred choice, as they reduce runtime and parameter count compared to
standard convolutions, while the MetaFormer's channel-MLPs already provide the
necessary cross-channel interactions. Our code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is vital for safety-critical applications
such as surveillance, autonomous navigation, and medical imaging, where
visibility degradation can impair downstream task performance. Recently,
diffusion models have emerged as a promising generative paradigm for LLIE due
to their capacity to model complex image distributions via iterative denoising.
This survey provides an up-to-date critical analysis of diffusion models for
LLIE, distinctively featuring an in-depth comparative performance evaluation
against Generative Adversarial Network and Transformer-based state-of-the-art
methods, a thorough examination of practical deployment challenges, and a
forward-looking perspective on the role of emerging paradigms like foundation
models. We propose a multi-perspective taxonomy encompassing six categories:
Intrinsic Decomposition, Spectral & Latent, Accelerated, Guided, Multimodal,
and Autonomous; that map enhancement methods across physical priors,
conditioning schemes, and computational efficiency. Our taxonomy is grounded in
a hybrid view of both the model mechanism and the conditioning signals. We
evaluate qualitative failure modes, benchmark inconsistencies, and trade-offs
between interpretability, generalization, and inference efficiency. We also
discuss real-world deployment constraints (e.g., memory, energy use) and
ethical considerations. This survey aims to guide the next generation of
diffusion-based LLIE research by highlighting trends and surfacing open
research questions, including novel conditioning, real-time adaptation, and the
potential of foundation models.

Motivation: 传统形态分量分析(MCA)使用预定义的不相干字典，本文旨在开发数据驱动的自适应字典来更好地分离信号中的不同源。

Method: 扩展MCA算法，引入动态模态分解特征值聚类技术，获得数据驱动的MCA字典，形成DMCA方法。

Result: 在Adobe 240fps数据集上验证了DMCA的去噪效果，成功增强了微弱目标的信噪比，并在逆合成孔径雷达图像中分离了自行车和风杂波。

Conclusion: DMCA通过数据驱动的自适应字典，有效分离了视频和图像中的不同形态成分，在去噪和目标分离方面表现出色。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology of adapting the representation of
videos based on the dynamics of their scene content variation. In particular,
we demonstrate how the clustering of dynamic mode decomposition eigenvalues can
be leveraged to learn an adaptive video representation for separating
structurally distinct morphologies of a video. We extend the morphological
component analysis (MCA) algorithm, which uses multiple predefined incoherent
dictionaries and a sparsity prior to separate distinct sources in signals, by
introducing our novel eigenspace clustering technique to obtain data-driven MCA
dictionaries, which we call dynamic morphological component analysis (DMCA).
After deriving our novel algorithm, we offer a motivational example of DMCA
applied to a still image, then demonstrate DMCA's effectiveness in denoising
applications on videos from the Adobe 240fps dataset. Afterwards, we provide an
example of DMCA enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of a faint target summed
with a sea state, and conclude the paper by applying DMCA to separate a bicycle
from wind clutter in inverse synthetic aperture radar images.

<details>

Motivation: 随着基于扩散的图像生成和编辑技术的兴起，传统鲁棒水印方案面临新威胁，需要研究扩散模型对水印的破坏能力。

Method: 采用扩散驱动的图像再生过程，并引入针对水印信号的引导扩散攻击，理论上证明经过充分扩散变换后水印信息会消失。

Result: 在多种先进水印方案上评估，攻击后水印恢复率接近零，同时再生图像保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: 当前鲁棒水印技术在生成模型攻击下存在根本性脆弱性，需要在生成AI时代开发新的水印策略。

Abstract: Robust invisible watermarking aims to embed hidden information into images
such that the watermark can survive various image manipulations. However, the
rise of powerful diffusion-based image generation and editing techniques poses
a new threat to these watermarking schemes. In this paper, we present a
theoretical study and method demonstrating that diffusion models can
effectively break robust image watermarks that were designed to resist
conventional perturbations. We show that a diffusion-driven ``image
regeneration'' process can erase embedded watermarks while preserving
perceptual image content. We further introduce a novel guided diffusion attack
that explicitly targets the watermark signal during generation, significantly
degrading watermark detectability. Theoretically, we prove that as an image
undergoes sufficient diffusion-based transformation, the mutual information
between the watermarked image and the embedded watermark payload vanishes,
resulting in decoding failure. Experimentally, we evaluate our approach on
multiple state-of-the-art watermarking schemes (including the deep
learning-based methods StegaStamp, TrustMark, and VINE) and demonstrate
near-zero watermark recovery rates after attack, while maintaining high visual
fidelity of the regenerated images. Our findings highlight a fundamental
vulnerability in current robust watermarking techniques against generative
model-based attacks, underscoring the need for new watermarking strategies in
the era of generative AI.

dataset for this study comprises 474 crowdsourced images of hailstones from
documented hail events in Austria, which occurred between January 2022 and
September 2024. These hailstones have maximum diameters ranging from 2 to 11cm.
We estimate the hail diameters and compare four different models utilizing
one-stage and two-stage prompting strategies. The latter utilizes additional
size cues from reference objects, such as human hands, within the image. Our
results show that pretrained models already have the potential to measure
hailstone diameters from images with an average mean absolute error of 1.12cm
for the best model. In comparison to a single-stage prompt, two-stage prompting
improves the reliability of most models. Our study suggests that these
off-the-shelf models, even without fine-tuning, can complement traditional hail
sensors by extracting meaningful and spatially dense information from social
media imagery, enabling faster and more detailed assessments of severe weather
events. The automated real-time image harvesting from social media and other
sources remains an open task, but it will make our approach directly applicable
to future hail events.

Result: 该方法有效缓解了灾难性遗忘，在语义描述对齐方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的多损失框架在持续图像描述任务中表现出色，实现了更好的语义对齐和遗忘缓解效果。

Abstract: Generating accurate and coherent image captions in a continual learning
setting remains a major challenge due to catastrophic forgetting and the
difficulty of aligning evolving visual concepts with language over time. In
this work, we propose a novel multi-loss framework for continual image
captioning that integrates semantic guidance through prompt-based continual
learning and contrastive alignment. Built upon a pretrained ViT-GPT-2 backbone,
our approach combines standard cross-entropy loss with three additional
components: (1) a prompt-based cosine similarity loss that aligns image
embeddings with synthetically constructed prompts encoding objects, attributes,
and actions; (2) a CLIP-style loss that promotes alignment between image
embeddings and target caption embedding; and (3) a language-guided contrastive
loss that employs a triplet loss to enhance class-level discriminability
between tasks. Notably, our approach introduces no additional overhead at
inference time and requires no prompts during caption generation. We find that
this approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting, while achieving better
semantic caption alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code can

TL;DR: 通用实例搜索模型在刑事调查中能大幅减少人工分析监控录像的工作量，但研究发现这些模型存在意外涌现能力：即使在没有人类主体的数据集上训练，也能识别特定个体。研究评估了两种技术防护措施来限制模型的人员重识别能力，发现结合使用可将人员重识别准确率降至2%以下，同时保持82%的非人物体检索性能。但防护措施存在漏洞，突显了AI治理与数据保护交叉领域的监管问题。

Motivation: 通用实例搜索模型在刑事调查中能帮助执法部门检索感兴趣的具体对象，但研究发现这些模型存在意外涌现的人员识别能力，即使在没有人类主体的数据集上训练也能识别特定个体，这引发了对基于个人数据进行识别和画像的担忧。

Method: 研究评估了两种技术防护措施来限制模型的人员重识别能力：索引排除和混淆损失。通过实验测试这些方法在保持非人物体检索性能的同时，降低人员重识别准确率的效果。

Result: 实验表明，结合索引排除和混淆损失两种方法，可以将人员重识别准确率降至2%以下，同时保持82%的非人物体检索性能。但研究发现这些缓解措施存在关键漏洞，包括可能通过部分人物图像进行规避。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了AI治理与数据保护交叉领域的紧迫监管问题：如何对具有涌现识别能力的系统进行分类和监管？以及应该要求哪些技术标准来防止看似良性应用中出现识别能力？

Abstract: Generic instance search models can dramatically reduce the manual effort
required to analyze vast surveillance footage during criminal investigations by
retrieving specific objects of interest to law enforcement. However, our
research reveals an unintended emergent capability: through overlearning, these
models can single out specific individuals even when trained on datasets
without human subjects. This capability raises concerns regarding
identification and profiling of individuals based on their personal data, while
there is currently no clear standard on how de-identification can be achieved.
We evaluate two technical safeguards to curtail a model's person
re-identification capacity: index exclusion and confusion loss. Our experiments
demonstrate that combining these approaches can reduce person re-identification
accuracy to below 2% while maintaining 82% of retrieval performance for
non-person objects. However, we identify critical vulnerabilities in these
mitigations, including potential circumvention using partial person images.
These findings highlight urgent regulatory questions at the intersection of AI
governance and data protection: How should we classify and regulate systems
with emergent identification capabilities? And what technical standards should
be required to prevent identification capabilities from developing in seemingly
benign applications?

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长视频理解中面临两个关键挑战：1）如何减轻大量冗余信息的干扰；2）如何动态适应复杂层次结构并准确识别关键帧。

Method: 提出VideoMiner方法，迭代分割、描述和聚类长视频形成层次树结构，并引入T-GRPO（基于树的组相对策略优化）强化学习方法指导关键帧探索。

Result: 在所有长视频理解任务中取得优越性能，T-GRPO意外地激励模型自发生成推理链，树生长辅助素动态调整扩展深度，获得准确性和效率提升。

Conclusion: VideoMiner通过层次树结构和T-GRPO强化学习有效解决了长视频理解的关键挑战，在保持时间一致性的同时精确定位关键帧，实现了准确高效的长视频分析。

Abstract: Understanding hour-long videos with multi-modal large language models
(MM-LLMs) enriches the landscape of human-centered AI applications. However,
for end-to-end video understanding with LLMs, uniformly sampling video frames
results in LLMs being overwhelmed by a vast amount of irrelevant information as
video length increases. Existing hierarchical key frame extraction methods
improve the accuracy of video understanding but still face two critical
challenges. 1) How can the interference of extensive redundant information in
long videos be mitigated? 2) How can a model dynamically adapt to complex
hierarchical structures while accurately identifying key frames? To address
these issues, we propose VideoMiner, which iteratively segments, captions, and
clusters long videos, forming a hierarchical tree structure. The proposed
VideoMiner progresses from long videos to events to frames while preserving
temporal coherence, effectively addressing the first challenge. To precisely
locate key frames, we introduce T-GRPO, a tree-based group relative policy
optimization in reinforcement learning method that guides the exploration of
the VideoMiner. The proposed T-GRPO is specifically designed for tree
structures, integrating spatiotemporal information at the event level while
being guided by the question, thus solving the second challenge. We achieve
superior performance in all long-video understanding tasks and uncover several
interesting insights. Our proposed T-GRPO surprisingly incentivizes the model
to spontaneously generate a reasoning chain. Additionally, the designed tree
growth auxin dynamically adjusts the expansion depth, obtaining accuracy and
efficiency gains. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有3D人脸建模方法依赖3D形变模型，限制了表示能力；基于优化的方法质量高但计算昂贵。需要一种既能表达丰富几何细节又高效的解决方案。

Method: 扩展学习顶点下降(LVD)方法，集成逐顶点神经场优化与动态预测3D关键点的全局结构引导，采用相对空间编码迭代优化网格顶点，无需密集3D监督。

Result: 在单视图设置中达到最先进性能，在多视图场景中保持高度竞争力，同时显著减少推理时间。

Conclusion: GLVD实现了表达性强且适应性好的几何重建，同时保持了计算效率，为3D人脸重建提供了平衡质量和效率的有效方案。

Abstract: Existing 3D face modeling methods usually depend on 3D Morphable Models,
which inherently constrain the representation capacity to fixed shape priors.
Optimization-based approaches offer high-quality reconstructions but tend to be
computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce GLVD, a hybrid method for
3D face reconstruction from few-shot images that extends Learned Vertex Descent
(LVD) by integrating per-vertex neural field optimization with global
structural guidance from dynamically predicted 3D keypoints. By incorporating
relative spatial encoding, GLVD iteratively refines mesh vertices without
requiring dense 3D supervision. This enables expressive and adaptable geometry
reconstruction while maintaining computational efficiency. GLVD achieves
state-of-the-art performance in single-view settings and remains highly
competitive in multi-view scenarios, all while substantially reducing inference
time.

Motivation: 解决基于视觉观察的机器人腹腔镜手术任务中，视觉输入高维、奖励稀疏以及从原始视觉数据提取任务相关特征困难的问题。

Method: 集成MedFlamingo（医学领域专用视觉语言模型）与PPO算法，每回合处理一次任务观察和指令以生成高级规划令牌。

Result: 在LapGym的五个腹腔镜手术任务环境中，MedFlamingo PPO优于标准视觉PPO和OpenFlamingo PPO基线，任务成功率超过70%，相比基线改进幅度从66.67%到1114.29%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合医学专业知识与实时视觉反馈，证明了专业医学知识在机器人手术规划和决策中的价值。

Abstract: Vision-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) struggles with visual
observation-based robotic laparoscopic surgical tasks due to the
high-dimensional nature of visual input, the sparsity of rewards in surgical
environments, and the difficulty of extracting task-relevant features from raw
visual data. We introduce a simple approach integrating MedFlamingo, a medical
domain-specific Vision-Language Model, with PPO. Our method is evaluated on
five diverse laparoscopic surgery task environments in LapGym, using only
endoscopic visual observations. MedFlamingo PPO outperforms and converges
faster compared to both standard vision-based PPO and OpenFlamingo PPO
baselines, achieving task success rates exceeding 70% across all environments,
with improvements ranging from 66.67% to 1114.29% compared to baseline. By
processing task observations and instructions once per episode to generate
high-level planning tokens, our method efficiently combines medical expertise
with real-time visual feedback. Our results highlight the value of specialized
medical knowledge in robotic surgical planning and decision-making.

Motivation: CAPTCHA作为区分人类和机器人的工具，已成为评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的现实基准。研究发现当前商业模型在此类任务上表现不佳，需要探索如何提升其推理能力。

Method: 提出CAPTCHA-X基准，涵盖七类CAPTCHA，包含逐步推理解决方案和标注。定义五个推理导向的评估指标，并提出基于代理视觉语言模型的通用框架来利用模型内在推理能力。

Result: 该方法在五种高难度CAPTCHA类型上达到最先进性能，平均解决准确率为83.9%，显著超越现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前模型的局限性，并强调了推理能力在推进视觉空间挑战中的重要性。

Abstract: CAPTCHA, originally designed to distinguish humans from robots, has evolved
into a real-world benchmark for assessing the spatial reasoning capabilities of
vision-language models. In this work, we first show that step-by-step reasoning
is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs) to solve CAPTCHAs, which represent
high-difficulty spatial reasoning tasks, and that current commercial
vision-language models still struggle with such reasoning. In particular, we
observe that most commercial VLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) fail to
effectively solve CAPTCHAs and thus achieve low accuracy (around 21.9 percent).
However, our findings indicate that requiring the model to perform step-by-step
reasoning before generating the final coordinates can significantly enhance its
solving accuracy, underscoring the severity of the gap. To systematically study
this issue, we introduce CAPTCHA-X, the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with
reasoning, covering seven categories of CAPTCHAs (such as Gobang, hCaptcha,
etc.) with step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations. We further
define five reasoning-oriented metrics that enable a comprehensive evaluation
of models reasoning capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of reasoning,
we also propose a general agentic VLM-based framework that incorporates the
models inherent reasoning abilities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across five high-difficulty CAPTCHA types, with an average solving
accuracy of 83.9 percent, substantially surpassing existing baselines. These
results reveal the limitations of current models and highlight the importance
of reasoning in advancing visual-spatial challenges in the future.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合注意力图和统计过滤的方法，用于改进Vision Transformers的可解释性，产生更清晰、更忠实的解释图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ViT解释方法依赖注意力权重，但会产生噪声图，因为它们捕获了每层内的token-to-token交互。需要一种能过滤噪声并保持注意力可解释性的方法。

Method: 将注意力图与统计过滤相结合，去除噪声或无信息模式，并扩展了类别特定变体以产生区分性解释。

Result: 在多个数据集上评估显示，该方法产生更清晰、更可解释的图，在基于扰动的忠实度指标和人类注视数据对齐方面优于或与SOTA方法相当。

Conclusion: 注意力在适当过滤时仍然是可解释的有价值信号，该方法在保持效率的同时产生了人类可理解的解释。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become increasingly important with the rise of large
transformer models, yet many explanation methods designed for CNNs transfer
poorly to Vision Transformers (ViTs). Existing ViT explanations often rely on
attention weights, which tend to yield noisy maps as they capture
token-to-token interactions within each layer.While attribution methods
incorporating MLP blocks have been proposed, we argue that attention remains a
valuable and interpretable signal when properly filtered. We propose a method
that combines attention maps with a statistical filtering, initially proposed
for CNNs, to remove noisy or uninformative patterns and produce more faithful
explanations. We further extend our approach with a class-specific variant that
yields discriminative explanations. Evaluation against popular state-of-the-art
methods demonstrates that our approach produces sharper and more interpretable
maps. In addition to perturbation-based faithfulness metrics, we incorporate
human gaze data to assess alignment with human perception, arguing that human
interpretability remains essential for XAI. Across multiple datasets, our
approach consistently outperforms or is comparable to the SOTA methods while
remaining efficient and human plausible.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Video reasoning, the task of enabling machines to infer from dynamic visual
content through multi-step logic, is crucial for advanced AI. While the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks,
its application to video understanding remains underexplored. This paper
presents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in
video reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and
leading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a
phenomenon we term "visual thinking drift". We explain this drift through a
Bayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual
evidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models
to storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we
introduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are
verifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10
diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER
consistently achieves top performance. Our work sheds light on the distinct
challenges of video-centric reasoning and encourages the development of AI that
robustly grounds its inferences in visual evidence - for large multimodal
models that not only "think before answering", but also "see while thinking".

Abstract: Despite the success of advanced segmentation frameworks such as
TotalSegmentator (TS), accurate segmentations of the left atrial appendage
(LAA), coronary arteries (CAs), and pulmonary veins (PVs) remain a significant
challenge in medical imaging. In this work, we present the first open-source,
anatomically coherent dataset of curated, high-resolution segmentations for
these structures, supplemented with whole-heart labels produced by TS on the
publicly available ImageCAS dataset consisting of 1000 cardiac computed
tomography angiography (CCTA) scans. One purpose of the data set is to foster
novel approaches to the analysis of LAA morphology.
  LAA segmentations on ImageCAS were generated using a state-of-the-art
segmentation framework developed specifically for high resolution LAA
segmentation. We trained the network on a large private dataset with manual
annotations provided by medical readers guided by a trained cardiologist and
transferred the model to ImageCAS data. CA labels were improved from the
original ImageCAS annotations, while PV segmentations were refined from TS
outputs. In addition, we provide a list of scans from ImageCAS that contains
common data flaws such as step artefacts, LAAs extending beyond the scanner's
field of view, and other types of data defects.

Conclusion: 提出的模型能够紧凑地表征高光谱图像的多级先验，通过高效的优化算法实现了高光谱图像超分辨率的有效融合。

Abstract: Fusing a hyperspectral image with a multispectral image acquired over the
same scene, \textit{i.e.}, hyperspectral image super-resolution, has become a
popular computational way to access the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution
image. To date, a variety of fusion methods have been proposed, among which the
tensor-based ones have testified that multiple priors, such as multidimensional
low-rankness and spatial total variation at multiple levels, effectively drive
the fusion process. However, existing tensor-based models can only effectively
leverage one or two priors at one or two levels, since simultaneously
incorporating multi-level priors inevitably increases model complexity. This
introduces challenges in both balancing the weights of different priors and
optimizing multi-block structures. Concerning this, we present a novel
hyperspectral super-resolution model compactly characterizing these multi-level
priors of hyperspectral images within the tensor framework. Firstly, the
proposed model decouples the spectral low-rankness and spatial priors by
casting the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution image into spectral
subspace and spatial maps via block term decomposition. Secondly, these spatial
maps are stacked as the spatial tensor encoding the high-order spatial
low-rankness and smoothness priors, which are co-modeled via the proposed
non-convex mode-shuffled tensor correlated total variation. Finally, we draw
inspiration from the linearized alternating direction method of multipliers to
design an efficient algorithm to optimize the resulting model, theoretically
proving its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker convergence under mild conditions. Experiments
on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
The code implementation will be available from https://github.com/WongYinJ.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生存分析模型难以解释，降低了在临床环境中的实用性。传统原型学习方法关注局部相似性和静态匹配，忽略了更广泛的肿瘤背景，缺乏与基因组数据的强语义对齐。

Method: 建立统一特征原型空间，整合WSI的全局和局部特征与基因组数据；开发稳健表型表示，结合关键图像块与全局背景；使用指数原型更新策略(EMA ProtoUp)维持跨模态关联；采用分层原型匹配方案捕获全局中心性、局部典型性和队列级趋势。

Conclusion: FeatProto为关键医疗应用中的原型学习提供了新视角，通过多模态整合和分层匹配机制显著提升了癌症生存预测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Survival analysis plays a vital role in making clinical decisions. However,
the models currently in use are often difficult to interpret, which reduces
their usefulness in clinical settings. Prototype learning presents a potential
solution, yet traditional methods focus on local similarities and static
matching, neglecting the broader tumor context and lacking strong semantic
alignment with genomic data. To overcome these issues, we introduce an
innovative prototype-based multimodal framework, FeatProto, aimed at enhancing
cancer survival prediction by addressing significant limitations in current
prototype learning methodologies within pathology. Our framework establishes a
unified feature prototype space that integrates both global and local features
of whole slide images (WSI) with genomic profiles. This integration facilitates
traceable and interpretable decision-making processes. Our approach includes
three main innovations: (1) A robust phenotype representation that merges
critical patches with global context, harmonized with genomic data to minimize
local bias. (2) An Exponential Prototype Update Strategy (EMA ProtoUp) that
sustains stable cross-modal associations and employs a wandering mechanism to
adapt prototypes flexibly to tumor heterogeneity. (3) A hierarchical prototype
matching scheme designed to capture global centrality, local typicality, and
cohort-level trends, thereby refining prototype inference. Comprehensive
evaluations on four publicly available cancer datasets indicate that our method
surpasses current leading unimodal and multimodal survival prediction
techniques in both accuracy and interoperability, providing a new perspective
on prototype learning for critical medical applications. Our source code is
available at https://github.com/JSLiam94/FeatProto.

Abstract: Deep learning in medical imaging is often limited by scarce and imbalanced
annotated data. We present SSGNet, a unified framework that combines class
specific generative modeling with iterative semisupervised pseudo labeling to
enhance both classification and segmentation. Rather than functioning as a
standalone model, SSGNet augments existing baselines by expanding training data
with StyleGAN3 generated images and refining labels through iterative pseudo
labeling. Experiments across multiple medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate
consistent gains in classification and segmentation performance, while Frechet
Inception Distance analysis confirms the high quality of generated samples.

Conclusion: MeDiM支持连贯且临床基础的多模态输出，展示了跨模态统一生成在医学领域的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative medical models are constrained by
modality-specific scenarios that hinder the integration of complementary
evidence from imaging, pathology, and clinical notes. This fragmentation limits
their evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the
full spectrum of biomedical data. We propose MeDiM, the first medical discrete
diffusion model that learns shared distributions across modalities without
modality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks:
translating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs
across domains in response to prompts. Built on a discrete diffusion framework,
MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared
probabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we
employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone,
leveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning. Two key designs are
introduced: (1) removing the causal attention mask for bidirectional context,
and (2) injecting continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness.
Experiments demonstrate high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on
MIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR
0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance
downstream performance (plus6.43 percent BLEU-1, plus18.57 percent BLEU-2,
plus31.58 percent BLEU-3, plus4.80 percent METEOR), showing that MeDiM supports
coherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs.

TL;DR: FlowRVS将视频对象分割重新定义为条件连续流问题，利用预训练T2V模型的优势，通过语言引导的变形从视频整体表示直接生成目标掩码，在多个基准测试中达到新的SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统'定位-分割'流水线存在的信息瓶颈和时序一致性问题，传统方法将语义简化为粗糙几何提示，且分割过程与初始语言定位解耦。

Method: 将RVOS重构为条件连续流问题，学习从视频整体表示到目标掩码的语言引导直接变形，采用单阶段生成方法。

Result: 在MeViS上达到51.1的J&F分数（比之前SOTA提高1.6），在零样本Ref-DAVIS17上达到73.3（提高2.7）。

Conclusion: 将视频理解任务建模为连续变形过程具有显著潜力，FlowRVS展示了这种方法的有效性。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting specific
objects in a video guided by a natural language description. The core challenge
of RVOS is to anchor abstract linguistic concepts onto a specific set of pixels
and continuously segment them through the complex dynamics of a video. Faced
with this difficulty, prior work has often decomposed the task into a pragmatic
`locate-then-segment' pipeline. However, this cascaded design creates an
information bottleneck by simplifying semantics into coarse geometric prompts
(e.g, point), and struggles to maintain temporal consistency as the segmenting
process is often decoupled from the initial language grounding. To overcome
these fundamental limitations, we propose FlowRVS, a novel framework that
reconceptualizes RVOS as a conditional continuous flow problem. This allows us
to harness the inherent strengths of pretrained T2V models, fine-grained pixel
control, text-video semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. Instead of
conventional generating from noise to mask or directly predicting mask, we
reformulate the task by learning a direct, language-guided deformation from a
video's holistic representation to its target mask. Our one-stage, generative
approach achieves new state-of-the-art results across all major RVOS
benchmarks. Specifically, achieving a $\mathcal{J}\&\mathcal{F}$ of 51.1 in
MeViS (+1.6 over prior SOTA) and 73.3 in the zero shot Ref-DAVIS17 (+2.7),
demonstrating the significant potential of modeling video understanding tasks
as continuous deformation processes.

Abstract: We tackle the problem of forecasting bimanual 3D hand motion & articulation
from a single image in everyday settings. To address the lack of 3D hand
annotations in diverse settings, we design an annotation pipeline consisting of
a diffusion model to lift 2D hand keypoint sequences to 4D hand motion. For the

benefits of training on diverse data with imputed labels (14% improvement) and
effectiveness of our lifting (42% better) & forecasting (16.4% gain) models,
over the best baselines, especially in zero-shot generalization to everyday

TL;DR: 提出了一个从视频直接生成4D形状的端到端框架，通过时间注意力机制、时间感知点采样和4D潜在锚定以及跨帧噪声共享来确保时间一致性，能够准确捕捉非刚性运动、体积变化甚至拓扑转换。


<details>

Motivation: 视频条件4D形状生成旨在直接从输入视频恢复随时间变化的3D几何和视图一致的外观，但现有方法存在时间不一致和优化效率低的问题。

Method: 基于大规模预训练3D模型，引入三个关键组件：时间注意力机制、时间感知点采样和4D潜在锚定、跨帧噪声共享，实现端到端的动态3D表示生成。

Result: 在多样化野外视频中，该方法相比基线提高了鲁棒性和感知保真度，减少了失败模式，能够准确捕捉非刚性运动、体积变化和拓扑转换。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了直接从视频生成时间一致的4D形状，无需逐帧优化，在几何和纹理的时间一致性方面表现出色。

Abstract: Video-conditioned 4D shape generation aims to recover time-varying 3D
geometry and view-consistent appearance directly from an input video. In this
work, we introduce a native video-to-4D shape generation framework that
synthesizes a single dynamic 3D representation end-to-end from the video. Our
framework introduces three key components based on large-scale pre-trained 3D
models: (i) a temporal attention that conditions generation on all frames while
producing a time-indexed dynamic representation; (ii) a time-aware point
sampling and 4D latent anchoring that promote temporally consistent geometry
and texture; and (iii) noise sharing across frames to enhance temporal
stability. Our method accurately captures non-rigid motion, volume changes, and
even topological transitions without per-frame optimization. Across diverse
in-the-wild videos, our method improves robustness and perceptual fidelity and
reduces failure modes compared with the baselines.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have sparked exciting new possibilities
in the field of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, video generation models are
now being explored as controllable virtual testing environments.
Simultaneously, end-to-end (E2E) driving models have emerged as a streamlined
alternative to conventional modular autonomous driving systems, gaining
popularity for their simplicity and scalability. However, the application of
these techniques to simulation and planning raises important questions. First,
while video generation models can generate increasingly realistic videos, can
these videos faithfully adhere to the specified conditions and be realistic
enough for E2E autonomous planner evaluation? Second, given that data is
crucial for understanding and controlling E2E planners, how can we gain deeper
insights into their biases and improve their ability to generalize to
out-of-distribution scenarios? In this work, we bridge the gap between the
driving models and generative world models (Drive&Gen) to address these
questions. We propose novel statistical measures leveraging E2E drivers to
evaluate the realism of generated videos. By exploiting the controllability of
the video generation model, we conduct targeted experiments to investigate
distribution gaps affecting E2E planner performance. Finally, we show that
synthetic data produced by the video generation model offers a cost-effective
alternative to real-world data collection. This synthetic data effectively
improves E2E model generalization beyond existing Operational Design Domains,
facilitating the expansion of autonomous vehicle services into new operational
contexts.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型难以融入精细的相机元数据（如光圈设置），无法实现精确的镜头模糊控制。

Method: 首先生成全对焦图像，估计单目深度，使用新型焦点距离变换器预测焦点距离，然后通过可微分镜头模糊模型生成散焦图像，整个过程支持梯度反向传播。

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型能够在不改变场景内容的情况下实现更精细的控制。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了基于内容元素和EXIF数据的精确交互式散焦效果控制，这是现有扩散模型无法达到的。

Abstract: Current text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating diverse,
high-quality images, yet they struggle to incorporate fine-grained camera
metadata such as precise aperture settings. In this work, we introduce a novel
text-to-image diffusion framework that leverages camera metadata, or EXIF data,
which is often embedded in image files, with an emphasis on generating
controllable lens blur. Our method mimics the physical image formation process
by first generating an all-in-focus image, estimating its monocular depth,
predicting a plausible focus distance with a novel focus distance transformer,
and then forming a defocused image with an existing differentiable lens blur
model. Gradients flow backwards through this whole process, allowing us to
learn without explicit supervision to generate defocus effects based on content
elements and the provided EXIF data. At inference time, this enables precise
interactive user control over defocus effects while preserving scene contents,
which is not achievable with existing diffusion models. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model enables superior fine-grained control without
altering the depicted scene.

TL;DR: DropD-SLAM是一个实时单目SLAM系统，通过三个预训练视觉模块替代深度传感器，达到RGB-D级别的精度，在动态和静态场景中都表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个不依赖深度传感器但能达到RGB-D级别精度的实时SLAM系统，以降低系统成本和复杂性。

Method: 使用三个预训练视觉模块：单目度量深度估计器、学习关键点检测器和实例分割网络。通过扩张实例掩码抑制动态物体，将静态关键点赋予预测深度值并反投影到3D空间，形成度量尺度特征，然后由未修改的RGB-D SLAM后端处理。

Result: 在TUM RGB-D基准测试中，静态序列平均ATE为7.4厘米，动态序列为1.8厘米，性能达到或超过最先进的RGB-D方法，在单个GPU上以22 FPS运行。

Conclusion: 现代预训练视觉模型可以替代主动深度传感器作为可靠、实时的度量尺度来源，为实现更简单、成本更低的SLAM系统迈出了一步。

Abstract: We present DropD-SLAM, a real-time monocular SLAM system that achieves
RGB-D-level accuracy without relying on depth sensors. The system replaces
active depth input with three pretrained vision modules: a monocular metric
depth estimator, a learned keypoint detector, and an instance segmentation
network. Dynamic objects are suppressed using dilated instance masks, while
static keypoints are assigned predicted depth values and backprojected into 3D
to form metrically scaled features. These are processed by an unmodified RGB-D
SLAM back end for tracking and mapping. On the TUM RGB-D benchmark, DropD-SLAM
attains 7.4 cm mean ATE on static sequences and 1.8 cm on dynamic sequences,
matching or surpassing state-of-the-art RGB-D methods while operating at 22 FPS
on a single GPU. These results suggest that modern pretrained vision models can
replace active depth sensors as reliable, real-time sources of metric scale,
marking a step toward simpler and more cost-effective SLAM systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有第一人称视觉基准主要关注白天场景，忽略了现实应用中不可避免的低光照条件，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 收集Blender渲染的合成视频和真实世界录制视频，确保场景和动作在视觉和时间上对齐，构建EgoNight-VQA数据集，采用日增强夜自动标注引擎并通过人工验证。

Result: EgoNight-VQA包含90个视频中的3658个QA对，涵盖12种QA类型，评估显示最先进的多模态大语言模型从白天到夜晚转移时性能显著下降。

Conclusion: EgoNight为推进应用驱动的第一人称视觉研究提供了坚实基础，有助于开发跨光照域泛化的模型。

Abstract: Most existing benchmarks for egocentric vision understanding focus primarily
on daytime scenarios, overlooking the low-light conditions that are inevitable
in real-world applications. To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the
first comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual
question answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the
introduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation
quality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between
lighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered
by Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are
visually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct
EgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and
refinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked
by annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs
across 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of
human work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to
night, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions.
Beyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night
correspondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further
explore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a
strong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research
and for developing models that generalize across illumination domains. All the
data and code will be made available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: Human3R是一个统一的、前馈的框架，用于从单目视频中在线重建4D人体-场景，无需多阶段流程和迭代优化，能一次性恢复多人SMPL-X身体、3D场景和相机轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖多阶段流程、迭代优化和多种预处理（如人体检测、深度估计、SLAM），导致效率低下且复杂。Human3R旨在消除这些依赖，实现高效、统一的在线重建。

Method: 基于CUT3R模型，采用参数高效的视觉提示调优，保留时空先验，直接输出多个SMPL-X身体。统一模型无需迭代优化，训练仅需一天在单个GPU上。

Result: 在BEDLAM数据集上训练后，Human3R实现实时重建（15 FPS），内存占用低（8 GB），在人体运动估计、网格恢复、深度估计和相机姿态估计等任务中达到先进或竞争性性能。

Conclusion: Human3R作为一个简单而强大的基线模型，易于扩展至下游应用，为4D人体-场景重建提供了高效的统一解决方案。

Abstract: We present Human3R, a unified, feed-forward framework for online 4D
human-scene reconstruction, in the world frame, from casually captured
monocular videos. Unlike previous approaches that rely on multi-stage
pipelines, iterative contact-aware refinement between humans and scenes, and
heavy dependencies, e.g., human detection, depth estimation, and SLAM
pre-processing, Human3R jointly recovers global multi-person SMPL-X bodies
("everyone"), dense 3D scene ("everywhere"), and camera trajectories in a
single forward pass ("all-at-once"). Our method builds upon the 4D online
reconstruction model CUT3R, and uses parameter-efficient visual prompt tuning,
to strive to preserve CUT3R's rich spatiotemporal priors, while enabling direct
readout of multiple SMPL-X bodies. Human3R is a unified model that eliminates
heavy dependencies and iterative refinement. After being trained on the
relatively small-scale synthetic dataset BEDLAM for just one day on one GPU, it
achieves superior performance with remarkable efficiency: it reconstructs
multiple humans in a one-shot manner, along with 3D scenes, in one stage, at
real-time speed (15 FPS) with a low memory footprint (8 GB). Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Human3R delivers state-of-the-art or competitive
performance across tasks, including global human motion estimation, local human
mesh recovery, video depth estimation, and camera pose estimation, with a
single unified model. We hope that Human3R will serve as a simple yet strong
baseline, be easily extended for downstream applications.Code available in
