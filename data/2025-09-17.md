*Mustafa Khanbhai,Giulia Di Nardo,Jun Ma,Vivienne Freitas,Caterina Masino,Ali Dolatabadi,Zhaoxun "Lorenz" Liu,Wey Leong,Wagner H. Souza,Amin Madani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于U-Mamba架构的人机协同机器学习方法，用于改进3D解剖结构分割和重建算法的泛化能力，在乳腺MRI数据上取得了优异的分割性能，并展示了在临床规划和患者教育中的应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分割模型在处理多样化数据集时泛化能力不足，需要开发能够跨数据集泛化的准确算法来支持有效的术前规划。

Method: 处理120例回顾性乳腺MRI数据，采用三阶段流程：数据匿名化和手动分割、配准和分割（全乳、纤维腺体组织和肿瘤）、ITK-SNAP进行3D可视化。使用人机协同方法结合U-Mamba架构优化分割结果。

Result: U-Mamba模型表现出色：全器官DSC 0.97±0.013，纤维腺体组织0.96±0.024，肿瘤0.82±0.12。生成的3D重建能够可视化复杂解剖特征，临床访谈显示改善了规划、导航和决策支持。

Conclusion: 这种人机协同机器学习方法成功实现了跨患者数据集的3D重建和解剖分割算法泛化，为临床医生提供了增强的可视化工具，改善了术前规划，并通过3D可视化提升了患者教育和沟通效果。

Abstract: Effective preoperative planning requires accurate algorithms for segmenting
anatomical structures across diverse datasets, but traditional models struggle
with generalization. This study presents a novel machine learning methodology
to improve algorithm generalization for 3D anatomical reconstruction beyond
breast cancer applications. We processed 120 retrospective breast MRIs (January
2018-June 2023) through three phases: anonymization and manual segmentation of
T1-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences; co-registration and
segmentation of whole breast, fibroglandular tissue, and tumors; and 3D
visualization using ITK-SNAP. A human-in-the-loop approach refined
segmentations using U-Mamba, designed to generalize across imaging scenarios.
Dice similarity coefficient assessed overlap between automated segmentation and
ground truth. Clinical relevance was evaluated through clinician and patient
interviews. U-Mamba showed strong performance with DSC values of 0.97
($\pm$0.013) for whole organs, 0.96 ($\pm$0.024) for fibroglandular tissue, and
0.82 ($\pm$0.12) for tumors on T1-weighted images. The model generated accurate
3D reconstructions enabling visualization of complex anatomical features.
Clinician interviews indicated improved planning, intraoperative navigation,
and decision support. Integration of 3D visualization enhanced patient
education, communication, and understanding. This human-in-the-loop machine
learning approach successfully generalizes algorithms for 3D reconstruction and
anatomical segmentation across patient datasets, offering enhanced
visualization for clinicians, improved preoperative planning, and more
effective patient education, facilitating shared decision-making and empowering
informed patient choices across medical applications.

### [2] [RU-Net for Automatic Characterization of TRISO Fuel Cross Sections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12244)
*Lu Cai,Fei Xu,Min Xian,Yalei Tang,Shoukun Sun,John Stempien*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用卷积神经网络自动分割辐照后TRISO燃料颗粒的微观截面图像，以替代人工分析，提高分析效率和客观性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 辐照过程中TRISO燃料颗粒会出现内核膨胀和缓冲层致密化等现象，传统人工显微镜分析耗时且主观性强，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 构建包含2000多张辐照TRISO颗粒微观图像的数据集，使用RU-Net、U-Net、ResNet和Attention U-Net等CNN架构进行自动图像分割。

Result: 基于RU-Net的模型在IoU指标上表现最佳，能够显著加速TRISO颗粒截面分析并提高分割结果的客观性。

Conclusion: CNN方法可以有效替代人工分析TRISO燃料颗粒的辐照后形态变化，大幅减少人工工作量并提高分析结果的客观准确性。

Abstract: During irradiation, phenomena such as kernel swelling and buffer
densification may impact the performance of tristructural isotropic (TRISO)
particle fuel. Post-irradiation microscopy is often used to identify these
irradiation-induced morphologic changes. However, each fuel compact generally
contains thousands of TRISO particles. Manually performing the work to get
statistical information on these phenomena is cumbersome and subjective. To
reduce the subjectivity inherent in that process and to accelerate data
analysis, we used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically segment
cross-sectional images of microscopic TRISO layers. CNNs are a class of
machine-learning algorithms specifically designed for processing structured
grid data. They have gained popularity in recent years due to their remarkable
performance in various computer vision tasks, including image classification,
object detection, and image segmentation. In this research, we generated a
large irradiated TRISO layer dataset with more than 2,000 microscopic images of
cross-sectional TRISO particles and the corresponding annotated images. Based
on these annotated images, we used different CNNs to automatically segment
different TRISO layers. These CNNs include RU-Net (developed in this study), as
well as three existing architectures: U-Net, Residual Network (ResNet), and
Attention U-Net. The preliminary results show that the model based on RU-Net
performs best in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU). Using CNN models, we
can expedite the analysis of TRISO particle cross sections, significantly
reducing the manual labor involved and improving the objectivity of the
segmentation results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出分层管道用于作物异常检测和状态估计，使用自编码器进行早期预警，比较了植被指数+随机森林与原始图像+Vision Transformer两种方法，在效率和准确性间取得平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前养分管理方法分析时间长无法实时优化，成像技术计算量大难以在资源受限环境下部署，需要开发高效准确的作物监测方案

Method: 使用多光谱成像数据，构建分层管道：自编码器用于异常检测，比较植被指数+随机森林和原始图像+Vision Transformer两种状态估计方法

Result: 异常检测效率高（73% T3样本在第9天检测到），能耗低于浪费氮肥的隐含能量。ViT在磷和钙估计上优于RF但能耗更高

Conclusion: 模块化管道为边缘诊断和农业可持续发展提供了实用机会，在效率与准确性间提供了可选择的权衡方案

Abstract: Efficient nutrient management is critical for crop growth and sustainable
resource consumption (e.g., nitrogen, energy). Current approaches require
lengthy analyses, preventing real-time optimization; similarly, imaging
facilitates rapid phenotyping but can be computationally intensive, preventing
deployment under resource constraints. This study proposes a flexible, tiered
pipeline for anomaly detection and status estimation (fresh weight, dry mass,
and tissue nutrients), including a comprehensive energy analysis of approaches
that span the efficiency-accuracy spectrum. Using a nutrient depletion
experiment with three treatments (T1-100%, T2-50%, and T3-25% fertilizer
strength) and multispectral imaging (MSI), we developed a hierarchical pipeline
using an autoencoder (AE) for early warning. Further, we compared two status
estimation modules of different complexity for more detailed analysis:
vegetation index (VI) features with machine learning (Random Forest, RF) and
raw whole-image deep learning (Vision Transformer, ViT). Results demonstrated
high-efficiency anomaly detection (73% net detection of T3 samples 9 days after
transplanting) at substantially lower energy than embodied energy in wasted
nitrogen. The state estimation modules show trade-offs, with ViT outperforming
RF on phosphorus and calcium estimation (R2 0.61 vs. 0.58, 0.48 vs. 0.35) at
higher energy cost. With our modular pipeline, this work opens opportunities
for edge diagnostics and practical opportunities for agricultural
sustainability.

### [4] [Humor in Pixels: Benchmarking Large Multimodal Models Understanding of Online Comics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12248)
*Yuriel Ryan,Rui Yang Tan,Kenny Tsu Wei Choo,Roy Ka-Wei Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixelHumor是一个包含2800个标注多格漫画的基准数据集，用于评估大型多模态模型理解多模态幽默和识别叙事序列的能力，实验显示当前最先进模型在面板排序任务上仅达到61%准确率，远低于人类表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幽默理解是社会智能的核心方面，但对大型多模态模型(LMMs)仍是一个重大挑战，需要开发更好的评估框架来推动模型在自然、社会感知交互方面的发展。

Method: 引入PixelHumor基准数据集，包含2800个标注的多格漫画，通过实验评估最先进LMMs在多模态幽默理解和叙事序列识别方面的表现。

Result: 实验结果显示当前顶级模型在面板排序任务上仅达到61%准确率，远低于人类表现，表明当前模型在整合视觉和文本线索进行连贯叙事和幽默理解方面存在严重局限。

Conclusion: PixelHumor为评估多模态上下文和叙事推理提供了一个严谨框架，旨在推动开发能够更好参与自然、社会感知交互的LMMs。

Abstract: Understanding humor is a core aspect of social intelligence, yet it remains a
significant challenge for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). We introduce
PixelHumor, a benchmark dataset of 2,800 annotated multi-panel comics designed
to evaluate LMMs' ability to interpret multimodal humor and recognize narrative
sequences. Experiments with state-of-the-art LMMs reveal substantial gaps: for
instance, top models achieve only 61% accuracy in panel sequencing, far below
human performance. This underscores critical limitations in current models'
integration of visual and textual cues for coherent narrative and humor
understanding. By providing a rigorous framework for evaluating multimodal
contextual and narrative reasoning, PixelHumor aims to drive the development of
LMMs that better engage in natural, socially aware interactions.

### [5] [OnlineHOI: Towards Online Human-Object Interaction Generation and Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12250)
*Yihong Ji,Yunze Liu,Yiyao Zhuo,Weijiang Yu,Fei Ma,Joshua Huang,Fei Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了在线人-物交互(HOI)生成与感知任务，并基于Mamba框架开发了OnlineHOI网络架构，通过内存机制整合历史信息，在多个在线任务上取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前HOI方法都是离线设置，可以从整个交互序列获取信息，但真实世界场景中每个时间步只能获取当前和历史的在线信息，离线方法在在线环境下表现不佳。

Method: 基于Mamba框架构建OnlineHOI网络架构，采用内存机制来有效整合历史信息，利用Mamba对流数据的强大建模能力。

Result: 在Core4D和OAKINK2在线生成任务以及在线HOI4D感知任务上取得了state-of-the-art的结果。

Conclusion: 提出的在线HOI任务和OnlineHOI框架有效解决了真实世界在线交互场景的挑战，为机器人、AR/VR等领域提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The perception and generation of Human-Object Interaction (HOI) are crucial
for fields such as robotics, AR/VR, and human behavior understanding. However,
current approaches model this task in an offline setting, where information at
each time step can be drawn from the entire interaction sequence. In contrast,
in real-world scenarios, the information available at each time step comes only
from the current moment and historical data, i.e., an online setting. We find
that offline methods perform poorly in an online context. Based on this
observation, we propose two new tasks: Online HOI Generation and Perception. To
address this task, we introduce the OnlineHOI framework, a network architecture
based on the Mamba framework that employs a memory mechanism. By leveraging
Mamba's powerful modeling capabilities for streaming data and the Memory
mechanism's efficient integration of historical information, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on the Core4D and OAKINK2 online generation tasks, as
well as the online HOI4D perception task.

### [6] [EfficientNet-Based Multi-Class Detection of Real, Deepfake, and Plastic Surgery Faces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12258)
*Li Kun,Milena Radenkovic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了深度学习技术特别是Deepfake技术在社会应用中的双重影响，既带来了技术进步，也产生了隐私泄露、名誉损害和国家安全风险等严重社会问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨深度学习技术（特别是Deepfake技术）在社会应用中的利弊平衡，分析其对社会各个层面的潜在风险和负面影响，旨在提高对该技术滥用问题的认识。

Method: 通过文献综述和分析，系统梳理Deepfake技术的应用现状、技术特点及其在社会各个领域（如隐私保护、政治选举、国家安全等）产生的具体影响。

Result: 研究发现Deepfake技术能够生成难以辨别的伪造图像和视频，严重影响面部识别系统的功能，对个人隐私、名人声誉和国家安全构成重大威胁，并在政治选举中可能被用于操纵公众舆论。

Conclusion: 深度学习技术特别是Deepfake技术具有双重性，在带来技术进步的同时也产生了严重的社会风险，需要加强监管和技术防范措施来应对其滥用问题。

Abstract: Currently, deep learning has been utilised to tackle several difficulties in
our everyday lives. It not only exhibits progress in computer vision but also
constitutes the foundation for several revolutionary technologies. Nonetheless,
similar to all phenomena, the use of deep learning in diverse domains has
produced a multifaceted interaction of advantages and disadvantages for human
society. Deepfake technology has advanced, significantly impacting social life.
However, developments in this technology can affect privacy, the reputations of
prominent personalities, and national security via software development. It can
produce indistinguishable counterfeit photographs and films, potentially
impairing the functionality of facial recognition systems, so presenting a
significant risk.
  The improper application of deepfake technology produces several detrimental
effects on society. Face-swapping programs mislead users by altering persons'
appearances or expressions to fulfil particular aims or to appropriate personal
information. Deepfake technology permeates daily life through such techniques.
Certain individuals endeavour to sabotage election campaigns or subvert
prominent political figures by creating deceptive pictures to influence public
perception, causing significant harm to a nation's political and economic
structure.

### [7] [A Modern Look at Simplicity Bias in Image Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12265)
*Xiaoguang Chang,Teng Wang,Changyin Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了CLIP模型中的简单性偏置(SB)与图像分类任务性能的关系，提出了频率感知的复杂性度量方法，并发现SB强度与不同任务性能存在相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络简单性偏置(SB)影响泛化能力，但现有研究多关注小模型或合成任务，大型模型中的SB测量及其与图像分类任务的关系尚不清楚。

Method: 1) 理论分析现有复杂性度量的局限性；2) 提出频率感知的复杂性度量方法；3) 在CLIP模型上应用两种SB调制方法进行验证；4) 分析SB与零样本和微调设置下图像分类任务性能的关系。

Result: 新提出的度量方法比现有方法更具信息性和一致性；SB强度与性能存在任务相关性：更强的SB在分布外泛化上表现更好，但在对抗鲁棒性上表现较差。

Conclusion: 模型归纳偏置与目标任务特性的对齐很重要，SB的适当调节可以针对不同任务优化模型性能。

Abstract: The simplicity Bias (SB) of neural networks, i.e.\ their tendency to
represent simple functions, is a key factor in their generalization
capabilities. Recent studies show that an excessive SB may harm performance on
complex tasks, and the need for this bias varies across tasks. Many of these
studies focus on simple models or synthetic tasks. It remains challenging to
measure the SB in large models and little is known about the relevance of the
SB to various image classification tasks.
  In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the SB in CLIP models
and their performance across image classification tasks. First, we
theoretically analyze the potential limitation of existing measures of
complexity that have been used to characterize small models. To address this,
we propose a frequency-aware measure capturing finer-grained SB differences. We
validate this measure on CLIP models subjected to two recent SB-modulation
methods, demonstrating that it is more informative and consistent than previous
measures. Second, we examine the relation between the SB of those models and
their performance across a range of image classification tasks, including
zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. These experiments reveal a range of
behaviors. For example, a stronger SB correlates with a better performance on
OOD generalization than on adversarial robustness. These results highlight the
benefits of aligning a model's inductive biases with the characteristics of the
target task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GraphDerm是一个基于群体图神经网络的多类别皮肤镜分类框架，首次在ISIC规模上融合图像、毫米级校准和元数据，显著优于仅使用图像的基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的皮肤镜AI诊断主要依赖图像数据，忽略了患者元数据（年龄、性别、部位）和物理尺度信息，而几何分析需要精确的毫米级校准

Method: 使用U-Net进行病变和标尺分割，通过1D-CNN回归像素-毫米比例，计算真实尺度描述符，构建包含图像特征、元数据和几何相似性的图结构，使用谱GNN进行半监督节点分类

Result: 标尺和病变分割Dice分别达到0.904和0.908，尺度回归MAE为1.5像素。图模型AUC达到0.9812，稀疏图（25%边）保持AUC 0.9788，显著优于图像基线（AUC 0.9440）

Conclusion: 融合校准尺度、病变几何和元数据的群体图方法在ISIC-2019上取得显著提升，稀疏图保持接近最优精度，尺度感知的图AI是皮肤镜决策支持的有前景方向

Abstract: Introduction. Dermoscopy aids melanoma triage, yet image-only AI often
ignores patient metadata (age, sex, site) and the physical scale needed for
geometric analysis. We present GraphDerm, a population-graph framework that
fuses imaging, millimeter-scale calibration, and metadata for multiclass
dermoscopic classification, to the best of our knowledge the first ISIC-scale
application of GNNs to dermoscopy. Methods. We curate ISIC 2018/2019,
synthesize ruler-embedded images with exact masks, and train U-Nets
(SE-ResNet-18) for lesion and ruler segmentation. Pixels-per-millimeter are
regressed from the ruler-mask two-point correlation via a lightweight 1D-CNN.
From lesion masks we compute real-scale descriptors (area, perimeter, radius of
gyration). Node features use EfficientNet-B3; edges encode metadata/geometry
similarity (fully weighted or thresholded). A spectral GNN performs
semi-supervised node classification; an image-only ANN is the baseline.
Results. Ruler and lesion segmentation reach Dice 0.904 and 0.908; scale
regression attains MAE 1.5 px (RMSE 6.6). The graph attains AUC 0.9812, with a
thresholded variant using about 25% of edges preserving AUC 0.9788 (vs. 0.9440
for the image-only baseline); per-class AUCs typically fall in the 0.97-0.99
range. Conclusion. Unifying calibrated scale, lesion geometry, and metadata in
a population graph yields substantial gains over image-only pipelines on
ISIC-2019. Sparser graphs retain near-optimal accuracy, suggesting efficient
deployment. Scale-aware, graph-based AI is a promising direction for
dermoscopic decision support; future work will refine learned edge semantics
and evaluate on broader curated benchmarks.

### [9] [PATIMT-Bench: A Multi-Scenario Benchmark for Position-Aware Text Image Machine Translation in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12278)
*Wanru Zhuang,Wenbo Li,Zhibin Lan,Xu Han,Peng Li,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出位置感知文本图像机器翻译(PATIMT)任务，构建包含10个真实场景的基准数据集PATIMTBench，通过自适应OCR优化管道提升文本识别质量，在紧凑型大视觉语言模型上实现最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本图像翻译研究主要关注全图像翻译，忽略了位置信息和边界框标注，且覆盖场景有限。本文旨在扩展传统TIMT任务，支持细粒度、保持布局的翻译，具有重要实用价值但尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出PATIMT任务，包含区域特定翻译和带定位的全图像翻译两个子任务。构建PATIMTBench基准数据集，采用自适应图像OCR优化管道，根据场景自适应选择OCR工具并优化文本丰富图像的识别结果。构建包含1200个高质量实例的人工标注测试集。

Result: 在构建的数据集上微调后，紧凑型大视觉语言模型在两个子任务上都达到了最先进的性能。实验结果证明了训练数据的可扩展性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 本文成功扩展了传统文本图像翻译任务，提出了位置感知的PATIMT任务并构建了相应的基准数据集，通过自适应OCR优化和高质量标注数据，显著提升了模型在细粒度文本图像翻译任务上的性能。

Abstract: Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT) aims to translate texts embedded within
an image into another language. Current TIMT studies primarily focus on
providing translations for all the text within an image, while neglecting to
provide bounding boxes and covering limited scenarios. In this work, we extend
traditional TIMT into position-aware TIMT (PATIMT), aiming to support
fine-grained and layoutpreserving translation, which holds great practical
value but remains largely unexplored. This task comprises two key sub-tasks:
regionspecific translation and full-image translation with grounding. To
support existing models on PATIMT and conduct fair evaluation, we construct the
PATIMT benchmark (PATIMTBench), which consists of 10 diverse real-world
scenarios. Specifically, we introduce an Adaptive Image OCR Refinement
Pipeline, which adaptively selects appropriate OCR tools based on scenario and
refines the results of text-rich images. To ensure evaluation reliability, we
further construct a test set, which contains 1,200 high-quality instances
manually annotated and reviewed by human experts. After fine-tuning on our
data, compact Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both sub-tasks. Experimental results also highlight the
scalability and generalizability of our training data

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SimMemDA框架，通过相似性引导和记忆引导的域自适应方法解决光学图像到SAR图像的跨模态船尾迹检测问题，提升检测精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR图像具有全天候观测能力但特征抽象难标注，光学图像视觉清晰但存在域偏移问题，需要解决跨模态域自适应挑战。

Method: 使用WakeGAN进行风格迁移生成伪SAR图像；设计实例级特征相似性过滤机制；引入特征-置信度记忆库和K近邻置信加权融合策略；采用区域混合训练增强泛化能力。

Result: 实验结果表明SimMemDA方法能够提高跨模态船尾迹检测任务的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效解决了光学到SAR图像的域自适应问题，验证了方法的有效性和可行性。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), with its all-weather and wide-area
observation capabilities, serves as a crucial tool for wake detection. However,
due to its complex imaging mechanism, wake features in SAR images often appear
abstract and noisy, posing challenges for accurate annotation. In contrast,
optical images provide more distinct visual cues, but models trained on optical
data suffer from performance degradation when applied to SAR images due to
domain shift. To address this cross-modal domain adaptation challenge, we
propose a Similarity-Guided and Memory-Guided Domain Adaptation (termed
SimMemDA) framework for unsupervised domain adaptive ship wake detection via
instance-level feature similarity filtering and feature memory guidance.
Specifically, to alleviate the visual discrepancy between optical and SAR
images, we first utilize WakeGAN to perform style transfer on optical images,
generating pseudo-images close to the SAR style. Then, instance-level feature
similarity filtering mechanism is designed to identify and prioritize source
samples with target-like distributions, minimizing negative transfer.
Meanwhile, a Feature-Confidence Memory Bank combined with a K-nearest neighbor
confidence-weighted fusion strategy is introduced to dynamically calibrate
pseudo-labels in the target domain, improving the reliability and stability of
pseudo-labels. Finally, the framework further enhances generalization through
region-mixed training, strategically combining source annotations with
calibrated target pseudo-labels. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed SimMemDA method can improve the accuracy and robustness of cross-modal
ship wake detection tasks, validating the effectiveness and feasibility of the
proposed method.

*Shengjie Kris Liu,Siqin Wang,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Amplifier Air-Transformer的数据驱动、物理引导深度学习方法，用于生成美国本土2公里分辨率、每小时更新的气温数据，填补了气象站和卫星数据的时空空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近地表气温是地球表面的关键物理属性，但现有数据源（气象站连续监测和卫星广域覆盖）都无法提供无缝的时空连续数据，需要一种能够结合两者优势的解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段神经网络方法：1）通过编码年温度循环的神经网络重建被云遮挡的GOES-16地表温度数据；2）利用另一个神经网络将重建的地表温度转换为气温，结合深度学习集合方法进行预测不确定性估计。

Result: 基于777亿个地表温度像素和1.55亿个气象站气温记录（2018-2024年）构建和测试，在站点验证中实现了1.93°C的每小时气温映射精度。

Conclusion: 该方法简化了地表温度重建和气温预测流程，可扩展到其他卫星数据源，实现高时空分辨率下的无缝气温监测，生成的数据已公开提供。

Abstract: Near-surface air temperature is a key physical property of the Earth's
surface. Although weather stations offer continuous monitoring and satellites
provide broad spatial coverage, no single data source offers seamless data in a
spatiotemporal fashion. Here, we propose a data-driven, physics-guided deep
learning approach to generate hourly air temperature data at 2 km resolution
over the contiguous United States. The approach, called Amplifier
Air-Transformer, first reconstructs GOES-16 surface temperature data obscured
by clouds. It does so through a neural network encoded with the annual
temperature cycle, incorporating a linear term to amplify ERA5 temperature
values at finer scales and convolutional layers to capture spatiotemporal
variations. Then, another neural network transforms the reconstructed surface
temperature into air temperature by leveraging its latent relationship with key
Earth surface properties. The approach is further enhanced with predictive
uncertainty estimation through deep ensemble learning to improve reliability.
The proposed approach is built and tested on 77.7 billion surface temperature
pixels and 155 million air temperature records from weather stations across the
contiguous United States (2018-2024), achieving hourly air temperature mapping
accuracy of 1.93 C in station-based validation. The proposed approach
streamlines surface temperature reconstruction and air temperature prediction,
and it can be extended to other satellite sources for seamless air temperature
monitoring at high spatiotemporal resolution. The generated data of this study
can be downloaded at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15252812, and the project

*Anthony Miyaguchi,Chandrasekaran Maruthaiyannan,Charles R. Clark*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，在动物重识别任务中，后处理度量学习的有效性高度依赖于骨干网络嵌入的初始质量和领域特异性。领域专用模型比通用模型更适合进行微调优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在动物重识别任务中，通用预训练模型与领域专用模型在后处理度量学习中的表现差异，以及微调优化对不同类型骨干网络的影响。

Method: 使用DINOv2（通用模型）和MegaDescriptor（领域专用模型）作为骨干网络，采用K近邻分类器进行个体识别，并比较三元组学习投影头对两种模型的性能提升效果。

Result: 领域专用模型MegaDescriptor通过三元组学习获得了0.13分的显著提升，而通用模型DINOv2仅获得0.03分的微小提升。验证损失停滞和可视化分析表明通用模型的流形结构更难针对细粒度任务进行重塑。

Conclusion: 通用预训练特征在专业化、数据有限的重新识别任务中存在关键局限性，领域特异性预训练对于此类任务至关重要。

Abstract: This paper details the DS@GT team's entry for the AnimalCLEF 2025
re-identification challenge. Our key finding is that the effectiveness of
post-hoc metric learning is highly contingent on the initial quality and
domain-specificity of the backbone embeddings. We compare a general-purpose
model (DINOv2) with a domain-specific model (MegaDescriptor) as a backbone. A
K-Nearest Neighbor classifier with robust thresholding then identifies known
individuals or flags new ones. While a triplet-learning projection head
improved the performance of the specialized MegaDescriptor model by 0.13
points, it yielded minimal gains (0.03) for the general-purpose DINOv2 on
averaged BAKS and BAUS. We demonstrate that the general-purpose manifold is
more difficult to reshape for fine-grained tasks, as evidenced by stagnant
validation loss and qualitative visualizations. This work highlights the
critical limitations of refining general-purpose features for specialized,
limited-data re-ID tasks and underscores the importance of domain-specific
pre-training. The implementation for this work is publicly available at
github.com/dsgt-arc/animalclef-2025.

TL;DR: 提出GhostNetV3-Small架构，针对低分辨率输入优化，在CIFAR-10上达到93.94%准确率，发现架构调整比知识蒸馏更有效


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在边缘设备上部署面临计算资源限制，需要压缩和适配模型以实现高效推理

Method: 基于GhostNetV3架构开发GhostNetV3-Small变体，并比较传统知识蒸馏、教师助手和教师集成等蒸馏技术

Result: GhostNetV3-Small在CIFAR-10上显著优于原版GhostNetV3，但所有蒸馏策略都导致准确率下降

Conclusion: 在小规模图像分类任务中，架构适配比蒸馏技术更有效，需要在低分辨率领域进一步研究模型设计和高级蒸馏技术

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across a range of
tasks, however their computational demands often make them unsuitable for
deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper explores strategies
for compressing and adapting models to enable efficient inference in such
environments. We focus on GhostNetV3, a state-of-the-art architecture for
mobile applications, and propose GhostNetV3-Small, a modified variant designed
to perform better on low-resolution inputs such as those in the CIFAR-10
dataset. In addition to architectural adaptation, we provide a comparative
evaluation of knowledge distillation techniques, including traditional
knowledge distillation, teacher assistants, and teacher ensembles. Experimental
results show that GhostNetV3-Small significantly outperforms the original
GhostNetV3 on CIFAR-10, achieving an accuracy of 93.94%. Contrary to
expectations, all examined distillation strategies led to reduced accuracy
compared to baseline training. These findings indicate that architectural
adaptation can be more impactful than distillation in small-scale image
classification tasks, highlighting the need for further research on effective
model design and advanced distillation techniques for low-resolution domains.

Abstract: Accurate mapping of individual trees is essential for ecological monitoring
and forest management. Orthomosaic imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
is widely used, but stitching artifacts and heavy preprocessing limit its
suitability for field deployment. This study explores the use of raw UAV
imagery for palm detection and crown-center localization in tropical forests.
Two research questions are addressed: (1) how detection performance varies
across orthomosaic and raw imagery, including within-domain and cross-domain
transfer, and (2) to what extent crown-center annotations improve localization
accuracy beyond bounding-box centroids. Using state-of-the-art detectors and
keypoint models, we show that raw imagery yields superior performance in
deployment-relevant scenarios, while orthomosaics retain value for robust
cross-domain generalization. Incorporating crown-center annotations in training
further improves localization and provides precise tree positions for
downstream ecological analyses. These findings offer practical guidance for
UAV-based biodiversity and conservation monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MechBench数据集和DYNAMO模型，用于从CAD点云预测齿轮组件的运动轨迹，解决了机械装配体中几何耦合运动分析的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对日常铰接物体的运动分析通常假设简化运动结构或依赖关节标注，但机械装配体（如齿轮）的运动来自几何耦合（啮合齿或对齐轴），难以仅从几何形状推理关系运动。

Method: 创建了包含693个合成齿轮组件的MechBench基准数据集，提供零件级真实运动轨迹；提出了DYNAMO模型，这是一个依赖感知的神经模型，直接从分割的CAD点云预测每个零件的SE(3)运动轨迹。

Result: 实验表明DYNAMO优于强基线方法，在不同齿轮配置下实现了准确且时间一致的运动预测。

Conclusion: MechBench和DYNAMO共同建立了一个新颖的系统框架，用于数据驱动的CAD装配体中耦合机械运动学习。

Abstract: Understanding the motion of articulated mechanical assemblies from static
geometry remains a core challenge in 3D perception and design automation. Prior
work on everyday articulated objects such as doors and laptops typically
assumes simplified kinematic structures or relies on joint annotations.
However, in mechanical assemblies like gears, motion arises from geometric
coupling, through meshing teeth or aligned axes, making it difficult for
existing methods to reason about relational motion from geometry alone. To
address this gap, we introduce MechBench, a benchmark dataset of 693 diverse
synthetic gear assemblies with part-wise ground-truth motion trajectories.
MechBench provides a structured setting to study coupled motion, where part
dynamics are induced by contact and transmission rather than predefined joints.
Building on this, we propose DYNAMO, a dependency-aware neural model that
predicts per-part SE(3) motion trajectories directly from segmented CAD point
clouds. Experiments show that DYNAMO outperforms strong baselines, achieving
accurate and temporally consistent predictions across varied gear
configurations. Together, MechBench and DYNAMO establish a novel systematic
framework for data-driven learning of coupled mechanical motion in CAD
assemblies.

Conclusion: Cott-ADNet是准确高效的田间部署解决方案，为自动化棉花采摘和高通量表型分析提供了可靠基础，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Cotton is one of the most important natural fiber crops worldwide, yet
harvesting remains limited by labor-intensive manual picking, low efficiency,
and yield losses from missing the optimal harvest window. Accurate recognition
of cotton bolls and their maturity is therefore essential for automation, yield
estimation, and breeding research. We propose Cott-ADNet, a lightweight
real-time detector tailored to cotton boll and flower recognition under complex
field conditions. Building on YOLOv11n, Cott-ADNet enhances spatial
representation and robustness through improved convolutional designs, while
introducing two new modules: a NeLU-enhanced Global Attention Mechanism to
better capture weak and low-contrast features, and a Dilated Receptive Field
SPPF to expand receptive fields for more effective multi-scale context modeling
at low computational cost. We curate a labeled dataset of 4,966 images, and
release an external validation set of 1,216 field images to support future
research. Experiments show that Cott-ADNet achieves 91.5% Precision, 89.8%
Recall, 93.3% mAP50, 71.3% mAP, and 90.6% F1-Score with only 7.5 GFLOPs,
maintaining stable performance under multi-scale and rotational variations.
These results demonstrate Cott-ADNet as an accurate and efficient solution for
in-field deployment, and thus provide a reliable basis for automated cotton
harvesting and high-throughput phenotypic analysis. Code and dataset is

Abstract: Point cloud processing as a fundamental task in the field of geomatics and
computer vision, has been supporting tasks and applications at different scales
from air to ground, including mapping, environmental monitoring, urban/tree
structure modeling, automated driving, robotics, disaster responses etc. Due to
the rapid development of deep learning, point cloud processing algorithms have
nowadays been almost explicitly dominated by learning-based approaches, most of
which are yet transitioned into real-world practices. Existing surveys
primarily focus on the ever-updating network architecture to accommodate
unordered point clouds, largely ignoring their practical values in typical
point cloud processing applications, in which extra-large volume of data,
diverse scene contents, varying point density, data modality need to be
considered. In this paper, we provide a meta review on deep learning approaches
and datasets that cover a selection of critical tasks of point cloud processing
in use such as scene completion, registration, semantic segmentation, and
modeling. By reviewing a broad range of urban and environmental applications
these tasks can support, we identify gaps to be closed as these methods
transformed into applications and draw concluding remarks in both the
algorithmic and practical aspects of the surveyed methods.

Abstract: Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide.
Glaucoma prognosis is essential for identifying at-risk patients and enabling
timely intervention to prevent blindness. Many existing approaches rely on
historical sequential data but are constrained by fixed-length inputs, limiting
their flexibility. Additionally, traditional glaucoma prognosis methods often
employ end-to-end models, which struggle with the limited size of glaucoma
datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a Two-Stage Decoupling
Framework (TSDF) for variable-length glaucoma prognosis. In the first stage, we
employ a feature representation module that leverages self-supervised learning
to aggregate multiple glaucoma datasets for training, disregarding differences
in their supervisory information. This approach enables datasets of varying
sizes to learn better feature representations. In the second stage, we
introduce a temporal aggregation module that incorporates an attention-based
mechanism to process sequential inputs of varying lengths, ensuring flexible
and efficient utilization of all available data. This design significantly
enhances model performance while maintaining a compact parameter size.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark glaucoma datasets:the Ocular
Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) and the Glaucoma Real-world Appraisal
Progression Ensemble (GRAPE),which differ significantly in scale and clinical
settings,demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的tokenizer训练方案，包括主训练和后训练，通过模拟生成过程中的噪声和优化解码器，显著提升了生成质量和收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像tokenizer只关注重建任务，忽视了生成推理过程中的分布差异问题，导致重建分布与生成分布之间存在显著差异。

Method: 提出主训练阶段使用潜在扰动策略模拟采样噪声，后训练阶段针对训练好的生成模型优化tokenizer解码器，并提出了新的评估指标pFID。

Result: 使用约4亿参数的生成器，经过主训练的tokenizer达到1.60 gFID，后训练后进一步提升至1.36 gFID，在各种tokenizer和生成器上都验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过综合考虑重建和生成任务，有效解决了tokenizer在生成模型中的分布差异问题，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Recent image generative models typically capture the image distribution in a
pre-constructed latent space, relying on a frozen image tokenizer. However,
there exists a significant discrepancy between the reconstruction and
generation distribution, where current tokenizers only prioritize the
reconstruction task that happens before generative training without considering
the generation errors during sampling. In this paper, we comprehensively
analyze the reason for this discrepancy in a discrete latent space, and, from
which, we propose a novel tokenizer training scheme including both
main-training and post-training, focusing on improving latent space
construction and decoding respectively. During the main training, a latent
perturbation strategy is proposed to simulate sampling noises, \ie, the
unexpected tokens generated in generative inference. Specifically, we propose a
plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme, which significantly enhances the
robustness of tokenizer, thus boosting the generation quality and convergence
speed, and a novel tokenizer evaluation metric, \ie, pFID, which successfully
correlates the tokenizer performance to generation quality. During
post-training, we further optimize the tokenizer decoder regarding a
well-trained generative model to mitigate the distribution difference between
generated and reconstructed tokens. With a $\sim$400M generator, a discrete
tokenizer trained with our proposed main training achieves a notable 1.60 gFID
and further obtains 1.36 gFID with the additional post-training. Further
experiments are conducted to broadly validate the effectiveness of our
post-training strategy on off-the-shelf discrete and continuous tokenizers,
coupled with autoregressive and diffusion-based generators.

TL;DR: 本文提出了GRT（Generalizable Radar Transformer）基础模型，使用100万样本的大规模毫米波雷达数据集，能够实现高质量的3D占用和语义分割，在多种任务和场景中表现出良好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波雷达虽然成本低、耐用且不受环境条件影响，但角分辨率较差。现有方法缺乏标准化的基础模型和大规模数据集，通常需要从头训练任务特定模型。

Method: 收集了100万样本的大型原始雷达数据集，训练了基于Transformer的GRT基础模型，使用原始雷达数据而非传统的有损表示，支持3D占用预测和语义分割任务。

Result: GRT在多样场景中表现出良好的泛化能力，可以微调适应不同任务，数据规模每增加10倍性能提升20%。使用原始数据相比传统表示相当于10倍数据量的提升。

Conclusion: 证明了大规模数据集和基础模型对毫米波雷达感知的重要性，估计需要约1亿样本（3000小时）数据才能充分发挥GRT的潜力。

Abstract: mmWave radars are compact, inexpensive, and durable sensors that are robust
to occlusions and work regardless of environmental conditions, such as weather
and darkness. However, this comes at the cost of poor angular resolution,
especially for inexpensive single-chip radars, which are typically used in
automotive and indoor sensing applications. Although many have proposed
learning-based methods to mitigate this weakness, no standardized foundational
models or large datasets for the mmWave radar have emerged, and practitioners
have largely trained task-specific models from scratch using relatively small
datasets.
  In this paper, we collect (to our knowledge) the largest available raw radar
dataset with 1M samples (29 hours) and train a foundational model for 4D
single-chip radar, which can predict 3D occupancy and semantic segmentation
with quality that is typically only possible with much higher resolution
sensors. We demonstrate that our Generalizable Radar Transformer (GRT)
generalizes across diverse settings, can be fine-tuned for different tasks, and
shows logarithmic data scaling of 20\% per $10\times$ data. We also run
extensive ablations on common design decisions, and find that using raw radar
data significantly outperforms widely-used lossy representations, equivalent to
a $10\times$ increase in training data. Finally, we roughly estimate that
$\approx$100M samples (3000 hours) of data are required to fully exploit the
potential of GRT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但其在噪声条件下的鲁棒性尚未得到充分研究，需要建立标准化评估框架

Method: 使用受控扰动（光照变化、运动模糊、压缩伪影）测试多个SOTA VLMs，结合词汇指标（BLEU、METEOR等）和神经相似性度量进行语义对齐量化

Result: 发现：1）标注质量显著影响性能；2）大模型如LLaVA在语义理解上优秀但不总是优于小模型；3）JPEG压缩和运动模糊等噪声类型会大幅降低所有模型性能

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型大小、数据集特性和噪声鲁棒性之间的微妙权衡关系，为未来鲁棒多模态学习提供了标准化基准

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have attained exceptional success across
multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.
However, their robustness under noisy conditions remains unfamiliar. In this
study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework to evaluate the
performance of several state-of-the-art VLMs under controlled perturbations,
including lighting variation, motion blur, and compression artifacts. We used
both lexical-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CIDEr) and neural-based
similarity measures using sentence embeddings to quantify semantic alignment.
Our experiments span diverse datasets, revealing key insights: (1)
descriptiveness of ground-truth captions significantly influences model
performance; (2) larger models like LLaVA excel in semantic understanding but
do not universally outperform smaller models; and (3) certain noise types, such
as JPEG compression and motion blur, dramatically degrade performance across
models. Our findings highlight the nuanced trade-offs between model size,
dataset characteristics, and noise resilience, offering a standardized
benchmark for future robust multimodal learning.

Conclusion: IG-CAM为弱监督语义分割设立了新基准，在像素级标注不可用或成本过高的情况下提供实用解决方案，具有优越的定位精度和计算效率

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) addresses the challenge of
training segmentation models using only image-level annotations, eliminating
the need for expensive pixel-level labeling. While existing methods struggle
with precise object boundary localization and often focus only on the most
discriminative regions, we propose IG-CAM (Instance-Guided Class Activation
Mapping), a novel approach that leverages instance-level cues and influence
functions to generate high-quality, boundary-aware localization maps. Our
method introduces three key innovations: (1) Instance-Guided Refinement that
uses ground truth segmentation masks to guide CAM generation, ensuring complete
object coverage rather than just discriminative parts; (2) Influence Function
Integration that captures the relationship between training samples and model
predictions, leading to more robust feature representations; and (3)
Multi-Scale Boundary Enhancement that employs progressive refinement strategies
to achieve sharp, precise object boundaries. IG-CAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset with an mIoU of 82.3% before
post-processing, which further improves to 86.6% after applying Conditional
Random Field (CRF) refinement, significantly outperforming previous WSSS
methods. Our approach demonstrates superior localization accuracy, with
complete object coverage and precise boundary delineation, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Extensive ablation studies validate the contribution
of each component, and qualitative comparisons across 600 diverse images
showcase the method's robustness and generalization capability. The results
establish IG-CAM as a new benchmark for weakly supervised semantic
segmentation, offering a practical solution for scenarios where pixel-level
annotations are unavailable or prohibitively expensive.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for generating artist-style meshes from
noisy or incomplete point clouds, such as those captured by real-world sensors
like LiDAR or mobile RGB-D cameras. Artist-created meshes are crucial for
commercial graphics pipelines due to their compatibility with animation and
texturing tools and their efficiency in rendering. However, existing approaches
often assume clean, complete inputs or rely on complex multi-stage pipelines,
limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we
propose an end-to-end method that refines the input point cloud and directly
produces high-quality, artist-style meshes. At the core of our approach is a
novel reformulation of 3D point cloud refinement as a 2D inpainting task,
enabling the use of powerful generative models. Preliminary results on the
ShapeNet dataset demonstrate the promise of our framework in producing clean,
complete meshes.

Analysis (PCA) to perform robust diameter estimation. By mitigating the effects
of curvature, occlusion, and image noise, this approach offers a scalable and
reliable solution to support high-throughput phenotyping in breeding and

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, the performance of
deep learning often deteriorates in FL due to decentralized and heterogeneous
data. This challenge is further amplified in multi-label scenarios, where data
exhibit complex characteristics such as label co-occurrence, inter-label
dependency, and discrepancies between local and global label relationships.
While most existing FL research primarily focuses on single-label
classification, many real-world applications, particularly in domains such as
medical imaging, often involve multi-label settings. In this paper, we address
this important yet underexplored scenario in FL, where clients hold multi-label
data with skewed label distributions. Neural Collapse (NC) describes a
geometric structure in the latent feature space where features of each class
collapse to their class mean with vanishing intra-class variance, and the class
means form a maximally separated configuration. Motivated by this theory, we
propose a method to align feature distributions across clients and to learn
high-quality, well-clustered representations. To make the NC-structure
applicable to multi-label settings, where image-level features may contain
multiple semantic concepts, we introduce a feature disentanglement module that
extracts semantically specific features. The clustering of these disentangled
class-wise features is guided by a predefined shared NC structure, which
mitigates potential conflicts between client models due to diverse local data
distributions. In addition, we design regularisation losses to encourage
compact clustering in the latent feature space. Experiments conducted on four
benchmark datasets across eight diverse settings demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing methods, validating its effectiveness in this challenging
FL scenario.

offline benchmarks and real-world efficacy,which we attribute to the ecological
invalidity of training data.This work introduces Agent4FaceForgery to address
two fundamental problems: (1) how to capture the diverse intents and iterative
processes of human forgery creation, and (2) how to model the complex, often
adversarial, text-image interactions that accompany forgeries in social media.
To solve this,we propose a multi-agent framework where LLM-poweredagents,
equipped with profile and memory modules, simulate the forgery creation
process. Crucially, these agents interact in a simulated social environment to
generate samples labeled for nuanced text-image consistency, moving beyond
simple binary classification. An Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS) mechanism
ensures data quality and diversity. Extensive experiments validate that the
data generated by our simulationdriven approach brings significant performance
gains to detectors of multiple architectures, fully demonstrating the
effectiveness and value of our framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出MGNM方法，利用图神经网络显式建模人-物交互关系，通过多模态图网络框架和多层次特征交互机制，在HOI检测任务上取得了state-of-the-art性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer方法在HOI检测中占主导地位，但无法显式建模关系结构，而图神经网络天生适合处理这种关系建模任务。

Method: 设计了四阶段图结构的多模态图网络框架，引入多层次视觉和语言特征交互机制来增强人-物对之间的信息传播。

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO基准测试中达到state-of-the-art性能，与更先进的目标检测器结合时性能显著提升，并在稀有和非稀有类别间保持有效平衡。

Conclusion: MGNM方法通过图神经网络的关系结构建模有效提升了HOI检测性能，证明了GNN在关系建模任务中的优势。

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have recently become the prevailing approach for
Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. However, the Transformer architecture
does not explicitly model the relational structures inherent in HOI detection,
which impedes the recognition of interactions. In contrast, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) are inherently better suited for this task, as they explicitly
model the relationships between human-object pairs. Therefore, in this paper,
we propose \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{G}raph \textbf{N}etwork
\textbf{M}odeling (MGNM) that leverages GNN-based relational structures to
enhance HOI detection. Specifically, we design a multimodal graph network
framework that explicitly models the HOI task in a four-stage graph structure.
Furthermore, we introduce a multi-level feature interaction mechanism within
our graph network. This mechanism leverages multi-level vision and language
features to enhance information propagation across human-object pairs.
Consequently, our proposed MGNM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two
widely used benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO. Moreover, when integrated with a
more advanced object detector, our method demonstrates a significant
performance gain and maintains an effective balance between rare and non-rare
classes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VQT-Light是一个基于VQVAE和ViT架构的轻量级光照估计框架，通过离散特征提取和全局上下文建模，实现了40FPS的推理速度和更好的纹理保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有光照估计方法要么难以恢复光照图的详细纹理，要么在运行速度和纹理保真度方面面临挑战，需要一种既能保持细节又能快速推理的解决方案

Method: 提出两模块框架：1）使用VQVAE提取光照图的离散特征以避免后验坍塌；2）使用ViT而非CNN捕获输入图像的全局上下文和依赖关系，将光照估计建模为多分类任务

Result: 模型实现了40FPS的推理速度，在多个评估指标上均有提升，能够预测具有更丰富纹理和更好保真度的光照图

Conclusion: VQT-Light在定性和定量实验中都优于现有最先进方法，成功解决了光照估计中的纹理细节和速度平衡问题

Abstract: Accurate lighting estimation is a significant yet challenging task in
computer vision and graphics. However, existing methods either struggle to
restore detailed textures of illumination map, or face challenges in running
speed and texture fidelity. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
framework (VQT-Light) based on VQVAE and ViT architecture. VQT-Light includes
two modules: feature extraction and lighting estimation. First, we take
advantages of VQVAE to extract discrete features of illumination map rather
than continuous features to avoid "posterior collapse". Second, we capture
global context and dependencies of input image through ViT rather than CNNs to
improve the prediction of illumination outside the field of view. Combining the
above two modules, we formulate the lighting estimation as a multiclass
classification task, which plays a key role in our pipeline. As a result, our
model predicts light map with richer texture and better fidelity while keeping
lightweight and fast. VQT-Light achieves an inference speed of 40FPS and
improves multiple evaluation metrics. Qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method realizes superior results compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有的一致性蒸馏方法在目标时间步选择上主要依赖确定性或随机策略，需要为不同蒸馏过程专门设计采样调度器，限制了扩散模型在实际应用中的采样灵活性和潜力。

Method: 提出自适应采样调度器，包含三个创新策略：(1)动态目标时间步选择，基于计算的重要性选择时间步；(2)优化交替采样，基于时间步重要性指导前向去噪和后向加噪；(3)使用平滑裁剪和颜色平衡技术实现稳定高质量生成。

Result: 通过综合实验评估验证了自适应采样调度器在各种一致性蒸馏方法中的有效性和灵活性，实验结果表明生成性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了强大的适应性，扩展了一致性蒸馏模型在复杂生成场景中的适用性，显著提高了扩散模型的采样效率和生成质量。

Abstract: Consistent distillation methods have evolved into effective techniques that
significantly accelerate the sampling process of diffusion models. Although
existing methods have achieved remarkable results, the selection of target
timesteps during distillation mainly relies on deterministic or stochastic
strategies, which often require sampling schedulers to be designed specifically
for different distillation processes. Moreover, this pattern severely limits
flexibility, thereby restricting the full sampling potential of diffusion
models in practical applications. To overcome these limitations, this paper
proposes an adaptive sampling scheduler that is applicable to various
consistency distillation frameworks. The scheduler introduces three innovative
strategies: (i) dynamic target timestep selection, which adapts to different
consistency distillation frameworks by selecting timesteps based on their
computed importance; (ii) Optimized alternating sampling along the solution
trajectory by guiding forward denoising and backward noise addition based on
the proposed time step importance, enabling more effective exploration of the
solution space to enhance generation performance; and (iii) Utilization of
smoothing clipping and color balancing techniques to achieve stable and
high-quality generation results at high guidance scales, thereby expanding the
applicability of consistency distillation models in complex generation
scenarios. We validated the effectiveness and flexibility of the adaptive
sampling scheduler across various consistency distillation methods through
comprehensive experimental evaluations. Experimental results consistently
demonstrated significant improvements in generative performance, highlighting
the strong adaptability achieved by our method.

Motivation: 深度学习模型易受对抗攻击，但针对自动驾驶定位的攻击研究较少，现有攻击主要关注3D感知而非定位

Method: 逆向工程定位模型识别关键点，策略性移除包含Top-K关键点的区域，使用近红外吸收材料在物理世界隐藏关键区域

Conclusion: DisorientLiDAR框架验证了LiDAR定位系统的脆弱性，展示了从虚拟到物理世界的可行攻击路径，具有现实安全意义

Abstract: Deep learning models have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks
with visually imperceptible perturbations. Even this poses a serious security
challenge for the localization of self-driving cars, there has been very little
exploration of attack on it, as most of adversarial attacks have been applied
to 3D perception. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack framework
called DisorientLiDAR targeting LiDAR-based localization. By
reverse-engineering localization models (e.g., feature extraction networks),
adversaries can identify critical keypoints and strategically remove them,
thereby disrupting LiDAR-based localization. Our proposal is first evaluated on
three state-of-the-art point-cloud registration models (HRegNet, D3Feat, and
GeoTransformer) using the KITTI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
removing regions containing Top-K keypoints significantly degrades their
registration accuracy. We further validate the attack's impact on the Autoware
autonomous driving platform, where hiding merely a few critical regions induces
noticeable localization drift. Finally, we extended our attacks to the physical
world by hiding critical regions with near-infrared absorptive materials,
thereby successfully replicate the attack effects observed in KITTI data. This
step has been closer toward the realistic physical-world attack that
demonstrate the veracity and generality of our proposal.

Conclusion: 通过光谱学习视角和光谱码本重建，能够有效感知波长差异来区分反射，光谱感知Transformer的联合恢复方法在反射去除任务中表现优异

Abstract: Eliminating reflections caused by incident light interacting with reflective
medium remains an ill-posed problem in the image restoration area. The primary
challenge arises from the overlapping of reflection and transmission components
in the captured images, which complicates the task of accurately distinguishing
and recovering the clean background. Existing approaches typically address
reflection removal solely in the image domain, ignoring the spectral property
variations of reflected light, which hinders their ability to effectively
discern reflections. In this paper, we start with a new perspective on spectral
learning, and propose the Spectral Codebook to reconstruct the optical spectrum
of the reflection image. The reflections can be effectively distinguished by
perceiving the wavelength differences between different light sources in the
spectrum. To leverage the reconstructed spectrum, we design two spectral prior
refinement modules to re-distribute pixels in the spatial dimension and
adaptively enhance the spectral differences along the wavelength dimension.
Furthermore, we present the Spectrum-Aware Transformer to jointly recover the
transmitted content in spectral and pixel domains. Experimental results on
three different reflection benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and
generalization ability of our method compared to state-of-the-art models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗鲁棒性蒸馏方法虽然能提升学生模型的鲁棒性，但会导致清洁样本性能下降。主要原因是双教师框架中优化目标冲突和迭代生成对抗样本导致教师模型性能退化

Method: 提出循环迭代ARD方法(CIARD)：1) 使用多教师框架和对比推拉损失对齐来解决双教师优化目标冲突；2) 采用连续对抗重训练来维持教师模型的动态鲁棒性

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet上，CIARD平均提升对抗防御率3.53%，清洁样本准确率提升5.87%，在平衡模型鲁棒性和泛化性方面建立新基准

Conclusion: CIARD方法有效解决了对抗鲁棒性蒸馏中的性能下降问题，通过创新的多教师框架和动态训练策略，实现了鲁棒性和清洁性能的双重提升

Abstract: Adversarial robustness distillation (ARD) aims to transfer both performance
and robustness from teacher model to lightweight student model, enabling
resilient performance on resource-constrained scenarios. Though existing ARD
approaches enhance student model's robustness, the inevitable by-product leads
to the degraded performance on clean examples. We summarize the causes of this
problem inherent in existing methods with dual-teacher framework as: 1. The
divergent optimization objectives of dual-teacher models, i.e., the clean and
robust teachers, impede effective knowledge transfer to the student model, and
2. The iteratively generated adversarial examples during training lead to
performance deterioration of the robust teacher model. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Cyclic Iterative ARD (CIARD) method with two key
innovations: a. A multi-teacher framework with contrastive push-loss alignment
to resolve conflicts in dual-teacher optimization objectives, and b. Continuous
adversarial retraining to maintain dynamic teacher robustness against
performance degradation from the varying adversarial examples. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that CIARD
achieves remarkable performance with an average 3.53 improvement in adversarial
defense rates across various attack scenarios and a 5.87 increase in clean
sample accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for balancing model robustness
and generalization. Our code is available at https://github.com/eminentgu/CIARD

Motivation: 现有多媒体取证基准存在跨模态不对齐的伪影问题，无法反映真实世界中的语义一致性操纵模式，需要构建更真实的语义协调操纵检测数据集和方法

Conclusion: 通过构建语义对齐的多模态操纵数据集和检索增强检测框架，有效解决了真实世界中语义一致性操纵的检测挑战，为多媒体取证提供了更实用的解决方案

Abstract: The detection and grounding of manipulated content in multimodal data has
emerged as a critical challenge in media forensics. While existing benchmarks
demonstrate technical progress, they suffer from misalignment artifacts that
poorly reflect real-world manipulation patterns: practical attacks typically
maintain semantic consistency across modalities, whereas current datasets
artificially disrupt cross-modal alignment, creating easily detectable
anomalies. To bridge this gap, we pioneer the detection of
semantically-coordinated manipulations where visual edits are systematically
paired with semantically consistent textual descriptions. Our approach begins
with constructing the first Semantic-Aligned Multimodal Manipulation (SAMM)
dataset, generated through a two-stage pipeline: 1) applying state-of-the-art
image manipulations, followed by 2) generation of contextually-plausible
textual narratives that reinforce the visual deception. Building on this
foundation, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Manipulation Detection and
Grounding (RamDG) framework. RamDG commences by harnessing external knowledge
repositories to retrieve contextual evidence, which serves as the auxiliary
texts and encoded together with the inputs through our image forgery grounding
and deep manipulation detection modules to trace all manipulations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving 2.06\% higher detection accuracy on SAMM compared to
state-of-the-art approaches. The dataset and code are publicly available at
https://github.com/shen8424/SAMM-RamDG-CAP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在跨视角地理定位任务中往往忽略空间和语义信息，难以处理显著的外观变化和提取判别性特征，需要更有效的特征表示方法。

Method: 提出MFAF方法，包含多频率分支块(MFB)捕获多尺度的低频结构特征和高频边缘细节，以及频率感知空间注意力(FSA)模块自适应关注频率特征的关键区域。

Result: 在University-1652、SUES-200和Dense-UAV等基准测试中，MFAF方法在无人机定位和导航任务中都取得了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: MFAF方法通过多尺度频率特征提取和注意力机制，有效提升了跨视角地理定位的准确性和鲁棒性，为解决视角变化和背景噪声干扰提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims to determine the geographical location of a
query image by matching it against a gallery of images. This task is
challenging due to the significant appearance variations of objects observed
from variable views, along with the difficulty in extracting discriminative
features. Existing approaches often rely on extracting features through feature
map segmentation while neglecting spatial and semantic information. To address
these issues, we propose the EVA02-based Multi-scale Frequency Attention Fusion
(MFAF) method. The MFAF method consists of Multi-Frequency Branch-wise Block
(MFB) and the Frequency-aware Spatial Attention (FSA) module. The MFB block
effectively captures both low-frequency structural features and high-frequency
edge details across multiple scales, improving the consistency and robustness
of feature representations across various viewpoints. Meanwhile, the FSA module
adaptively focuses on the key regions of frequency features, significantly
mitigating the interference caused by background noise and viewpoint
variability. Extensive experiments on widely recognized benchmarks, including
University-1652, SUES-200, and Dense-UAV, demonstrate that the MFAF method
achieves competitive performance in both drone localization and drone
navigation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文对YOLOv8到YOLOv11四个版本在海洋图像检测任务上的性能进行了系统比较，发现YOLOv9后准确度趋于饱和，而YOLOv10在嵌入式AUV部署中提供最佳的速度-精度平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下自主航行器(AUVs)依赖计算机视觉系统进行海洋监测任务，但水下图像存在光线衰减、浑浊和类别不平衡等问题，且AUV计算资源有限。需要评估YOLO系列检测器在海洋领域的实际性能。

Method: 使用两个公开海洋数据集（珊瑚疾病和鱼类物种），创建四种训练规模（25%-100%图像），在相同超参数下训练YOLOv8-s到YOLOv11-s模型，评估精度、召回率、mAP、推理时间等指标，并进行Grad-CAM可视化分析。

Result: 在两个数据集上，YOLOv9后准确度达到饱和，主要改进在于效率而非精度。推理速度显著提升，YOLOv10在速度和精度之间提供了最佳平衡。

Conclusion: YOLOv10是嵌入式AUV部署的最佳选择，研究提供了首个近期YOLO变体在水下图像上的对照比较，并建立了开放可复现的基准和代码库以加速海洋视觉研究。

Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) increasingly rely on on-board
computer-vision systems for tasks such as habitat mapping, ecological
monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. However, underwater imagery is
hindered by light attenuation, turbidity, and severe class imbalance, while the
computational resources available on AUVs are limited. One-stage detectors from
the YOLO family are attractive because they fuse localization and
classification in a single, low-latency network; however, their terrestrial
benchmarks (COCO, PASCAL-VOC, Open Images) leave open the question of how
successive YOLO releases perform in the marine domain. We curate two openly
available datasets that span contrasting operating conditions: a Coral Disease
set (4,480 images, 18 classes) and a Fish Species set (7,500 images, 20
classes). For each dataset, we create four training regimes (25 %, 50 %, 75 %,
100 % of the images) while keeping balanced validation and test partitions
fixed. We train YOLOv8-s, YOLOv9-s, YOLOv10-s, and YOLOv11-s with identical
hyperparameters (100 epochs, 640 px input, batch = 16, T4 GPU) and evaluate
precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, per-image inference time, and
frames-per-second (FPS). Post-hoc Grad-CAM visualizations probe feature
utilization and localization faithfulness. Across both datasets, accuracy
saturates after YOLOv9, suggesting architectural innovations primarily target
efficiency rather than accuracy. Inference speed, however, improves markedly.
Our results (i) provide the first controlled comparison of recent YOLO variants
on underwater imagery, (ii) show that lightweight YOLOv10 offers the best
speed-accuracy trade-off for embedded AUV deployment, and (iii) deliver an
open, reproducible benchmark and codebase to accelerate future marine-vision
research.

Abstract: Stereo matching plays a crucial role in enabling depth perception for
autonomous driving and robotics. While recent years have witnessed remarkable
progress in stereo matching algorithms, largely driven by learning-based
methods and synthetic datasets, the generalization performance of these models
remains constrained by the limited diversity of existing training data. To
address these challenges, we present StereoCarla, a high-fidelity synthetic
stereo dataset specifically designed for autonomous driving scenarios. Built on
the CARLA simulator, StereoCarla incorporates a wide range of camera
configurations, including diverse baselines, viewpoints, and sensor placements
as well as varied environmental conditions such as lighting changes, weather
effects, and road geometries. We conduct comprehensive cross-domain experiments
across four standard evaluation datasets (KITTI2012, KITTI2015, Middlebury,
ETH3D) and demonstrate that models trained on StereoCarla outperform those
trained on 11 existing stereo datasets in terms of generalization accuracy
across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, when integrated into multi-dataset
training, StereoCarla contributes substantial improvements to generalization
accuracy, highlighting its compatibility and scalability. This dataset provides
a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating stereo algorithms under

Conclusion: SmokeBench数据集已公开发布，可用于下载，为解决火灾早期烟雾遮挡问题提供了重要的数据资源，有助于提升监控系统在火灾应急中的有效性。

Abstract: Early-stage fire scenes (0-15 minutes after ignition) represent a crucial
temporal window for emergency interventions. During this stage, the smoke
produced by combustion significantly reduces the visibility of surveillance
systems, severely impairing situational awareness and hindering effective
emergency response and rescue operations. Consequently, there is an urgent need
to remove smoke from images to obtain clear scene information. However, the
development of smoke removal algorithms remains limited due to the lack of
large-scale, real-world datasets comprising paired smoke-free and
smoke-degraded images. To address these limitations, we present a real-world
surveillance image desmoking benchmark dataset named SmokeBench, which contains
image pairs captured under diverse scenes setup and smoke concentration. The
curated dataset provides precisely aligned degraded and clean images, enabling
supervised learning and rigorous evaluation. We conduct comprehensive
experiments by benchmarking a variety of desmoking methods on our dataset. Our
dataset provides a valuable foundation for advancing robust and practical image
desmoking in real-world fire scenes. This dataset has been released to the

enabling natural language to guide the fusion process. However, existing
methods lack a goal-aligned task to supervise and evaluate how effectively the
input text contributes to the fusion outcome. We observe that referring image
segmentation (RIS) and text-driven fusion share a common objective:
highlighting the object referred to by the text. Motivated by this, we propose
RIS-FUSION, a cascaded framework that unifies fusion and RIS through joint
optimization. At its core is the LangGatedFusion module, which injects textual
features into the fusion backbone to enhance semantic alignment. To support
multimodal referring image segmentation task, we introduce MM-RIS, a
large-scale benchmark with 12.5k training and 3.5k testing triplets, each
consisting of an infrared-visible image pair, a segmentation mask, and a
referring expression. Extensive experiments show that RIS-FUSION achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by over 11% in
mIoU. Code and dataset will be released at

TL;DR: DeFA方法通过解构-重构框架进行特征增强和去偏策略，在组合零样本学习中实现了最先进的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决组合零样本学习中属性和对象纠缠问题以及现实数据中长尾分布问题，受神经科学发现启发（想象和感知共享相似神经过程）

Method: 提出Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA)方法，整合解构-重构框架进行特征增强，利用已见属性和对象的先验知识合成高保真组合特征

Result: 在三个广泛使用的数据集上，DeFA在封闭世界和开放世界设置中都达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: DeFA通过特征增强和去偏策略有效解决了组合零样本学习的挑战，验证了神经科学启发的有效性

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen
attribute-object compositions by learning prior knowledge of seen primitives,
\textit{i.e.}, attributes and objects. Learning generalizable compositional
representations in CZSL remains challenging due to the entangled nature of
attributes and objects as well as the prevalence of long-tailed distributions
in real-world data. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that imagination and
perception share similar neural processes, we propose a novel approach called
Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA) to address these challenges. The proposed
DeFA integrates a disentangle-and-reconstruct framework for feature
augmentation with a debiasing strategy. DeFA explicitly leverages the prior
knowledge of seen attributes and objects by synthesizing high-fidelity
composition features to support compositional generalization. Extensive
experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DeFA achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both \textit{closed-world} and
\textit{open-world} settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AsyMoE是一种新颖的混合专家架构，专门解决视觉-语言模型中视觉和语言处理的不对称性问题，通过三种专家组实现模态特定处理和跨模态交互，显著提升性能并减少参数使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的混合专家方法在处理视觉和语言模态时面临不对称性挑战：视觉信息具有空间完整性，而语言需要保持序列上下文。深层语言专家逐渐失去上下文基础，过度依赖参数知识而非提供的多模态信息。

Method: 提出AsyMoE架构，包含三种专家组：1）模态内专家处理模态特定特征；2）双曲跨模态专家进行分层跨模态交互；3）证据优先语言专家抑制参数偏见并保持上下文基础。

Result: 实验表明AsyMoE相比普通MoE和模态特定MoE分别提升26.58%和15.45%的准确率，同时比密集模型减少25.45%的激活参数。

Conclusion: AsyMoE通过建模视觉-语言处理的不对称性，有效解决了现有MoE方法的局限性，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了计算成本，为大视觉-语言模型的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
on multimodal tasks through scaled architectures and extensive training.
However, existing Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches face challenges due to
the asymmetry between visual and linguistic processing. Visual information is
spatially complete, while language requires maintaining sequential context. As
a result, MoE models struggle to balance modality-specific features and
cross-modal interactions. Through systematic analysis, we observe that language
experts in deeper layers progressively lose contextual grounding and rely more
on parametric knowledge rather than utilizing the provided visual and
linguistic information. To address this, we propose AsyMoE, a novel
architecture that models this asymmetry using three specialized expert groups.
We design intra-modality experts for modality-specific processing, hyperbolic
inter-modality experts for hierarchical cross-modal interactions, and
evidence-priority language experts to suppress parametric biases and maintain
contextual grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsyMoE achieves
26.58% and 15.45% accuracy improvements over vanilla MoE and modality-specific
MoE respectively, with 25.45% fewer activated parameters than dense models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空间推理基准主要关注静态或全局可观察环境，无法捕捉长时程推理和记忆利用在部分可观察性和动态变化下的挑战。

Method: 设计了两个动态空间基准测试，每个动作都会触发环境结构变化，需要持续更新认知和策略。提出了基于主观经验的记忆机制用于跨任务经验迁移和验证。

Result: 实验表明，该基准测试揭示了主流模型在动态空间推理和长期记忆方面的关键局限性。

Conclusion: 该工作为未来方法学进展提供了一个全面的评估平台，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Most existing spatial reasoning benchmarks focus on static or globally
observable environments, failing to capture the challenges of long-horizon
reasoning and memory utilization under partial observability and dynamic
changes. We introduce two dynamic spatial benchmarks, locally observable maze
navigation and match-2 elimination that systematically evaluate models'
abilities in spatial understanding and adaptive planning when local perception,
environment feedback, and global objectives are tightly coupled. Each action
triggers structural changes in the environment, requiring continuous update of
cognition and strategy. We further propose a subjective experience-based memory
mechanism for cross-task experience transfer and validation. Experiments show
that our benchmarks reveal key limitations of mainstream models in dynamic
spatial reasoning and long-term memory, providing a comprehensive platform for
future methodological advances. Our code and data are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPGen是一种新颖的单视图3D生成方法，通过球面投影表示将3D几何信息编码为紧凑的多层2D图像表示，解决了传统方法中的视图不一致性问题，并能表示复杂内部结构和拓扑


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单视图3D生成模型通常采用多视图扩散先验来重建物体表面，但容易产生视图间的不一致性，且无法忠实表示复杂的内部结构或非平凡拓扑

Method: 将几何信息投影到边界球面上，然后展开为紧凑的结构化多层2D球面投影(SP)表示，完全在图像域中操作，直接继承强大的2D扩散先验

Result: SPGen在几何质量和计算效率方面显著优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: 球面投影表示方法同时提供了三个关键优势：一致性(消除视图不一致性)、灵活性(表示嵌套内部结构)和效率(直接利用2D扩散先验和有限计算资源高效微调)

Abstract: Existing single-view 3D generative models typically adopt multiview diffusion
priors to reconstruct object surfaces, yet they remain prone to inter-view
inconsistencies and are unable to faithfully represent complex internal
structure or nontrivial topologies. In particular, we encode geometry
information by projecting it onto a bounding sphere and unwrapping it into a
compact and structural multi-layer 2D Spherical Projection (SP) representation.
Operating solely in the image domain, SPGen offers three key advantages
simultaneously: (1) Consistency. The injective SP mapping encodes surface
geometry with a single viewpoint which naturally eliminates view inconsistency
and ambiguity; (2) Flexibility. Multi-layer SP maps represent nested internal
structures and support direct lifting to watertight or open 3D surfaces; (3)
Efficiency. The image-domain formulation allows the direct inheritance of
powerful 2D diffusion priors and enables efficient finetuning with limited
computational resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPGen
significantly outperforms existing baselines in geometric quality and
computational efficiency.

TL;DR: Defense2Attack是一种新颖的越狱方法，通过将防御模式融入攻击流程来显著提升视觉语言模型的越狱效果和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型(VLMs)具有强大能力，但存在越狱攻击漏洞。现有越狱方法在效果和效率方面仍有提升空间，研究发现将弱防御融入攻击流程可以显著增强越狱性能。

Method: 包含三个核心组件：1)视觉优化器，嵌入具有肯定和鼓励语义的通用对抗扰动；2)文本优化器，使用防御风格提示精炼输入；3)红队后缀生成器，通过强化学习微调增强越狱效果。

Result: 在4个VLMs和4个安全基准测试上的实验表明，Defense2Attack在单次尝试中实现了优越的越狱性能，超越了需要多次尝试的最先进攻击方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为VLMs越狱提供了新视角，展示了利用防御模式指导越狱提示设计的有效性。

Abstract: Despite their superb capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
shown to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. While recent jailbreaks have
achieved notable progress, their effectiveness and efficiency can still be
improved. In this work, we reveal an interesting phenomenon: incorporating weak
defense into the attack pipeline can significantly enhance both the
effectiveness and the efficiency of jailbreaks on VLMs. Building on this
insight, we propose Defense2Attack, a novel jailbreak method that bypasses the
safety guardrails of VLMs by leveraging defensive patterns to guide jailbreak
prompt design. Specifically, Defense2Attack consists of three key components:
(1) a visual optimizer that embeds universal adversarial perturbations with
affirmative and encouraging semantics; (2) a textual optimizer that refines the
input using a defense-styled prompt; and (3) a red-team suffix generator that
enhances the jailbreak through reinforcement fine-tuning. We empirically
evaluate our method on four VLMs and four safety benchmarks. The results
demonstrate that Defense2Attack achieves superior jailbreak performance in a
single attempt, outperforming state-of-the-art attack methods that often
require multiple tries. Our work offers a new perspective on jailbreaking VLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的Gaussian管理方法，通过动态激活球谐函数或法向量来缓解梯度冲突，并开发轻量级表示来平衡重建质量和参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Gaussian Splatting方法采用无差别的属性分配策略，导致梯度冲突和重建质量不佳，需要更有效的Gaussian管理策略。

Method: 引入新颖的致密化策略，在表面重建模块监督下动态激活SH或法向量；开发轻量级Gaussian表示，基于梯度幅度自适应调整SH阶数，并进行任务解耦剪枝。

Result: 在重建质量和效率方面均优于最先进方法，使用显著更少的参数实现优越性能。

Conclusion: 该方法具有模型无关性，可无缝集成到其他框架中，在提升性能的同时减小模型规模。

Abstract: This paper proposes an effective Gaussian management approach for
high-fidelity object reconstruction. Departing from recent Gaussian Splatting
(GS) methods that employ indiscriminate attribute assignment, our approach
introduces a novel densification strategy that dynamically activates spherical
harmonics (SHs) or normals under the supervision of a surface reconstruction
module, which effectively mitigates the gradient conflicts caused by dual
supervision and achieves superior reconstruction results. To further improve
representation efficiency, we develop a lightweight Gaussian representation
that adaptively adjusts the SH orders of each Gaussian based on gradient
magnitudes and performs task-decoupled pruning to remove Gaussian with minimal
impact on a reconstruction task without sacrificing others, which balances the
representational capacity with parameter quantity. Notably, our management
approach is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into other
frameworks, enhancing performance while reducing model size. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and efficiency,
achieving superior performance with significantly fewer parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文分析了ConvNeXt架构深度可分离网络中学习到的8个"主键滤波器"，通过空间扩散测量和可分离滤波操作建模，证明了学习到的滤波器可以用离散尺度空间滤波器很好地近似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度可分离卷积网络中学习到的滤波器的数学特性，验证这些滤波器是否可以通过理论模型来准确描述和替代。

Method: 首先计算学习滤波器的加权均值和加权方差作为空间扩散度量，然后使用高斯核的离散模拟进行空间平滑操作的差分算子来建模主键滤波器，采用两种不同的尺度参数设置和两种拟合方法（空间方差相等或最小化l1/l2范数）。

Result: 理想化的感受野模型与学习到的滤波器在定性上表现出良好的相似性，实验证明用理想化滤波器替换学习到的滤波器在深度可分离网络中具有良好的预测性能。

Conclusion: 深度可分离深度网络中学习到的滤波器可以通过离散尺度空间滤波器很好地近似，这为理解和简化深度网络架构提供了理论依据。

Abstract: This paper presents the results of analysing and modelling a set of 8
``master key filters'', which have been extracted by applying a clustering
approach to the receptive fields learned in depthwise-separable deep networks
based on the ConvNeXt architecture.
  For this purpose, we first compute spatial spread measures in terms of
weighted mean values and weighted variances of the absolute values of the
learned filters, which support the working hypotheses that: (i) the learned
filters can be modelled by separable filtering operations over the spatial
domain, and that (ii) the spatial offsets of the those learned filters that are
non-centered are rather close to half a grid unit. Then, we model the clustered
``master key filters'' in terms of difference operators applied to a spatial
smoothing operation in terms of the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel,
and demonstrate that the resulting idealized models of the receptive fields
show good qualitative similarity to the learned filters.
  This modelling is performed in two different ways: (i) using possibly
different values of the scale parameters in the coordinate directions for each
filter, and (ii) using the same value of the scale parameter in both coordinate
directions. Then, we perform the actual model fitting by either (i) requiring
spatial spread measures in terms of spatial variances of the absolute values of
the receptive fields to be equal, or (ii) minimizing the discrete $l_1$- or
$l_2$-norms between the idealized receptive field models and the learned
filters.
  Complementary experimental results then demonstrate the idealized models of
receptive fields have good predictive properties for replacing the learned
filters by idealized filters in depthwise-separable deep networks, thus showing
that the learned filters in depthwise-separable deep networks can be well
approximated by discrete scale-space filters.

TL;DR: 本文研究多模态LLM与人类在图像质量评估方面的差异，发现LLM在理解图像美学、解剖准确性等属性方面与人类存在显著不同


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化评估文本到图像生成模型是一个挑战，现有研究使用多模态LLM评估图像质量，但缺乏对LLM如何利用人类相关概念（如图像风格、构图等）进行判断的深入理解

Method: 首先使用合成生成的图像对构建人类偏好数据集，通过分析图像质量属性间的跨任务相关性来理解人类判断机制，然后对LLM进行相同分析，并针对单个图像质量属性生成高控制度的合成数据集进行研究

Result: 发现图像质量属性间的关系在人类判断中较强，但在LLM中较弱；人类能轻松判断所有特定图像质量属性，但LLM在某些属性（如解剖准确性）上学习判断较为困难

Conclusion: 研究揭示了人类和多模态LLM在图像感知方面存在有趣差异，为改进自动化图像质量评估提供了重要见解

Abstract: Automated evaluation of generative text-to-image models remains a challenging
problem. Recent works have proposed using multimodal LLMs to judge the quality
of images, but these works offer little insight into how multimodal LLMs make
use of concepts relevant to humans, such as image style or composition, to
generate their overall assessment. In this work, we study what attributes of an
image--specifically aesthetics, lack of artifacts, anatomical accuracy,
compositional correctness, object adherence, and style--are important for both
LLMs and humans to make judgments on image quality. We first curate a dataset
of human preferences using synthetically generated image pairs. We use
inter-task correlation between each pair of image quality attributes to
understand which attributes are related in making human judgments. Repeating
the same analysis with LLMs, we find that the relationships between image
quality attributes are much weaker. Finally, we study individual image quality
attributes by generating synthetic datasets with a high degree of control for
each axis. Humans are able to easily judge the quality of an image with respect
to all of the specific image quality attributes (e.g. high vs. low aesthetic
image), however we find that some attributes, such as anatomical accuracy, are
much more difficult for multimodal LLMs to learn to judge. Taken together,
these findings reveal interesting differences between how humans and multimodal
LLMs perceive images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将跨视角物体地理定位视为一次性检测任务，直接回归位置，容易受到特征噪声影响且缺乏错误校正机制。

Method: 提出循环定位框架，使用可学习token编码查询意图并迭代优化位置；引入SAM知识蒸馏策略提供语义指导；设计参考特征增强模块(RFEM)通过分层注意力强调物体相关区域。

Result: 在标准CVOGL基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时相比之前SOTA方法减少60%参数。

Conclusion: ReCOT通过循环定位框架和知识蒸馏策略有效解决了CVOGL任务中的噪声和错误校正问题，实现了高效准确的物体地理定位。

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization (CVOGL) aims to determine the location of
a specific object in high-resolution satellite imagery given a query image with
a point prompt. Existing approaches treat CVOGL as a one-shot detection task,
directly regressing object locations from cross-view information aggregation,
but they are vulnerable to feature noise and lack mechanisms for error
correction. In this paper, we propose ReCOT, a Recurrent Cross-view Object
geo-localization Transformer, which reformulates CVOGL as a recurrent
localization task. ReCOT introduces a set of learnable tokens that encode
task-specific intent from the query image and prompt embeddings, and
iteratively attend to the reference features to refine the predicted location.
To enhance this recurrent process, we incorporate two complementary modules:
(1) a SAM-based knowledge distillation strategy that transfers segmentation
priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to provide clearer semantic
guidance without additional inference cost, and (2) a Reference Feature
Enhancement Module (RFEM) that introduces a hierarchical attention to emphasize
object-relevant regions in the reference features. Extensive experiments on
standard CVOGL benchmarks demonstrate that ReCOT achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance while reducing parameters by 60% compared to previous SOTA
approaches.

Motivation: 传统TDOM生成方法依赖复杂的离线摄影测量流程，存在延迟问题且质量可能因相机姿态不准确、DSM误差和场景遮挡而下降，无法满足实时应用需求

Method: 基于实时3DGS优化，通过在线SfM计算每张图像的姿态和稀疏点云，将新高斯点集成并优化到先前未见或粗略重建区域，结合正交溅射技术实现实时渲染

Result: 在多个基准测试中，A-TDOM能够以近实时方式主动渲染TDOM，每张新图像的3DGS优化仅需数秒，同时保持可接受的渲染质量和几何精度

Conclusion: A-TDOM方法成功解决了传统TDOM生成方法的延迟问题，实现了近实时的正射影像图生成，为城市管理、城市规划等领域的实时应用提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: True Digital Orthophoto Map (TDOM) serves as a crucial geospatial product in
various fields such as urban management, city planning, land surveying, etc.
However, traditional TDOM generation methods generally rely on a complex
offline photogrammetric pipeline, resulting in delays that hinder real-time
applications. Moreover, the quality of TDOM may degrade due to various
challenges, such as inaccurate camera poses or Digital Surface Model (DSM) and
scene occlusions. To address these challenges, this work introduces A-TDOM, a
near real-time TDOM generation method based on On-the-Fly 3DGS optimization. As
each image is acquired, its pose and sparse point cloud are computed via
On-the-Fly SfM. Then new Gaussians are integrated and optimized into previously
unseen or coarsely reconstructed regions. By integrating with orthogonal
splatting, A-TDOM can render just after each update of a new 3DGS field.
Initial experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed A-TDOM is
capable of actively rendering TDOM in near real-time, with 3DGS optimization
for each new image in seconds while maintaining acceptable rendering quality
and TDOM geometric accuracy.

intensive processing demands. This paper proposes the DyGLNet, which achieves
efficient and accurate segmentation by fusing global and local features with a
dynamic upsampling mechanism. The model innovatively designs a hybrid feature
extraction module (SHDCBlock), combining single-head self-attention and
multi-scale dilated convolutions to model local details and global context
collaboratively. We further introduce a dynamic adaptive upsampling module
(DyFusionUp) to realize high-fidelity reconstruction of feature maps based on
learnable offsets. Then, a lightweight design is adopted to reduce
computational overhead. Experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that
DyGLNet outperforms existing methods, particularly excelling in boundary
accuracy and small-object segmentation. Meanwhile, it exhibits lower
computation complexity, enabling an efficient and reliable solution for
clinical medical image analysis. The code will be made available soon.

TL;DR: BATR-FST是一个用于少样本学习的双层次自适应令牌精化方法，通过令牌聚类、不确定性感知权重和双层次注意力机制，在预训练和元微调阶段提升Vision Transformers的少样本分类性能。


<details>

Motivation: Vision Transformers在少样本学习中面临令牌级交互精化不足、训练数据有限和归纳偏置不强的问题。现有方法依赖不灵活的令牌匹配或简单相似性度量，限制了全局上下文和局部特征精化的有效整合。

Method: 提出BATR-FST两阶段方法：1）预训练阶段使用掩码图像建模获得可迁移的补丁级表示；2）元微调阶段包含双层次自适应令牌精化模块（令牌聚类、不确定性感知令牌加权、双层次注意力机制）、图令牌传播确保支持-查询实例语义一致性，以及类分离惩罚保持类别边界。

Result: 在三个基准少样本数据集上的广泛实验表明，BATR-FST在1-shot和5-shot场景中均取得了优异结果，提升了基于transformer的少样本分类性能。

Conclusion: BATR-FST通过渐进式令牌表示改进和保持强归纳偏置，有效解决了Vision Transformers在少样本学习中的挑战，为少样本分类提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown significant promise in computer vision
applications. However, their performance in few-shot learning is limited by
challenges in refining token-level interactions, struggling with limited
training data, and developing a strong inductive bias. Existing methods often
depend on inflexible token matching or basic similarity measures, which limit
the effective incorporation of global context and localized feature refinement.
To address these challenges, we propose Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for
Few-Shot Transformers (BATR-FST), a two-stage approach that progressively
improves token representations and maintains a robust inductive bias for
few-shot classification. During the pre-training phase, Masked Image Modeling
(MIM) provides Vision Transformers (ViTs) with transferable patch-level
representations by recreating masked image regions, providing a robust basis
for subsequent adaptation. In the meta-fine-tuning phase, BATR-FST incorporates
a Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement module that utilizes Token Clustering to
capture localized interactions, Uncertainty-Aware Token Weighting to prioritize
dependable features, and a Bi-Level Attention mechanism to balance
intra-cluster and inter-cluster relationships, thereby facilitating thorough
token refinement. Furthermore, Graph Token Propagation ensures semantic
consistency between support and query instances, while a Class Separation
Penalty preserves different class borders, enhancing discriminative capability.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark few-shot datasets demonstrate that
BATR-FST achieves superior results in both 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios and
improves the few-shot classification via transformers.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is the primary imaging technique
that provides valuable spatial-temporal information about lesions, enabling the
accurate diagnosis and subclassification of pancreatic tumors. However, the
high heterogeneity and variability of pancreatic tumors still pose substantial
challenges for precise subtyping diagnosis. Previous methods fail to
effectively explore the contextual information across multiple CECT phases
commonly used in radiologists' diagnostic workflows, thereby limiting their
performance. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, an automatic way
to combine the multi-phase CECT data to discriminate between pancreatic tumor
subtypes, among which the key is using Mamba with promising learnability and
simplicity to encourage both temporal and spatial modeling from multi-phase
CECT. Specifically, we propose a dual hierarchical contrast-enhanced-aware
Mamba module incorporating two novel spatial and temporal sampling sequences to
explore intra and inter-phase contrast variations of lesions. A
similarity-guided refinement module is also imposed into the temporal scanning
modeling to emphasize the learning on local tumor regions with more obvious
temporal variations. Moreover, we design the space complementary integrator and
multi-granularity fusion module to encode and aggregate the semantics across
different scales, achieving more efficient learning for subtyping pancreatic
tumors. The experimental results on an in-house dataset of 270 clinical cases
achieve an accuracy of 97.4% and an AUC of 98.6% in distinguishing between
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
(PNETs), demonstrating its potential as a more accurate and efficient tool.

TL;DR: 提出了一种上下文表示学习网络，通过整合功能推理和上下文提示来改进人-物交互检测，在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有两阶段方法在上下文建模方面存在不足，无法充分捕捉复杂的交互关系，特别是涉及辅助工具的多变量关系

Method: 扩展传统HOI检测框架，引入三元组结构<人、工具、物体>显式建模辅助对象的功能角色，使用可学习提示与视觉特征通过注意力机制融合

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集的大多数场景中表现出优越性能

Conclusion: 通过上下文化表示学习和功能推理，能够更可靠地处理复杂、依赖上下文的交互关系

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to simultaneously localize
human-object pairs and recognize their interactions. While recent two-stage
approaches have made significant progress, they still face challenges due to
incomplete context modeling. In this work, we introduce a Contextualized
Representation Learning Network that integrates both affordance-guided
reasoning and contextual prompts with visual cues to better capture complex
interactions. We enhance the conventional HOI detection framework by expanding
it beyond simple human-object pairs to include multivariate relationships
involving auxiliary entities like tools. Specifically, we explicitly model the
functional role (affordance) of these auxiliary objects through triplet
structures <human, tool, object>. This enables our model to identify
tool-dependent interactions such as 'filling'. Furthermore, the learnable
prompt is enriched with instance categories and subsequently integrated with
contextual visual features using an attention mechanism. This process aligns
language with image content at both global and regional levels. These
contextualized representations equip the model with enriched relational cues
for more reliable reasoning over complex, context-dependent interactions. Our
proposed method demonstrates superior performance on both the HICO-Det and
V-COCO datasets in most scenarios. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: DH-Diff框架有效解决了合成异常数据生成中的关键挑战，为制造业视觉异常检测提供了高质量的合成训练数据。

Abstract: Visual anomaly inspection is critical in manufacturing, yet hampered by the
scarcity of real anomaly samples for training robust detectors. Synthetic data
generation presents a viable strategy for data augmentation; however, current
methods remain constrained by two principal limitations: 1) the generation of
anomalies that are structurally inconsistent with the normal background, and 2)
the presence of undesirable feature entanglement between synthesized images and
their corresponding annotation masks, which undermines the perceptual realism
of the output. This paper introduces Double Helix Diffusion (DH-Diff), a novel
cross-domain generative framework designed to simultaneously synthesize
high-fidelity anomaly images and their pixel-level annotation masks, explicitly
addressing these challenges. DH-Diff employs a unique architecture inspired by
a double helix, cycling through distinct modules for feature separation,
connection, and merging. Specifically, a domain-decoupled attention mechanism
mitigates feature entanglement by enhancing image and annotation features
independently, and meanwhile a semantic score map alignment module ensures
structural authenticity by coherently integrating anomaly foregrounds. DH-Diff
offers flexible control via text prompts and optional graphical guidance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DH-Diff significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in diversity and authenticity, leading to significant
improvements in downstream anomaly detection performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超像素方法依赖低级特征，深度学习方法虽然利用高级特征但牺牲了超像素的规则性，导致分割结果准确但可解释性差

Method: 训练模型提取图像特征用于超像素生成，推理时利用大规模预训练模型进行语义无关分割，确保超像素与对象掩码对齐，可处理任何先验高级分割并解决不确定区域

Result: 综合实验表明SPAM在分割任务上定性和定量都优于最先进方法

Conclusion: SPAM是一个有价值且鲁棒的工具，适用于各种应用场景

Abstract: Superpixels are widely used in computer vision to simplify image
representation and reduce computational complexity. While traditional methods
rely on low-level features, deep learning-based approaches leverage high-level
features but also tend to sacrifice regularity of superpixels to capture
complex objects, leading to accurate but less interpretable segmentations. In
this work, we introduce SPAM (SuperPixel Anything Model), a versatile framework
for segmenting images into accurate yet regular superpixels. We train a model
to extract image features for superpixel generation, and at inference, we
leverage a large-scale pretrained model for semantic-agnostic segmentation to
ensure that superpixels align with object masks. SPAM can handle any prior
high-level segmentation, resolving uncertainty regions, and is able to
interactively focus on specific objects. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that SPAM qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art methods
on segmentation tasks, making it a valuable and robust tool for various
applications. Code and pre-trained models are available here:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性注意力对历史键值信息进行均匀压缩，导致特征冗余和查询对齐丢失，造成性能差距

Method: 引入输入自适应的可学习门控选择性调制KV特征图的信息聚合，增强语义多样性并缓解低秩约束；提出高效的Hadamard乘积分解方法计算门控

Result: 在1280×1280分辨率下，相比PVT-T实现1.76倍吞吐量提升和2.69倍峰值GPU内存减少；在ImageNet上top-1准确率提升达4.4%

Conclusion: SAGA在线性注意力框架内有效解决了特征冗余和低秩约束问题，实现了计算效率和模型性能的双重提升

Abstract: While Transformer architecture excel at modeling long-range dependencies
contributing to its widespread adoption in vision tasks the quadratic
complexity of softmax-based attention mechanisms imposes a major bottleneck,
particularly when processing high-resolution images. Linear attention presents
a promising alternative by reformulating the attention computation from $(QK)V$
to $Q(KV)$, thereby reducing the complexity from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(N)$ while preserving the global receptive field. However, most
existing methods compress historical key-value (KV) information uniformly,
which can lead to feature redundancy and the loss of directional alignment with
the query (Q). This uniform compression results in low-rank $KV$ feature maps,
contributing to a performance gap compared to softmax attention. To mitigate
this limitation, we propose \textbf{S}elective \textbf{A}daptive
\textbf{GA}ting for Efficient and Expressive Linear Attention (SAGA) , which
introduces input-adaptive learnable gates to selectively modulate information
aggregation into the $KV$ feature map. These gates enhance semantic diversity
and alleviate the low-rank constraint inherent in conventional linear
attention. Additionally, we propose an efficient Hadamard-product decomposition
method for gate computation, which introduces no additional memory overhead.
Experiments demonstrate that SAGA achieves a 1.76$\times$ improvement in
throughput and a 2.69$\times$ reduction in peak GPU memory compared to PVT-T at
a resolution of $1280 \times 1280$. Moreover, it improves top-1 accuracy by up
to 4.4\% on the ImageNet dataset, demonstrating both computational efficiency
and model effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像基础模型受限于较小的数据集规模，需要系统研究数据规模和预训练范式在医学影像设置中对性能的影响。

Method: 使用来自单一机构的350万张胸部X光片，对代表CLIP和DINOv2两种主要编码器范式的MI2和RAD-DINO进行持续预训练，保持计算和评估协议不变，评估分类、分割和放射报告生成任务。

Result: MI2在发现相关任务中扩展更有效，RAD-DINO在导管相关任务中表现更强；使用UniCL同时使用报告和结构化标签持续预训练MI2可提升性能；某些任务仅需3万张领域内样本即可超越开放权重基础模型。

Conclusion: 中心特定的持续预训练具有重要实用价值，医疗机构通过利用领域内数据可以获得显著的性能增益，不同编码器范式在不同类型的医学影像任务中各具优势。

Abstract: Foundation vision encoders such as CLIP and DINOv2, trained on web-scale
data, exhibit strong transfer performance across tasks and datasets. However,
medical imaging foundation models remain constrained by smaller datasets,
limiting our understanding of how data scale and pretraining paradigms affect
performance in this setting. In this work, we systematically study continual
pretraining of two vision encoders, MedImageInsight (MI2) and RAD-DINO
representing the two major encoder paradigms CLIP and DINOv2, on up to 3.5M
chest x-rays from a single institution, holding compute and evaluation
protocols constant. We evaluate on classification (radiology findings, lines
and tubes), segmentation (lines and tubes), and radiology report generation.
While prior work has primarily focused on tasks related to radiology findings,
we include lines and tubes tasks to counterbalance this bias and evaluate a
model's ability to extract features that preserve continuity along elongated
structures. Our experiments show that MI2 scales more effectively for
finding-related tasks, while RAD-DINO is stronger on tube-related tasks.
Surprisingly, continually pretraining MI2 with both reports and structured
labels using UniCL improves performance, underscoring the value of structured
supervision at scale. We further show that for some tasks, as few as 30k
in-domain samples are sufficient to surpass open-weights foundation models.
These results highlight the utility of center-specific continual pretraining,
enabling medical institutions to derive significant performance gains by
utilizing in-domain data.

Motivation: NeRF生成图像存在独特伪影，现有单一度量方法在不同数据集上表现不一致，需要融合不同感知方法的度量来克服个体局限性

Method: 采用两种归一化策略处理个体度量，两种融合策略组合DISTS和VMAF指标，在合成和室外两个数据集上测试三种配置

Conclusion: 基于不同感知方法的度量融合能够有效提升NeRF生成图像质量评估的准确性，为质量评估提供了更可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated significant potential in
synthesizing novel viewpoints. Evaluating the NeRF-generated outputs, however,
remains a challenge due to the unique artifacts they exhibit, and no individual
metric performs well across all datasets. We hypothesize that combining two
successful metrics, Deep Image Structure and Texture Similarity (DISTS) and
Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion (VMAF), based on different perceptual
methods, can overcome the limitations of individual metrics and achieve
improved correlation with subjective quality scores. We experiment with two
normalization strategies for the individual metrics and two fusion strategies
to evaluate their impact on the resulting correlation with the subjective
scores. The proposed pipeline is tested on two distinct datasets, Synthetic and
Outdoor, and its performance is evaluated across three different
configurations. We present a detailed analysis comparing the correlation
coefficients of fusion methods and individual scores with subjective scores to
demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the fusion metrics.

Abstract: It is well-established that more data generally improves AI model
performance. However, data collection can be challenging for certain tasks due
to the rarity of occurrences or high costs. These challenges are evident in our
use case, where we apply AI models to a novel approach for visually documenting
the musculoskeletal condition of dogs. Here, abnormalities are marked as
colored strokes on a body map of a dog. Since these strokes correspond to
distinct muscles or joints, they can be mapped to the textual domain in which
large language models (LLMs) operate. LLMs have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across a wide range of tasks, including medical applications,
offering promising potential for generating synthetic training data. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs can effectively generate synthetic visual
training data for canine musculoskeletal diagnoses. For this, we developed a
mapping that segments visual documentations into over 200 labeled regions
representing muscles or joints. Using techniques like guided decoding,
chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot prompting, we generated 1,000
synthetic visual documentations for patellar luxation (kneecap dislocation)
diagnosis, the diagnosis for which we have the most real-world data. Our
analysis shows that the generated documentations are sensitive to location and
severity of the diagnosis while remaining independent of the dog's sex. We
further generated 1,000 visual documentations for various other diagnoses to
create a binary classification dataset. A model trained solely on this
synthetic data achieved an F1 score of 88% on 70 real-world documentations.
These results demonstrate the potential of LLM-generated synthetic data, which
is particularly valuable for addressing data scarcity in rare diseases. While
our methodology is tailored to the medical domain, the insights and techniques
can be adapted to other fields.

Conclusion: CCS为物体检测器提供了无需标注的DevOps风格监控方案，能够有效识别性能不足的场景

Abstract: Evaluating object detection models in deployment is challenging because
ground-truth annotations are rarely available. We introduce the Cumulative
Consensus Score (CCS), a label-free metric that enables continuous monitoring
and comparison of detectors in real-world settings. CCS applies test-time data
augmentation to each image, collects predicted bounding boxes across augmented
views, and computes overlaps using Intersection over Union. Maximum overlaps
are normalized and averaged across augmentation pairs, yielding a measure of
spatial consistency that serves as a proxy for reliability without annotations.
In controlled experiments on Open Images and KITTI, CCS achieved over 90%
congruence with F1-score, Probabilistic Detection Quality, and Optimal
Correction Cost. The method is model-agnostic, working across single-stage and
two-stage detectors, and operates at the case level to highlight
under-performing scenarios. Altogether, CCS provides a robust foundation for
DevOps-style monitoring of object detectors.

Abstract: Few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation aims to segment novel
categories using a minimal number of annotated support samples. While existing
prototype-based methods have shown promise, they are constrained by two
critical challenges: (1) Intra-class Diversity, where a prototype's limited
representational capacity fails to cover a class's full variations, and (2)
Inter-set Inconsistency, where prototypes derived from the support set are
misaligned with the query feature space. Motivated by the powerful generative
capability of diffusion model, we re-purpose its pre-trained conditional
encoder to provide a novel source of generalizable features for expanding the
prototype's representational range. Under this setup, we introduce the
Prototype Expansion Network (PENet), a framework that constructs big-capacity
prototypes from two complementary feature sources. PENet employs a dual-stream
learner architecture: it retains a conventional fully supervised Intrinsic
Learner (IL) to distill representative features, while introducing a novel
Diffusion Learner (DL) to provide rich generalizable features. The resulting
dual prototypes are then processed by a Prototype Assimilation Module (PAM),
which adopts a novel push-pull cross-guidance attention block to iteratively
align the prototypes with the query space. Furthermore, a Prototype Calibration
Mechanism (PCM) regularizes the final big capacity prototype to prevent
semantic drift. Extensive experiments on the S3DIS and ScanNet datasets
demonstrate that PENet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various few-shot settings.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has garnered significant attention due to its
direct interaction with users. However, real-world user instructions are
immensely diverse, and existing methods often fail to generalize effectively to
instructions outside their training domain, limiting their practical
application. To address this, we propose Lego-Edit, which leverages the
generalization capability of Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to
organize a suite of model-level editing tools to tackle this challenge.
Lego-Edit incorporates two key designs: (1) a model-level toolkit comprising
diverse models efficiently trained on limited data and several image
manipulation functions, enabling fine-grained composition of editing actions by
the MLLM; and (2) a three-stage progressive reinforcement learning approach
that uses feedback on unannotated, open-domain instructions to train the MLLM,
equipping it with generalized reasoning capabilities for handling real-world
instructions. Experiments demonstrate that Lego-Edit achieves state-of-the-art
performance on GEdit-Bench and ImgBench. It exhibits robust reasoning
capabilities for open-domain instructions and can utilize newly introduced
editing tools without additional fine-tuning.

Abstract: Rectified flow (RF) models have recently demonstrated superior generative
performance compared to DDIM-based diffusion models. However, in real-world
applications, they suffer from two major challenges: (1) low inversion accuracy
that hinders the consistency with the source image, and (2) entangled
multimodal attention in diffusion transformers, which hinders precise attention
control. To address the first challenge, we propose an efficient high-order
inversion method for rectified flow models based on the Runge-Kutta solver of
differential equations. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce Decoupled
Diffusion Transformer Attention (DDTA), a novel mechanism that disentangles
text and image attention inside the multimodal diffusion transformers, enabling
more precise semantic control. Extensive experiments on image reconstruction
and text-guided editing tasks demonstrate that our method achieves

Conclusion: 所提出的MEJO框架通过联合优化策略成功解决了手术三元组识别中的任务间和任务内优化冲突，为复杂手术场景理解提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Surgical triplet recognition, which involves identifying instrument, verb,
target, and their combinations, is a complex surgical scene understanding
challenge plagued by long-tailed data distribution. The mainstream multi-task
learning paradigm benefiting from cross-task collaborative promotion has shown
promising performance in identifying triples, but two key challenges remain: 1)
inter-task optimization conflicts caused by entangling task-generic and
task-specific representations; 2) intra-task optimization conflicts due to
class-imbalanced training data. To overcome these difficulties, we propose the
MLLM-Engaged Joint Optimization (MEJO) framework that empowers both inter- and
intra-task optimization for surgical triplet recognition. For inter-task
optimization, we introduce the Shared-Specific-Disentangled (S$^2$D) learning
scheme that decomposes representations into task-shared and task-specific
components. To enhance task-shared representations, we construct a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM) powered probabilistic prompt pool to dynamically
augment visual features with expert-level semantic cues. Additionally,
comprehensive task-specific cues are modeled via distinct task prompts covering
the temporal-spatial dimensions, effectively mitigating inter-task ambiguities.
To tackle intra-task optimization conflicts, we develop a Coordinated Gradient
Learning (CGL) strategy, which dissects and rebalances the positive-negative
gradients originating from head and tail classes for more coordinated learning
behaviors. Extensive experiments on the CholecT45 and CholecT50 datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework, validating its
effectiveness in handling optimization conflicts.

Abstract: We introduce DialNav, a novel collaborative embodied dialog task, where a
navigation agent (Navigator) and a remote guide (Guide) engage in multi-turn
dialog to reach a goal location. Unlike prior work, DialNav aims for holistic
evaluation and requires the Guide to infer the Navigator's location, making
communication essential for task success. To support this task, we collect and
release the Remote Assistance in Navigation (RAIN) dataset, human-human dialog
paired with navigation trajectories in photorealistic environments. We design a
comprehensive benchmark to evaluate both navigation and dialog, and conduct
extensive experiments analyzing the impact of different Navigator and Guide
models. We highlight key challenges and publicly release the dataset, code, and
evaluation framework to foster future research in embodied dialog.

*Jianfei Zhao,Feng Zhang,Xin Sun,Lingxing Kong,Zhixing Tan,Chong Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了跨层视觉平滑（CLVS）方法，通过引入视觉记忆机制来维持大视觉语言模型对关键物体的持续关注，从而提升视觉理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大视觉语言模型能够准确定位图像中的关键物体，但对这些物体的注意力往往很短暂。假设持续关注关键物体可以改善模型的视觉能力。

Method: CLVS方法包含视觉记忆机制，在第一层使用位置无偏的视觉注意力初始化记忆，后续层中联合考虑先前层的视觉记忆，并通过迭代更新保持对关键物体的平滑注意力。使用不确定性作为视觉理解完成的指标来终止平滑过程。

Result: 在四个基准测试和三个大视觉语言模型上的实验证实了方法的有效性和泛化性。CLVS在各种视觉理解任务上达到了最先进的性能，特别是在关系和属性理解方面有显著改进。

Conclusion: 跨层视觉平滑方法通过维持对关键物体的持续关注，有效提升了大视觉语言模型的视觉理解能力，特别是在复杂视觉推理任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can accurately locate key objects in
images, yet their attention to these objects tends to be very brief. Motivated
by the hypothesis that sustained focus on key objects can improve LVLMs' visual
capabilities, we propose Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS). The core idea of
CLVS is to incorporate a vision memory that smooths the attention distribution
across layers. Specifically, we initialize this vision memory with
position-unbiased visual attention in the first layer. In subsequent layers,
the model's visual attention jointly considers the vision memory from previous
layers, while the memory is updated iteratively, thereby maintaining smooth
attention on key objects. Given that visual understanding primarily occurs in
the early and middle layers of the model, we use uncertainty as an indicator of
completed visual understanding and terminate the smoothing process accordingly.
Experiments on four benchmarks across three LVLMs confirm the effectiveness and
generalizability of our method. CLVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on a
variety of visual understanding tasks, with particularly significant
improvements in relation and attribute understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSGFusion是一个基于多模态场景图指导的红外与可见光图像融合框架，通过结构化场景图显式建模实体、属性和空间关系，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法主要依赖纹理、对比度等低层视觉线索，难以捕捉图像中的高层语义信息。最近尝试使用文本作为语义指导的方法依赖于非结构化描述，无法显式建模实体、属性和关系，也缺乏空间定位能力，限制了细粒度融合性能。

Method: 提出MSGFusion框架，通过深度耦合来自文本和视觉的结构化场景图，显式表示实体、属性和空间关系，然后通过场景图表示、层次聚合和图驱动融合等连续模块同步优化高层语义和低层细节。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试上的广泛实验表明，MSGFusion显著优于最先进的方法，特别是在细节保持和结构清晰度方面，并在下游任务（如低光目标检测、语义分割和医学图像融合）中展现出优异的语义一致性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: MSGFusion通过结构化场景图指导的红外与可见光图像融合框架，成功解决了现有方法在高层语义捕捉和细粒度融合方面的局限性，为多模态图像融合提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion has garnered considerable attention owing
to the strong complementarity of these two modalities in complex, harsh
environments. While deep learning-based fusion methods have made remarkable
advances in feature extraction, alignment, fusion, and reconstruction, they
still depend largely on low-level visual cues, such as texture and contrast,
and struggle to capture the high-level semantic information embedded in images.
Recent attempts to incorporate text as a source of semantic guidance have
relied on unstructured descriptions that neither explicitly model entities,
attributes, and relationships nor provide spatial localization, thereby
limiting fine-grained fusion performance. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce MSGFusion, a multimodal scene graph-guided fusion framework for
infrared and visible imagery. By deeply coupling structured scene graphs
derived from text and vision, MSGFusion explicitly represents entities,
attributes, and spatial relations, and then synchronously refines high-level
semantics and low-level details through successive modules for scene graph
representation, hierarchical aggregation, and graph-driven fusion. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that MSGFusion significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in detail preservation
and structural clarity, and delivers superior semantic consistency and
generalizability in downstream tasks such as low-light object detection,
semantic segmentation, and medical image fusion.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的生成式异常检测方法，通过图像到图像转换和补丁相似性评分，在医学影像中实现精确的异常定位和分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中正常组织的精细变异性（如肺部解剖结构）对现有生成式异常检测方法构成挑战，需要开发能够处理这种变异性的新方法。

Method: 该方法包括两个步骤：1）使用图像到图像转换进行无异常重建；2）通过观察图像与生成图像对的补丁相似性评分来实现精确的异常定位。

Result: 在胸部CT扫描中检测感染性病变和T1加权脑MRI中缺血性卒中病变分割任务上均表现出色，相比其他最先进的重建方法，DICE分数分别相对提高了+1.9%和+4.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理医学影像中的正常组织变异性，在多个医学影像模态上实现了改进的像素级异常分割性能，具有很好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Early detection of newly emerging diseases, lesion severity assessment,
differentiation of medical conditions and automated screening are examples for
the wide applicability and importance of anomaly detection (AD) and
unsupervised segmentation in medicine. Normal fine-grained tissue variability
such as present in pulmonary anatomy is a major challenge for existing
generative AD methods. Here, we propose a novel generative AD approach
addressing this issue. It consists of an image-to-image translation for
anomaly-free reconstruction and a subsequent patch similarity scoring between
observed and generated image-pairs for precise anomaly localization. We
validate the new method on chest computed tomography (CT) scans for the
detection and segmentation of infectious disease lesions. To assess
generalizability, we evaluate the method on an ischemic stroke lesion
segmentation task in T1-weighted brain MRI. Results show improved pixel-level
anomaly segmentation in both chest CTs and brain MRIs, with relative DICE score
improvements of +1.9% and +4.4%, respectively, compared to other
state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T-SiamTPN是一个时间感知的Siamese跟踪框架，通过显式时间建模解决了空中目标跟踪中的尺度变化、动态背景和遮挡问题，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跟踪器大多关注空间线索而忽略时间依赖关系，导致长期跟踪和遮挡情况下鲁棒性有限。基于相关的Siamese跟踪器受限于线性相关操作，难以处理复杂的非线性外观变化。

Method: 扩展SiamTPN架构，引入显式时间建模，包括时间特征融合和基于注意力的交互机制，增强时间一致性和特征表示能力。

Result: 相比基线方法，T-SiamTPN成功率和精度分别提升13.7%和14.7%，在Jetson Nano上实现7.1 FPS的实时性能，计算效率得到保持。

Conclusion: 时间建模对Siamese跟踪框架至关重要，T-SiamTPN为空中目标跟踪提供了一个强大且高效的解决方案，适合实际嵌入式应用。

Abstract: Aerial object tracking remains a challenging task due to scale variations,
dynamic backgrounds, clutter, and frequent occlusions. While most existing
trackers emphasize spatial cues, they often overlook temporal dependencies,
resulting in limited robustness in long-term tracking and under occlusion.
Furthermore, correlation-based Siamese trackers are inherently constrained by
the linear nature of correlation operations, making them ineffective against
complex, non-linear appearance changes. To address these limitations, we
introduce T-SiamTPN, a temporal-aware Siamese tracking framework that extends
the SiamTPN architecture with explicit temporal modeling. Our approach
incorporates temporal feature fusion and attention-based interactions,
strengthening temporal consistency and enabling richer feature representations.
These enhancements yield significant improvements over the baseline and achieve
performance competitive with state-of-the-art trackers. Crucially, despite the
added temporal modules, T-SiamTPN preserves computational efficiency. Deployed
on the resource-constrained Jetson Nano, the tracker runs in real time at 7.1
FPS, demonstrating its suitability for real-world embedded applications without
notable runtime overhead. Experimental results highlight substantial gains:
compared to the baseline, T-SiamTPN improves success rate by 13.7% and
precision by 14.7%. These findings underscore the importance of temporal
modeling in Siamese tracking frameworks and establish T-SiamTPN as a strong and
efficient solution for aerial object tracking. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对YOLOv8的三阶段压缩管道，结合稀疏感知训练、结构化通道剪枝和通道知识蒸馏，在VisDrone数据集上实现73.51%参数减少的同时仅降低2.7% AP50，推理速度从26FPS提升至68FPS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限设备上高效部署深度学习模型进行空中目标检测需要在不影响性能的情况下实现显著压缩。

Method: 三阶段压缩管道：1) 稀疏感知训练引入动态稀疏性；2) 利用批量归一化缩放因子进行结构化通道剪枝；3) 使用可调节温度和损失加权的通道知识蒸馏来缓解精度下降。

Result: YOLOv8m参数从25.85M减少到6.85M(减少73.51%)，FLOPs从49.6G降到13.3G，MACs从101G降到34.5G，AP50仅下降2.7%达到47.9，推理速度从26FPS提升到45FPS。使用TensorRT后进一步提升到68FPS。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高效的模型压缩，显著减少了计算复杂度和模型大小，同时保持了良好的检测精度，适合资源受限的高吞吐量场景部署。

Abstract: Efficient deployment of deep learning models for aerial object detection on
resource-constrained devices requires significant compression without
com-promising performance. In this study, we propose a novel three-stage
compression pipeline for the YOLOv8 object detection model, integrating
sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge
Distillation (CWD). First, sparsity-aware training introduces dynamic sparsity
during model optimization, effectively balancing parameter reduction and
detection accuracy. Second, we apply structured channel pruning by leveraging
batch normalization scaling factors to eliminate redundant channels,
significantly reducing model size and computational complexity. Finally, to
mitigate the accuracy drop caused by pruning, we employ CWD to transfer
knowledge from the original model, using an adjustable temperature and loss
weighting scheme tailored for small and medium object detection. Extensive
experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach across multiple YOLOv8 variants. For YOLOv8m, our method reduces model
parameters from 25.85M to 6.85M (a 73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to
13.3G, and MACs from 101G to 34.5G, while reducing AP50 by only 2.7%. The
resulting compressed model achieves 47.9 AP50 and boosts inference speed from
26 FPS (YOLOv8m baseline) to 45 FPS, enabling real-time deployment on edge
devices. We further apply TensorRT as a lightweight optimization step. While
this introduces a minor drop in AP50 (from 47.9 to 47.6), it significantly
improves inference speed from 45 to 68 FPS, demonstrating the practicality of
our approach for high-throughput, re-source-constrained scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于回归的点云配准质量验证方法，相比现有的分类方法能够更精细地量化配准质量，通过多尺度特征提取和注意力聚合机制，在异质空间密度的点云上实现了准确鲁棒的配准误差估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将点云配准质量验证视为分类任务，只能将质量分配到有限的几个类别中，无法进行精细量化。本文希望通过回归方法实现更细粒度的配准质量量化，并改进特征提取方法以处理异质空间密度的点云。

Method: 使用回归方法进行点云配准质量验证，扩展了先前使用的错配相关特征，采用多尺度特征提取和基于注意力的聚合机制，提高了对异质空间密度点云的适应性。

Result: 在多样化数据集上实现了准确和鲁棒的配准误差估计，特别是在具有异质空间密度的点云上表现优异。当用于指导下游建图任务时，相比最先进的基于分类的方法，在给定重配准帧数的情况下显著提高了建图质量。

Conclusion: 回归方法比分类方法更适合点云配准质量验证任务，能够提供更精细的质量量化，多尺度特征提取和注意力聚合机制有效提升了模型性能，特别是在处理异质密度点云时表现突出。

Abstract: Point cloud registration (PCR) is crucial for many downstream tasks, such as
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and object tracking. This makes
detecting and quantifying registration misalignment, i.e.,~{\it PCR quality
validation}, an important task. All existing methods treat validation as a
classification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this
work, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more
fine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend
previously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction
and attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration
error estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with
heterogeneous spatial densities. Furthermore, when used to guide a mapping
downstream task, our method significantly improves the mapping quality for a
given amount of re-registered frames, compared to the state-of-the-art
classification-based method.

Motivation: 现有的自监督3D重建方法在动态物体重建方面存在困难，主要由于运动估计不精确和时间一致性弱，导致动态场景元素的重建不完整或扭曲。

Method: 提出4D雷达辅助的高斯初始化方案，利用4D雷达的速度和空间信息分割动态物体并恢复单目深度尺度；开发速度引导的点跟踪模型(VGPT)，在场景流监督下联合训练，跟踪细粒度动态轨迹并构建时间一致的表示。

Result: 在OmniHD-Scenes数据集上评估，4DRadar-GS在动态驾驶场景3D重建方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 4DRadar-GS通过整合4D雷达信息，有效解决了动态驾驶场景中3D重建的挑战，为自动驾驶系统的验证和感知模型训练提供了更准确的动态场景重建能力。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis are critical for validating
autonomous driving systems and training advanced perception models. Recent
self-supervised methods have gained significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and enhanced generalization in scenarios where annotated
bounding boxes are unavailable. However, existing approaches, which often rely
on frequency-domain decoupling or optical flow, struggle to accurately
reconstruct dynamic objects due to imprecise motion estimation and weak
temporal consistency, resulting in incomplete or distorted representations of
dynamic scene elements. To address these challenges, we propose 4DRadar-GS, a
4D Radar-augmented self-supervised 3D reconstruction framework tailored for
dynamic driving scenes. Specifically, we first present a 4D Radar-assisted
Gaussian initialization scheme that leverages 4D Radar's velocity and spatial
information to segment dynamic objects and recover monocular depth scale,
generating accurate Gaussian point representations. In addition, we propose a
Velocity-guided PointTrack (VGPT) model, which is jointly trained with the
reconstruction pipeline under scene flow supervision, to track fine-grained
dynamic trajectories and construct temporally consistent representations.
Evaluated on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset, 4DRadar-GS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in dynamic driving scene 3D reconstruction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预分解对象级高斯和CLIP特征聚合的新方法，用于3D场景的开放词汇对象检索和分割，避免了传统基于alpha混合的语义学习限制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术在实时逼真渲染方面取得显著进展，但其固有的模糊性阻碍了3D场景理解，限制了在AR/VR和机器人领域的应用。现有方法通过2D基础模型蒸馏学习语义，但alpha混合会平均跨对象语义，无法实现真正的3D级理解

Method: 利用预分解的对象级高斯，通过多视角CLIP特征聚合为每个对象创建全面的"嵌入包"，完全绕过可微分渲染进行语义学习。支持文本查询与对象级嵌入比较进行开放词汇对象检索，以及将对象ID传播到像素进行2D分割或到高斯进行3D提取

Result: 实验表明该方法有效克服了3D开放词汇对象提取的挑战，同时在2D开放词汇分割方面与最先进方法性能相当，确保最小化性能妥协

Conclusion: 该方法为3D场景理解提供了范式转换的替代方案，通过对象级特征聚合实现了准确的开放词汇对象检索和灵活的任务适应能力，为AR/VR和机器人应用提供了更好的3D理解基础

Abstract: Novel view synthesis has seen significant advancements with 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS), enabling real-time photorealistic rendering. However, the
inherent fuzziness of Gaussian Splatting presents challenges for 3D scene
understanding, restricting its broader applications in AR/VR and robotics.
While recent works attempt to learn semantics via 2D foundation model
distillation, they inherit fundamental limitations: alpha blending averages
semantics across objects, making 3D-level understanding impossible. We propose
a paradigm-shifting alternative that bypasses differentiable rendering for
semantics entirely. Our key insight is to leverage predecomposed object-level
Gaussians and represent each object through multiview CLIP feature aggregation,
creating comprehensive "bags of embeddings" that holistically describe objects.
This allows: (1) accurate open-vocabulary object retrieval by comparing text
queries to object-level (not Gaussian-level) embeddings, and (2) seamless task
adaptation: propagating object IDs to pixels for 2D segmentation or to
Gaussians for 3D extraction. Experiments demonstrate that our method
effectively overcomes the challenges of 3D open-vocabulary object extraction
while remaining comparable to state-of-the-art performance in 2D
open-vocabulary segmentation, ensuring minimal compromise.

Conclusion: 该方法通过时间步混合和模态感知学习目标，有效解决了跨模态知识迁移中的分布差异问题，为事件相机与SNNs的高效能视觉处理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The integration of event cameras and spiking neural networks holds great
promise for energy-efficient visual processing. However, the limited
availability of event data and the sparse nature of DVS outputs pose challenges
for effective training. Although some prior work has attempted to transfer
semantic knowledge from RGB datasets to DVS, they often overlook the
significant distribution gap between the two modalities. In this paper, we
propose Time-step Mixup knowledge transfer (TMKT), a novel fine-grained mixing
strategy that exploits the asynchronous nature of SNNs by interpolating RGB and
DVS inputs at various time-steps. To enable label mixing in cross-modal
scenarios, we further introduce modality-aware auxiliary learning objectives.
These objectives support the time-step mixup process and enhance the model's
ability to discriminate effectively across different modalities. Our approach
enables smoother knowledge transfer, alleviates modality shift during training,
and achieves superior performance in spiking image classification tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across
multiple datasets. The code will be released after the double-blind review
process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多表面同时存在的复杂图像分割问题，这些表面可能高度纠缠和相邻，需要新的评估指标和方法来处理这种挑战性场景。

Method: 设计了一个网络架构，输入包括RGB图像、多个非RGB模态、错误掩码和编码点击信息，通过多模态融合策略在图像特征提取后整合交互信息，满足RGB主干网络为黑盒和减少响应时间的要求。

Result: 在DeLiVER数据集上平均每表面减少1.28次点击(NoC@90)，在MFNet数据集上减少1.19次点击，RGB-only基线在传统单掩码交互分割场景中也表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法在多模态多表面交互分割任务中有效，多模态融合策略显著提升了分割性能，同时保持了在传统场景下的竞争力。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a method to interactively create segmentation masks
on the basis of user clicks. We pay particular attention to the segmentation of
multiple surfaces that are simultaneously present in the same image. Since
these surfaces may be heavily entangled and adjacent, we also present a novel
extended evaluation metric that accounts for the challenges of this scenario.
Additionally, the presented method is able to use multi-modal inputs to
facilitate the segmentation task. At the center of this method is a network
architecture which takes as input an RGB image, a number of non-RGB modalities,
an erroneous mask, and encoded clicks. Based on this input, the network
predicts an improved segmentation mask. We design our architecture such that it
adheres to two conditions: (1) The RGB backbone is only available as a
black-box. (2) To reduce the response time, we want our model to integrate the
interaction-specific information after the image feature extraction and the
multi-modal fusion. We refer to the overall task as Multi-Modal Multi-Surface
interactive segmentation (MMMS). We are able to show the effectiveness of our
multi-modal fusion strategy. Using additional modalities, our system reduces
the NoC@90 by up to 1.28 clicks per surface on average on DeLiVER and up to
1.19 on MFNet. On top of this, we are able to show that our RGB-only baseline
achieves competitive, and in some cases even superior performance when tested
in a classical, single-mask interactive segmentation scenario.

Abstract: Text line segmentation is a critical step in handwritten document image
analysis. Segmenting text lines in historical handwritten documents, however,
presents unique challenges due to irregular handwriting, faded ink, and complex
layouts with overlapping lines and non-linear text flow. Furthermore, the
scarcity of large annotated datasets renders fully supervised learning
approaches impractical for such materials. To address these challenges, we
introduce the Few-Shot Text Line Segmentation of Ancient Handwritten Documents
(FEST) Competition. Participants are tasked with developing systems capable of
segmenting text lines in U-DIADS-TL dataset, using only three annotated images
per manuscript for training. The competition dataset features a diverse
collection of ancient manuscripts exhibiting a wide range of layouts,
degradation levels, and non-standard formatting, closely reflecting real-world
conditions. By emphasizing few-shot learning, FEST competition aims to promote
the development of robust and adaptable methods that can be employed by
humanities scholars with minimal manual annotation effort, thus fostering
broader adoption of automated document analysis tools in historical research.

Motivation: 评估蛋白质表面形状检索方法的性能，探索分子表面描述符（特别是静电势能）对检索效果的影响

Method: 使用包含11,555个蛋白质表面的大数据集，计算静电势能作为关键分子表面描述符，通过准确率、平衡准确率、F1分数、精确率和召回率等指标评估15种方法的检索性能

Result: 结合静电势能与分子表面形状的方法取得了最佳检索性能，在数据有限的类别中同样有效

Conclusion: 考虑额外的分子表面描述符（如静电势能）对于提高蛋白质表面形状检索性能至关重要

Abstract: This SHREC 2025 track dedicated to protein surface shape retrieval involved 9
participating teams. We evaluated the performance in retrieval of 15 proposed
methods on a large dataset of 11,555 protein surfaces with calculated
electrostatic potential (a key molecular surface descriptor). The performance
in retrieval of the proposed methods was evaluated through different metrics
(Accuracy, Balanced accuracy, F1 score, Precision and Recall). The best
retrieval performance was achieved by the proposed methods that used the
electrostatic potential complementary to molecular surface shape. This
observation was also valid for classes with limited data which highlights the
importance of taking into account additional molecular surface descriptors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WINNER提出了一种针对SIREN网络的权重初始化方法，通过高斯噪声扰动来解决频谱瓶颈问题，在音频、图像和3D形状拟合任务中取得了显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SIREN网络在初始化不当时会出现频谱瓶颈现象，当网络频率支持与目标频谱不匹配时，模型输出接近零，无法恢复其表示能力范围内的频率分量

Method: WINNER方法对均匀初始化的SIREN权重进行高斯噪声扰动，噪声尺度根据目标信号的频谱质心自适应确定，类似于随机傅里叶嵌入但无需额外可训练参数

Result: 该方法在音频拟合任务中达到最先进水平，在图像和3D形状拟合任务中相比基础SIREN有显著提升

Conclusion: WINNER不仅解决了SIREN的频谱瓶颈问题，还为深度神经网络训练提供了新的自适应、目标感知初始化策略方向

Abstract: We identify and address a fundamental limitation of sinusoidal representation
networks (SIRENs), a class of implicit neural representations. SIRENs Sitzmann
et al. (2020), when not initialized appropriately, can struggle at fitting
signals that fall outside their frequency support. In extreme cases, when the
network's frequency support misaligns with the target spectrum, a 'spectral
bottleneck' phenomenon is observed, where the model yields to a near-zero
output and fails to recover even the frequency components that are within its
representational capacity. To overcome this, we propose WINNER - Weight
Initialization with Noise for Neural Representations. WINNER perturbs uniformly
initialized weights of base SIREN with Gaussian noise - whose noise scales are
adaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal. Similar to
random Fourier embeddings, this mitigates 'spectral bias' but without
introducing additional trainable parameters. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art audio fitting and significant gains in image and 3D shape
fitting tasks over base SIREN. Beyond signal fitting, WINNER suggests new
avenues in adaptive, target-aware initialization strategies for optimizing deep
neural network training. For code and data visit

Conclusion: 全景视觉在具身AI时代具有重要价值，但仍面临诸多挑战，需要进一步研究来构建鲁棒、通用的全景AI系统。

Abstract: Omnidirectional vision, using 360-degree vision to understand the
environment, has become increasingly critical across domains like robotics,
industrial inspection, and environmental monitoring. Compared to traditional
pinhole vision, omnidirectional vision provides holistic environmental
awareness, significantly enhancing the completeness of scene perception and the
reliability of decision-making. However, foundational research in this area has
historically lagged behind traditional pinhole vision. This talk presents an
emerging trend in the embodied AI era: the rapid development of omnidirectional
vision, driven by growing industrial demand and academic interest. We highlight
recent breakthroughs in omnidirectional generation, omnidirectional perception,
omnidirectional understanding, and related datasets. Drawing on insights from
both academia and industry, we propose an ideal panoramic system architecture
in the embodied AI era, PANORAMA, which consists of four key subsystems.
Moreover, we offer in-depth opinions related to emerging trends and
cross-community impacts at the intersection of panoramic vision and embodied
AI, along with the future roadmap and open challenges. This overview
synthesizes state-of-the-art advancements and outlines challenges and
opportunities for future research in building robust, general-purpose
omnidirectional AI systems in the embodied AI era.

Abstract: In this report, we address the problem of determining whether a user performs
an action incorrectly from egocentric video data. To handle the challenges
posed by subtle and infrequent mistakes, we propose a Dual-Stage Reweighted
Mixture-of-Experts (DR-MoE) framework. In the first stage, features are
extracted using a frozen ViViT model and a LoRA-tuned ViViT model, which are
combined through a feature-level expert module. In the second stage, three
classifiers are trained with different objectives: reweighted cross-entropy to
mitigate class imbalance, AUC loss to improve ranking under skewed
distributions, and label-aware loss with sharpness-aware minimization to
enhance calibration and generalization. Their predictions are fused using a
classification-level expert module. The proposed method achieves strong
performance, particularly in identifying rare and ambiguous mistake instances.

*Yue Zhou,Xinan He,Kaiqing Lin,Bing Fan,Feng Ding,Jinhua Zeng,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于现代视觉基础模型(VFM)的简单线性分类器在AI生成图像检测任务上显著优于专用检测器，在真实场景中准确率提升超过20%，关键在于VFM通过预训练学习到了伪造相关概念的对齐能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有专用AI生成图像检测器在精心设计的基准测试上表现优异，但在真实场景中失败率很高，需要寻找更有效的解决方案

Method: 使用现代视觉基础模型(VFM)作为特征提取器，在其上训练简单的线性分类器进行AI生成图像检测，并通过文本-图像相似性分析探究模型能力来源

Result: 该方法在真实场景基准测试中准确率比专用检测器提升超过20%，分析发现现代VLM学会了将合成图像与伪造相关概念对齐，但这种能力依赖于预训练数据的时间范围

Conclusion: 现代VFM的原始"火力"比静态检测器的"工艺"更有效，真正的泛化评估需要测试数据独立于模型的整个训练历史（包括预训练）

Abstract: While specialized detectors for AI-generated images excel on curated
benchmarks, they fail catastrophically in real-world scenarios, as evidenced by
their critically high false-negative rates on `in-the-wild' benchmarks. Instead
of crafting another specialized `knife' for this problem, we bring a `gun' to
the fight: a simple linear classifier on a modern Vision Foundation Model
(VFM). Trained on identical data, this baseline decisively `outguns' bespoke
detectors, boosting in-the-wild accuracy by a striking margin of over 20\%.
  Our analysis pinpoints the source of the VFM's `firepower': First, by probing
text-image similarities, we find that recent VLMs (e.g., Perception Encoder,
Meta CLIP2) have learned to align synthetic images with forgery-related
concepts (e.g., `AI-generated'), unlike previous versions. Second, we speculate
that this is due to data exposure, as both this alignment and overall accuracy
plummet on a novel dataset scraped after the VFM's pre-training cut-off date,
ensuring it was unseen during pre-training. Our findings yield two critical
conclusions: 1) For the real-world `gunfight' of AI-generated image detection,
the raw `firepower' of an updated VFM is far more effective than the
`craftsmanship' of a static detector. 2) True generalization evaluation
requires test data to be independent of the model's entire training history,
including pre-training.

Motivation: 小型无人机对军事人员和民用基础设施构成日益增长的威胁，需要早期自动化检测

Method: 使用脉冲神经网络和神经形态相机构建检测系统，部署在神经形态芯片上，可通过合成生成数据训练，多个检测单元可创建虚拟绊网

Result: 系统能耗比边缘GPU解决方案低几个数量级，可电池供电运行超过一年，模型主要依赖无人机形状而非螺旋桨时间特征

Conclusion: 该系统体积小、功耗低，可在争议区域或缺乏电力基础设施的地点轻松部署，为无人机检测提供了高效的神经形态解决方案

Abstract: Small drones are an increasing threat to both military personnel and civilian
infrastructure, making early and automated detection crucial. In this work we
develop a system that uses spiking neural networks and neuromorphic cameras
(event cameras) to detect drones. The detection model is deployed on a
neuromorphic chip making this a fully neuromorphic system. Multiple detection
units can be deployed to create a virtual tripwire which detects when and where
drones enter a restricted zone. We show that our neuromorphic solution is
several orders of magnitude more energy efficient than a reference solution
deployed on an edge GPU, allowing the system to run for over a year on battery
power. We investigate how synthetically generated data can be used for
training, and show that our model most likely relies on the shape of the drone
rather than the temporal characteristics of its propellers. The small size and
low power consumption allows easy deployment in contested areas or locations
that lack power infrastructure.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dream3DAvatar是一个高效、文本可控的两阶段3D头像生成框架，通过多视图生成和3D高斯重建，解决了单图像重建中遮挡区域几何纹理控制的难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单图像3D头像重建任务由于单目输入信息有限，在生成过程中难以控制遮挡区域的几何和纹理，存在根本性的不适定性问题。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段使用轻量级适配器增强的多视图生成模型（Pose-Adapter和ID-Adapter-G），第二阶段使用前馈Transformer模型进行3D高斯重建（包含多视图特征融合模块和ID-Adapter-R）。

Result: 实验表明该方法能够生成真实、可直接动画化的3D头像，无需后处理，并在多个评估指标上持续优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: Dream3DAvatar通过创新的适配器设计和两阶段流程，有效解决了单图像3D头像重建中的遮挡区域控制问题，实现了高质量的文本可控3D头像生成。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of 3D representation techniques and generative
models, substantial progress has been made in reconstructing full-body 3D
avatars from a single image. However, this task remains fundamentally
ill-posedness due to the limited information available from monocular input,
making it difficult to control the geometry and texture of occluded regions
during generation. To address these challenges, we redesign the reconstruction
pipeline and propose Dream3DAvatar, an efficient and text-controllable
two-stage framework for 3D avatar generation. In the first stage, we develop a
lightweight, adapter-enhanced multi-view generation model. Specifically, we
introduce the Pose-Adapter to inject SMPL-X renderings and skeletal information
into SDXL, enforcing geometric and pose consistency across views. To preserve
facial identity, we incorporate ID-Adapter-G, which injects high-resolution
facial features into the generation process. Additionally, we leverage BLIP2 to
generate high-quality textual descriptions of the multi-view images, enhancing
text-driven controllability in occluded regions. In the second stage, we design
a feedforward Transformer model equipped with a multi-view feature fusion
module to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian Splat representations (3DGS)
from the generated images. Furthermore, we introduce ID-Adapter-R, which
utilizes a gating mechanism to effectively fuse facial features into the
reconstruction process, improving high-frequency detail recovery. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can generate realistic, animation-ready
3D avatars without any post-processing and consistently outperforms existing
baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接将LLM的RL技术移植到VLM效果不佳，因为VLM任务更复杂，需要先准确感知视觉输入才能进行有效推理

Method: 两阶段强化学习框架：第一阶段通过粗粒度和细粒度视觉理解提升视觉感知能力；第二阶段增强推理能力；采用数据集级采样缓解RL训练中的优势消失问题

Result: 实验结果表明该方法有效，PeBR-R1在多种视觉推理任务上表现出优越性能

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段强化学习框架成功提升了VLM的感知和推理能力，为复杂视觉语言任务提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in eliciting the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this
success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to
vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance.
However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as
the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must
first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be
effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage
reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing
advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform
dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using
distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving
the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual
understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning
abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we
obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual
and reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior
performance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: HERO是一个高分辨率视觉标记早期丢弃框架，通过内容自适应标记预算分配和功能感知标记选择，在HR-LVLMs中实现高效推理，无需训练即可获得优越的效率-准确性权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率大视觉语言模型通过将高分辨率图像裁剪成本地图块并独立编码，展现出卓越的细粒度视觉理解能力，但这种分治范式显著增加了视觉标记数量，导致计算和内存开销大幅增加。

Method: 基于对HR-LVLMs中视觉标记利用的实证研究，提出HERO框架，整合内容自适应标记预算分配和功能感知标记选择，准确估计图块级别重要性并选择性保留具有互补作用的视觉标记。

Result: HERO在多样化基准测试和模型规模上实现了优越的效率-准确性权衡，所有操作均无需训练。

Conclusion: 该研究为HR-LVLMs中的高效推理提供了实证见解和实用解决方案，通过选择性视觉标记丢弃显著降低了计算开销。

Abstract: By cropping high-resolution images into local tiles and encoding them
independently, High-Resolution Large Vision-Language Models (HR-LVLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable fine-grained visual understanding capabilities.
However, this divide-and-conquer paradigm significantly increases the number of
visual tokens, resulting in substantial computational and memory overhead. To
better understand and address this challenge, we empirically investigate visual
token utilization in HR-LVLMs and uncover three key findings: (1) the local
tiles have varying importance, jointly determined by visual saliency and task
relevance; (2) the CLS token in CLIP-based vision encoders exhibits a two-stage
attention pattern across layers, with each stage attending to different types
of visual tokens; (3) the visual tokens emphasized at different stages encode
information at varying levels of granularity, playing complementary roles
within LVLMs. Building on these insights, we propose HERO, a High-resolution
visual token early dropping framework that integrates content-adaptive token
budget allocation with function-aware token selection. By accurately estimating
tile-level importance and selectively retaining visual tokens with
complementary roles, HERO achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs
across diverse benchmarks and model scales, all in a training-free manner. This
study provides both empirical insights and practical solutions toward efficient
inference in HR-LVLMs.

TL;DR: TFANet是一个三阶段图像-文本特征对齐网络，通过分层框架解决指代图像分割中的多模态对齐问题，包含知识增强、知识融合和知识强化三个阶段，使用多尺度线性交叉注意力和跨模态特征扫描等技术提升复杂场景下的分割精度。

Result: 该方法系统性地增强了多模态对齐能力，建立了图像区域与不同粒度语言描述之间的丰富对齐，能够更好地处理复杂场景中的长距离跨模态依赖关系。

Conclusion: TFANet通过三阶段分层对齐框架有效解决了指代图像分割中的多模态错位和语义损失问题，特别是在复杂多对象场景中表现出更好的分割性能。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a task that segments image regions
based on language expressions, requiring fine-grained alignment between two
modalities. However, existing methods often struggle with multimodal
misalignment and language semantic loss, especially in complex scenes
containing multiple visually similar objects, where uniquely described targets
are frequently mislocalized or incompletely segmented. To tackle these
challenges, this paper proposes TFANet, a Three-stage Image-Text Feature
Alignment Network that systematically enhances multimodal alignment through a
hierarchical framework comprising three stages: Knowledge Plus Stage (KPS),
Knowledge Fusion Stage (KFS), and Knowledge Intensification Stage (KIS). In the
first stage, we design the Multiscale Linear Cross-Attention Module (MLAM),
which facilitates bidirectional semantic exchange between visual features and
textual representations across multiple scales. This establishes rich and
efficient alignment between image regions and different granularities of
linguistic descriptions. Subsequently, the KFS further strengthens feature
alignment through the Cross-modal Feature Scanning Module (CFSM), which applies
multimodal selective scanning to capture long-range dependencies and construct
a unified multimodal representation. This is essential for modeling long-range
cross-modal dependencies and enhancing alignment accuracy in complex scenes.
Finally, in the KIS, we propose the Word-level Linguistic Feature-guided
Semantic Deepening Module (WFDM) to compensate for semantic degradation
introduced in earlier stages.

Motivation: 传统傅里叶频率信息拟合使用逐像素损失函数，过度关注局部信息可能导致全局信息丢失，需要更有效的傅里叶域信息对齐方法。

Method: 提出U形深度增强网络LLFDisc，集成交叉注意力和门控机制；设计分布感知损失函数，使用闭式KL散度目标最小化傅里叶域信息差异；在VGG提取的深度特征中嵌入KL散度来增强感知损失。

Result: 在多个基准测试的定性和定量评估中均达到最先进性能，证明了该方法在傅里叶域信息对齐方面的优越性。

Conclusion: LLFDisc通过创新的分布感知损失和网络架构设计，能够更鲁棒地对齐傅里叶域信息，在频率感知增强任务中表现出色。

Abstract: In the Fourier domain, luminance information is primarily encoded in the
amplitude spectrum, while spatial structures are captured in the phase
components. The traditional Fourier Frequency information fitting employs
pixel-wise loss functions, which tend to focus excessively on local information
and may lead to global information loss. In this paper, we present LLFDisc, a
U-shaped deep enhancement network that integrates cross-attention and gating
mechanisms tailored for frequency-aware enhancement. We propose a novel
distribution-aware loss that directly fits the Fourier-domain information and
minimizes their divergence using a closed-form KL-Divergence objective. This
enables the model to align Fourier-domain information more robustly than with
conventional MSE-based losses. Furthermore, we enhance the perceptual loss
based on VGG by embedding KL-Divergence on extracted deep features, enabling
better structural fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that LLFDisc achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Our code will be released at:

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of supervised medical image segmentation
models, relying on a large amount of labeled data is impractical in real-world
situations. Semi-supervised learning approaches aim to alleviate this challenge
using unlabeled data through pseudo-label generation. Yet, existing
semi-supervised segmentation methods still suffer from noisy pseudo-labels and
insufficient supervision within the feature space. To solve these challenges,
this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation
framework based on a dual-network architecture. Specifically, we investigate a
Cross Consistency Enhancement module using both cross pseudo and
entropy-filtered supervision to reduce the noisy pseudo-labels, while we design
a dynamic weighting strategy to adjust the contributions of pseudo-labels using
an uncertainty-aware mechanism (i.e., Kullback-Leibler divergence). In
addition, we use a self-supervised contrastive learning mechanism to align
uncertain voxel features with reliable class prototypes by effectively
differentiating between trustworthy and uncertain predictions, thus reducing
prediction uncertainty. Extensive experiments are conducted on three 3D
segmentation datasets, Left Atrial, NIH Pancreas and BraTS-2019. The proposed
approach consistently exhibits superior performance across various settings
(e.g., 89.95\% Dice score on left Atrial with 10\% labeled data) compared to
the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the usefulness of the proposed
modules is further validated via ablation experiments.

Abstract: Quality control of assembly processes is essential in manufacturing to ensure
not only the quality of individual components but also their proper integration
into the final product. To assist in this matter, automated assembly control
using computer vision methods has been widely implemented. However, the costs
associated with image acquisition, annotation, and training of computer vision
algorithms pose challenges for integration, especially for small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often lack the resources for extensive
training, data collection, and manual image annotation. Synthetic data offers
the potential to reduce manual data collection and labeling. Nevertheless, its
practical application in the context of assembly quality remains limited. In
this work, we present a novel approach for easily integrable and data-efficient
visual assembly control. Our approach leverages simulated scene generation
based on computer-aided design (CAD) data and object detection algorithms. The
results demonstrate a time-saving pipeline for generating image data in
manufacturing environments, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5:0.95)
up to 99,5% for correctly identifying instances of synthetic planetary gear
system components within our simulated training data, and up to 93% when
transferred to real-world camera-captured testing data. This research
highlights the effectiveness of synthetic data generation within an adaptable
pipeline and underscores its potential to support SMEs in implementing
resource-efficient visual assembly control solutions.

Abstract: The proliferation of sophisticated deepfake technology poses significant
challenges to digital security and authenticity. Detecting these forgeries,
especially across a wide spectrum of manipulation techniques, requires robust
and generalized models. This paper introduces the Hierarchical Deep Fusion
Framework (HDFF), an ensemble-based deep learning architecture designed for
high-performance facial forgery detection. Our framework integrates four
diverse pre-trained sub-models, Swin-MLP, CoAtNet, EfficientNetV2, and DaViT,
which are meticulously fine-tuned through a multi-stage process on the
MultiFFDI dataset. By concatenating the feature representations from these
specialized models and training a final classifier layer, HDFF effectively
leverages their collective strengths. This approach achieved a final score of
0.96852 on the competition's private leaderboard, securing the 20th position
out of 184 teams, demonstrating the efficacy of hierarchical fusion for complex
image classification tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种弱监督和自监督的类无关运动预测方法，使用前景/背景或非地面/地面掩码替代运动标注，显著减少标注工作量，同时保持与监督方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要理解动态环境中的运动，但获取运动标注成本高昂。室外场景通常包含移动前景和静态背景，因此可以通过场景解析来关联运动理解，从而减少对运动标注的依赖。

Method: 提出弱监督范式，用全标注或部分标注(1%, 0.1%)的前景/背景掩码替代运动标注；利用非地面/地面掩码进一步减少标注需求(0.01%)；设计自监督方法无需标注；提出鲁棒一致性感知Chamfer距离损失，整合多帧信息并抑制异常值。

Result: 实验表明，弱监督和自监督模型优于现有的自监督方法，弱监督模型甚至可与某些监督方法相媲美，有效平衡了标注工作量与性能。

Conclusion: 通过利用场景解析线索，提出的弱监督和自监督方法能够以较少的标注成本实现有效的运动预测，为自动驾驶中的运动理解提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding motion in dynamic environments is critical for autonomous
driving, thereby motivating research on class-agnostic motion prediction. In
this work, we investigate weakly and self-supervised class-agnostic motion
prediction from LiDAR point clouds. Outdoor scenes typically consist of mobile
foregrounds and static backgrounds, allowing motion understanding to be
associated with scene parsing. Based on this observation, we propose a novel
weakly supervised paradigm that replaces motion annotations with fully or
partially annotated (1%, 0.1%) foreground/background masks for supervision. To
this end, we develop a weakly supervised approach utilizing
foreground/background cues to guide the self-supervised learning of motion
prediction models. Since foreground motion generally occurs in non-ground
regions, non-ground/ground masks can serve as an alternative to
foreground/background masks, further reducing annotation effort. Leveraging
non-ground/ground cues, we propose two additional approaches: a weakly
supervised method requiring fewer (0.01%) foreground/background annotations,
and a self-supervised method without annotations. Furthermore, we design a
Robust Consistency-aware Chamfer Distance loss that incorporates multi-frame
information and robust penalty functions to suppress outliers in
self-supervised learning. Experiments show that our weakly and self-supervised
models outperform existing self-supervised counterparts, and our weakly
supervised models even rival some supervised ones. This demonstrates that our
approaches effectively balance annotation effort and performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文构建了大规模停车位检测数据集CRPS-D，并提出首个半监督停车位检测方法SS-PSD，通过教师-学生模型和置信度引导的掩码一致性提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有停车位检测数据集规模有限，缺乏真实世界噪声干扰，且人工标注成本高、易出错，需要构建更大规模数据集并开发更高效的检测方法。

Method: 首先构建包含多种光照、天气条件和挑战性停车位变体的大规模数据集CRPS-D；然后提出基于教师-学生模型的半监督检测方法SS-PSD，采用置信度引导掩码一致性和自适应特征扰动技术。

Result: 实验结果表明SS-PSD在提出的数据集和现有数据集上都优于现有最优方法，特别是在使用更多未标注数据时性能提升更显著。

Conclusion: CRPS-D数据集和SS-PSD方法有效解决了停车位检测中的数据稀缺和标注成本问题，为自动停车系统提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: As automatic parking systems evolve, the accurate detection of parking slots
has become increasingly critical. This study focuses on parking slot detection
using surround-view cameras, which offer a comprehensive bird's-eye view of the
parking environment. However, the current datasets are limited in scale, and
the scenes they contain are seldom disrupted by real-world noise (e.g., light,
occlusion, etc.). Moreover, manual data annotation is prone to errors and
omissions due to the complexity of real-world conditions, significantly
increasing the cost of annotating large-scale datasets. To address these
issues, we first construct a large-scale parking slot detection dataset (named
CRPS-D), which includes various lighting distributions, diverse weather
conditions, and challenging parking slot variants. Compared with existing
datasets, the proposed dataset boasts the largest data scale and consists of a
higher density of parking slots, particularly featuring more slanted parking
slots. Additionally, we develop a semi-supervised baseline for parking slot
detection, termed SS-PSD, to further improve performance by exploiting
unlabeled data. To our knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised approach in
parking slot detection, which is built on the teacher-student model with
confidence-guided mask consistency and adaptive feature perturbation.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SS-PSD over the existing
state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions on both the proposed dataset and the existing
dataset. Particularly, the more unlabeled data there is, the more significant
the gains brought by our semi-supervised scheme. The relevant source codes and
the dataset have been made publicly available at

TL;DR: MSDNet是一个多阶段蒸馏框架，通过将密集LiDAR先验知识转移到4D雷达特征中，实现高保真点云超分辨重建和低延迟推理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有4D雷达超分辨方法存在训练成本高、推理延迟大、泛化能力差的问题，难以平衡准确性和效率

Method: 采用两阶段蒸馏：第一阶段通过重建引导的特征蒸馏对齐和密集化特征；第二阶段通过扩散引导的特征蒸馏和噪声适配器进行精细化去噪

Result: 在VoD和内部数据集上实现了高保真重建和低延迟推理，下游任务性能持续提升

Conclusion: MSDNet框架有效解决了4D雷达超分辨中准确性与效率的平衡问题，为自动驾驶感知提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: 4D radar super-resolution, which aims to reconstruct sparse and noisy point
clouds into dense and geometrically consistent representations, is a
foundational problem in autonomous perception. However, existing methods often
suffer from high training cost or rely on complex diffusion-based sampling,
resulting in high inference latency and poor generalization, making it
difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose MSDNet, a multi-stage distillation framework that efficiently transfers
dense LiDAR priors to 4D radar features to achieve both high reconstruction
quality and computational efficiency. The first stage performs
reconstruction-guided feature distillation, aligning and densifying the
student's features through feature reconstruction. In the second stage, we
propose diffusion-guided feature distillation, which treats the stage-one
distilled features as a noisy version of the teacher's representations and
refines them via a lightweight diffusion network. Furthermore, we introduce a
noise adapter that adaptively aligns the noise level of the feature with a
predefined diffusion timestep, enabling a more precise denoising. Extensive
experiments on the VoD and in-house datasets demonstrate that MSDNet achieves
both high-fidelity reconstruction and low-latency inference in the task of 4D
radar point cloud super-resolution, and consistently improves performance on
downstream tasks. The code will be publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: Recognizing textual attributes such as bold, italic, underline and strikeout
is essential for understanding text semantics, structure, and visual
presentation. These attributes highlight key information, making them crucial
for document analysis. Existing methods struggle with computational efficiency
or adaptability in noisy, multilingual settings. To address this, we introduce
TexTAR, a multi-task, context-aware Transformer for Textual Attribute

awareness, and our architecture employs a 2D RoPE (Rotary Positional
Embedding)-style mechanism to incorporate input context for more accurate
attribute predictions. We also introduce MMTAD, a diverse, multilingual,
multi-domain dataset annotated with text attributes across real-world documents
such as legal records, notices, and textbooks. Extensive evaluations show
TexTAR outperforms existing methods, demonstrating that contextual awareness
contributes to state-of-the-art TAR performance.

Conclusion: 提出的多视频协作框架通过结构化表示和融合多个视频的信息，有效解决了视频语言模型中的时空不完整性问题，为视频推理提供了更准确和可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the prosperity of the video language model, the current pursuit of
comprehensive video reasoning is thwarted by the inherent spatio-temporal
incompleteness within individual videos, resulting in hallucinations and
inaccuracies. A promising solution is to augment the reasoning performance with
multiple related videos. However, video tokens are numerous and contain
redundant information, so directly feeding the relevant video data into a large
language model to enhance responses could be counterproductive. To address this
challenge, we propose a multi-video collaborative framework for video language
models. For efficient and flexible video representation, we establish a Video
Structuring Module to represent the video's knowledge as a spatio-temporal
graph. Based on the structured video representation, we design the Graph Fusion
Module to fuse the structured knowledge and valuable information from related
videos into the augmented graph node tokens. Finally, we construct an elaborate
multi-video structured prompt to integrate the graph, visual, and textual
tokens as the input to the large language model. Extensive experiments
substantiate the effectiveness of our framework, showcasing its potential as a
promising avenue for advancing video language models.

Abstract: Street trees are vital to urban livability, providing ecological and social
benefits. Establishing a detailed, accurate, and dynamically updated street
tree inventory has become essential for optimizing these multifunctional assets
within space-constrained urban environments. Given that traditional field
surveys are time-consuming and labor-intensive, automated surveys utilizing
Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS) offer a more efficient solution. However, existing
MMS-acquired tree datasets are limited by small-scale scene, limited
annotation, or single modality, restricting their utility for comprehensive
analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce WHU-STree, a cross-city,
richly annotated, and multi-modal urban street tree dataset. Collected across
two distinct cities, WHU-STree integrates synchronized point clouds and
high-resolution images, encompassing 21,007 annotated tree instances across 50
species and 2 morphological parameters. Leveraging the unique characteristics,
WHU-STree concurrently supports over 10 tasks related to street tree inventory.
We benchmark representative baselines for two key tasks--tree species
classification and individual tree segmentation. Extensive experiments and
in-depth analysis demonstrate the significant potential of multi-modal data
fusion and underscore cross-domain applicability as a critical prerequisite for
practical algorithm deployment. In particular, we identify key challenges and
outline potential future works for fully exploiting WHU-STree, encompassing
multi-modal fusion, multi-task collaboration, cross-domain generalization,
spatial pattern learning, and Multi-modal Large Language Model for street tree
asset management. The WHU-STree dataset is accessible at:

Motivation: 大型语言模型的出现为医学对比视觉语言预训练提供了革命性机会，但如何低成本获取大规模标注数据仍是一个挑战

Method: 使用现代LLMs自动从放射报告中提取诊断标签（AUC>96%），创建"银标准"数据集，然后使用3D ResNet-18和标准CLIP训练进行监督预训练

Result: 在CT-RATE上零样本诊断达到83.8% AUC，RAD-ChestCT上77.3% AUC，跨模态检索性能显著提升（图像-图像MAP@50=53.7%，报告-图像Recall@100=52.2%）

Conclusion: LLMs能够以极低成本（约3美元处理5万对CT图像-报告）实现大规模监督预训练，使医学AI系统更加高性能和可扩展

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents unprecedented
opportunities to revolutionize medical contrastive vision-language
pre-training. In this paper, we show how LLMs can facilitate large-scale
supervised pre-training, thereby advancing vision-language alignment. We begin
by demonstrate that modern LLMs can automatically extract diagnostic labels
from radiology reports with remarkable precision (>96\% AUC in our experiments)
without complex prompt engineering, enabling the creation of large-scale
"silver-standard" datasets at a minimal cost (~\$3 for 50k CT image-report
pairs). Further, we find that vision encoder trained on this "silver-standard"
dataset achieves performance comparable to those trained on labels extracted by
specialized BERT-based models, thereby democratizing the access to large-scale
supervised pre-training. Building on this foundation, we proceed to reveal that
supervised pre-training fundamentally improves contrastive vision-language
alignment. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance using only a 3D
ResNet-18 with vanilla CLIP training, including 83.8\% AUC for zero-shot
diagnosis on CT-RATE, 77.3\% AUC on RAD-ChestCT, and substantial improvements
in cross-modal retrieval (MAP@50=53.7\% for image-image, Recall@100=52.2\% for
report-image). These results demonstrate the potential of utilizing LLMs to
facilitate {\bf more performant and scalable} medical AI systems. Our code is

Abstract: With the growing deployment of autonomous driving agents, the detection and
segmentation of road obstacles have become critical to ensure safe autonomous
navigation. However, existing road-obstacle segmentation methods are applied on
individual frames, overlooking the temporal nature of the problem, leading to
inconsistent prediction maps between consecutive frames. In this work, we
demonstrate that the road-obstacle segmentation task is inherently temporal,
since the segmentation maps for consecutive frames are strongly correlated. To
address this, we curate and adapt four evaluation benchmarks for road-obstacle
video segmentation and evaluate 11 state-of-the-art image- and video-based
segmentation methods on these benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce two strong
baseline methods based on vision foundation models. Our approach establishes a
new state-of-the-art in road-obstacle video segmentation for long-range video
sequences, providing valuable insights and direction for future research.

Abstract: The powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models have significantly
advanced the field of image synthesis, enhancing both full image generation and
inpainting-based image editing. Despite their remarkable advancements,
diffusion models also raise concerns about potential misuse for malicious
purposes. However, existing approaches struggle to identify images generated by
diffusion-based inpainting models, even when similar inpainted images are
included in their training data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
detection method based on End-to-end denoising diffusion (End4). Specifically,
End4 designs a denoising reconstruction model to improve the alignment degree
between the latent spaces of the reconstruction and detection processes, thus
reconstructing features that are more conducive to detection. Meanwhile, it
leverages a Scale-aware Pyramid-like Fusion Module (SPFM) that refines local
image features under the guidance of attention pyramid layers at different
scales, enhancing feature discriminability. Additionally, to evaluate detection
performance on inpainted images, we establish a comprehensive benchmark
comprising images generated from five distinct masked regions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our End4 effectively generalizes to unseen masking
patterns and remains robust under various perturbations. Our code and dataset
will be released soon.

Conclusion: CMTSSL在轻量级架构的通用表示学习方面具有巨大潜力，特别适合星上卫星部署的实际高光谱应用

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures detailed spectral signatures across
hundreds of contiguous bands per pixel, being indispensable for remote sensing
applications such as land-cover classification, change detection, and
environmental monitoring. Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the
slow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient
models are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission
of redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we
introduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL)
framework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL
integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw
puzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively
increases data complexity during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to
jointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global
semantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously
addresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally
efficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models
for onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public
benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation
tasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some
state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in
generalizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for
real-world HSI applications. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: Several video understanding tasks, such as natural language temporal video
grounding, temporal activity localization, and audio description generation,
require "temporally dense" reasoning over frames sampled at high temporal
resolution. However, computing frame-level features for these tasks is
computationally expensive given the temporal resolution requirements. In this
paper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for
temporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT)
architecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy
in videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our
architecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure
temporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction
module that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally
redundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model.
Second, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the
frame-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our
approach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully
supervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost
(up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while
closely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model.

TL;DR: RadGame是一个AI驱动的游戏化放射学教育平台，通过定位异常和生成报告两个游戏模块，结合大规模公共数据集和AI自动反馈，显著提升放射学培训效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统放射学培训主要依赖被动案例学习或需要放射科医生实时指导，缺乏即时、可扩展的反馈机制，限制了培训效率和规模。

Method: 开发RadGame平台，包含两个核心模块：1) Localize模块让玩家绘制异常边界框，与放射科医生标注对比并提供视觉解释；2) Report模块让玩家撰写报告，基于放射学报告生成指标提供结构化AI反馈。

Result: 前瞻性评估显示，使用RadGame的参与者在定位准确率上提升68%（传统方法仅17%），在报告写作准确率上提升31%（传统方法仅4%）。

Conclusion: RadGame展示了AI驱动游戏化在提供可扩展、反馈丰富的放射学培训方面的潜力，重新构想了医疗AI资源在教育中的应用方式。

Abstract: We introduce RadGame, an AI-powered gamified platform for radiology education
that targets two core skills: localizing findings and generating reports.
Traditional radiology training is based on passive exposure to cases or active
practice with real-time input from supervising radiologists, limiting
opportunities for immediate and scalable feedback. RadGame addresses this gap
by combining gamification with large-scale public datasets and automated,
AI-driven feedback that provides clear, structured guidance to human learners.
In RadGame Localize, players draw bounding boxes around abnormalities, which
are automatically compared to radiologist-drawn annotations from public
datasets, and visual explanations are generated by vision-language models for
user missed findings. In RadGame Report, players compose findings given a chest
X-ray, patient age and indication, and receive structured AI feedback based on
radiology report generation metrics, highlighting errors and omissions compared
to a radiologist's written ground truth report from public datasets, producing
a final performance and style score. In a prospective evaluation, participants
using RadGame achieved a 68% improvement in localization accuracy compared to
17% with traditional passive methods and a 31% improvement in report-writing
accuracy compared to 4% with traditional methods after seeing the same cases.
RadGame highlights the potential of AI-driven gamification to deliver scalable,
feedback-rich radiology training and reimagines the application of medical AI
resources in education.

TL;DR: 提出一个基于视觉语言模型的多模态框架，用于评估AI生成图像的整体真实性和识别局部视觉不一致区域


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要可靠的方法来量化AI生成图像的感知真实性，并为生成AI训练提供真实度反馈以提升照片真实感

Method: 使用在大规模数据集上训练的视觉语言模型生成视觉不一致的文本描述，作为人类标注的可靠替代，实现整体真实度评估和局部不一致识别

Result: 多模态方法提高了客观真实度预测性能，并生成能够有效区分真实和不真实空间区域的密集真实度图

Conclusion: 该框架为AI生成图像的实用化和生成AI照片真实感的改进提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: A reliable method of quantifying the perceptual realness of AI-generated
images and identifying visually inconsistent regions is crucial for practical
use of AI-generated images and for improving photorealism of generative AI via
realness feedback during training. This paper introduces a framework that
accomplishes both overall objective realness assessment and local inconsistency
identification of AI-generated images using textual descriptions of visual
inconsistencies generated by vision-language models trained on large datasets
that serve as reliable substitutes for human annotations. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed multimodal approach improves objective realness
prediction performance and produces dense realness maps that effectively
distinguish between realistic and unrealistic spatial regions.

TL;DR: StyleSculptor是一种无需训练的零样本方法，通过内容图像和风格图像生成风格可控的3D资产，使用新颖的Style Disentangled Attention模块实现细粒度的纹理和几何风格控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在视频游戏和虚拟现实等应用中，需要创建与现有资产风格一致的3D资产，但现有的3D生成方法难以实现精确的风格控制。

Method: 提出Style Disentangled Attention (SD-Attn)模块，通过跨3D注意力机制实现内容图像和风格图像的动态交互，并引入风格解耦特征选择策略来分离风格和内容特征。

Result: 实验表明StyleSculptor在生成高保真3D资产方面优于现有基线方法，能够实现纹理、几何或两者的精确风格控制。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了无需训练的零样本风格可控3D生成，为3D内容创作提供了灵活的风格控制能力。

Abstract: Creating 3D assets that follow the texture and geometry style of existing
ones is often desirable or even inevitable in practical applications like video
gaming and virtual reality. While impressive progress has been made in
generating 3D objects from text or images, creating style-controllable 3D
assets remains a complex and challenging problem. In this work, we propose
StyleSculptor, a novel training-free approach for generating style-guided 3D
assets from a content image and one or more style images. Unlike previous
works, StyleSculptor achieves style-guided 3D generation in a zero-shot manner,
enabling fine-grained 3D style control that captures the texture, geometry, or
both styles of user-provided style images. At the core of StyleSculptor is a
novel Style Disentangled Attention (SD-Attn) module, which establishes a
dynamic interaction between the input content image and style image for
style-guided 3D asset generation via a cross-3D attention mechanism, enabling
stable feature fusion and effective style-guided generation. To alleviate
semantic content leakage, we also introduce a style-disentangled feature
selection strategy within the SD-Attn module, which leverages the variance of
3D feature patches to disentangle style- and content-significant channels,
allowing selective feature injection within the attention framework. With
SD-Attn, the network can dynamically compute texture-, geometry-, or
both-guided features to steer the 3D generation process. Built upon this, we
further propose the Style Guided Control (SGC) mechanism, which enables
exclusive geometry- or texture-only stylization, as well as adjustable style
intensity control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StyleSculptor
outperforms existing baseline methods in producing high-fidelity 3D assets.

TL;DR: SR-3D是一个连接单视图2D图像和多视图3D数据的视觉语言模型，通过共享视觉标记空间实现灵活的3D区域提示，无需多帧标注即可进行准确的空间推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统方法需要大量多帧标注的问题，以及实现2D和3D表示空间的统一，提升场景理解中空间推理的准确性。

Method: 通过用3D位置嵌入丰富2D视觉特征，使3D模型能够利用强大的2D先验知识，支持边界框、分割掩码或直接3D标注的灵活区域提示。

Result: 在通用2D视觉语言和专门3D空间基准测试中达到最先进性能，能够准确推断空间关系和度量测量，适用于无3D输入或标注的野外视频。

Conclusion: SR-3D有效统一了2D和3D表示空间，为场景理解提供了强大的空间推理能力，具有广泛的适用性和实用性。

Abstract: We present Spatial Region 3D (SR-3D) aware vision-language model that
connects single-view 2D images and multi-view 3D data through a shared visual
token space. SR-3D supports flexible region prompting, allowing users to
annotate regions with bounding boxes, segmentation masks on any frame, or
directly in 3D, without the need for exhaustive multi-frame labeling. We
achieve this by enriching 2D visual features with 3D positional embeddings,
which allows the 3D model to draw upon strong 2D priors for more accurate
spatial reasoning across frames, even when objects of interest do not co-occur
within the same view. Extensive experiments on both general 2D vision language
and specialized 3D spatial benchmarks demonstrate that SR-3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its effectiveness for unifying 2D
and 3D representation space on scene understanding. Moreover, we observe
applicability to in-the-wild videos without sensory 3D inputs or ground-truth
3D annotations, where SR-3D accurately infers spatial relationships and metric
measurements.
